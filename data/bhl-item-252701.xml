The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.

By G. S. Webb
This was my sixteenth voyage to Africa as a collector, but my first
to Kenya Colony, and although well seasoned to travelling I was
quite thrilled at the prospect of seeing new country, new birds, and
different native tribes. I had previously been to the port of Mombasa
en passant but it is of no great interest, being very hot and steamy
with a cosmopolitan population comprised mostly of Indians, Arabs,
Goannese, and Natives, with a very small percentage of Europeans.
My objective was the far interior where I could come across many new
species of birds which only frequent the mountainous country. With
this object in view, I took the train to Nairobi some 330 miles inland.
It was rather disappointing that the only daily train left Mombasa late
in the afternoon, so that all the low bush country was passed through
.at night. I was very anxious to see such places as Tsavo, where in
the early days when the railway was being built the man-eating lions
completely held up the construction for a time, and were so fearless
that men were attacked and dragged out of the trucks at night. The
whole native population of this district was terrorized until the culprits
were finally shot. It is surprising what havoc a few man-eaters can
play, but fortunately these are few and far between, as the majority
of lions are quite afraid of human beings. Those which develop the

habit of attacking man are usually very old specimens, who find it
difficult to catch game, and once having sampled a native they seem
to prefer human blood and flesh to any other. The same applies to
crocodiles, although I cannot say if it is a question of age with them,
but it is certain that only a small percentage will attack man.
The country rises gradually on leaving the coast, and having gone
about 280 miles inland, the train reaches an altitude of about 5,000
feet, and we awake to find that the bush country has been left behind.
We now commence to cross the Kapiti and Athi Plains, an enormous
stretch of open country where one can see for miles and miles, and which
is a sanctuary for wild animals. It is an impressive sight and one never
to be forgotten. On both sides of the line vast herds of antelope can
be seen, the commonest being Kongoni, Thomson's, and Grant's
Gazelles, and Wildebeeste, also wild Ostriches and Grant's Zebras.
Occasionally lions can be seen, but this is a matter of luck, and Giraffe
are plentiful on the coastal side of these plains, where there is plenty
of bush for them to feed on. Of course, this type of country is of no
great interest to anyone wishing to see tropical bird-life, although
it is a fine sight to see a crowd of Vultures squabbling over the remains
of some animal which the lions have left after having had their fill.
The clarity of the atmosphere at this altitude is extraordinary and
Mount Kilimanjaro (19,700 feet) with its snow-capped peak can be
seen distinctly at a distance of 100 miles from the train, and from the
Aberdare Mountains where I did my collecting it can also be seen at
about 180 miles distant. After crossing the plains one reaches Nairobi
(5,500 feet), the capital of Kenya Colony. This marks the end of one
plateau, and on proceeding towards Uganda, the train rises rapidly
to the Kenya Highlands where nearly all the white settlers are situated,
growing coffee and maize, etc., and ranching. The line quickly rises
to 7,000 feet and soon one sees the great Rift Valley. This great trough
in the earth, formed in the days when Africa was dotted with active
volcanoes, was evidently caused by the shrinkage or collapse of the
earth's crust, for a very great distance, and it can be traced for hundreds
of miles, some parts being rather ill-defined owing to subsequent
volcanic action. In some places the Rift Valley is bordered by escarp-
ments with an almost sheer rise of 1,000 feet, and is about 20 miles

across. The country now becomes full of interest, as birds are numerous
as well as game, and the difference in bird-life in the Valley and above
the escarpment is remarkable. After following the edge for some
distance the line descends into the Rift Valley by a very difficult
course, and then reaches Lake Naivasha. This was my destination
as far as the railway was concerned, but from here I had to journey
about 25 miles north to the Aberdare Mountains over roads not easily
described without resorting to bad language.
Lake Naivasha is a beautiful sight and its shores are teeming with
bird-life, although very little in the way of rarities was to be seen.
The giant Acacia trees which surround the lake afford a home for
Blue-eared Glossy Starlings ( Lamprocolius chalybeus) and Superb
Starlings ( Spreo superbus), which are exceedingly numerous but do not
venture far from the lake. The Red-billed Wood-hoopoe ( Phoeniculus
purpureus) and White-fronted Bee-eater ( Melittoplnagus bullockoides)
are also common here. The only Sunbird I saw close to the lake was
Falkenstein's ( Cinnyris venustus falkensteini), which is extremely
beautiful with its shining blue upper parts and breast and light buff
belly. On the water the Red-knobbed Coot (Fulica cristata) is to be
seen in thousands, while in the reeds and among the water-lilies may be
seen the African Jacana or Lily-trotter ( Actophilus africanus) and the
Black Crake (Limnocorax flavirostra) . Waders are also fairly plentiful,
being mostly migrant Sandpipers from Europe, and the beautiful
Blacksmith Plover (. Hoplopterus armatus ) is to be met with sparingly.
But Ducks are getting scarce, as within recent years there has been
a boom in land sales round the edge of the lake, and houses are springing
up everywhere. These are mostly week-end residences for people in
Nairobi. It is completely spoiling this beautiful spot which was once
a sanctuary for all sorts of wildfowl, but now when the shooting season
opens one might imagine that there was another war on. The main
object seems to be to blot out as much as possible, even if you have to
throw the carcasses away, and a man who can boast that he has shot
fifty or more Ducks in a day imagines that he has done something really
clever. It is little wonder that few Ducks breed on Lake Naivasha now,
and the rarer kinds are almost non-existent. The country between
the lake and the escarpment some 10 miles across, known as the

Karati Bush, is more interesting and after a good deal of exploring one
may get a glimpse of that charming bird the Purple Grenadier Waxbill
(Granatina ianthinogaster), which belongs to the same genus as the
Violet-eared Waxbill ( G. granatina) but is much more beautiful. These
may sometimes be seen in semi-bare places in the bush, apparently
pecking in the soil. There are no seeding grasses in such places, and
probably never were, and it can only be concluded that they are eating
minute wind-borne seeds which are more easily found where the ground
is bare. In the tropics where the hot air is constantly causing miniature
whirlwinds, dust and small seeds and leaves, etc., are carried high into
the skies, and in this way the small dust-like seeds of many weeds
travel tremendous distances. This is particularly noticeable where a
clearing has been made in the middle of a big forest, where under
ordinary circumstances none of these weeds and plants can grow, but
immediately there is sufficient air and light they spring up in a few days,
although there may be no similar things growing within many miles.
It has happened sometimes that, after fields have been cultivated and
sown with grain, that there has been an invasion by Doves [Streptopelia)
which have been slaughtered wholesale, only to be proved by someone
with a little more knowledge, by examining the stomachs, that they
were not eating any grain at all, but were devouring the wind-borne
seeds of obnoxious weeds carried from fallow native lands, many miles
away. I mention this to illustrate that very little is known about
the economic value of birds, and if a little of the vast amount of money
which is spent in trying to find new sub-species were devoted to this
purpose it would be doing a service to mankind, and to the birds
themselves. Other rarities to be found in the Karati Bush were the
Kenya Highlands Scarlet-chested Sunbird (Chalcomitra senegalensis
lamperti), the Kenya Highlands Amethyst Sunbird (C. amethystina
doggetti), the Bronzy Sunbird (Nectarinia kilimensis ), the Golden-
winged Sunbird (Drepanorhynchus reichenowi), the Kenya Malachite
Sunbird {Nectarinia famosa cenigularis), and the Falkenstein's Sunbird
already mentioned.
These are all exceedingly beautiful. The Bronzy Sunbird,
Falkenstein's, and the two Chalcomitras do not go above the
escarpment. Besides Sunbirds there are also a fair quantity of Boilers

(Coracias caudatus), the rare d'Arnaud's Barbet (Trachyphonus
darnaudii), and the beautiful little Red-fronted Tinker-Barbet
(Pogoniulus pusillus). In this Bush there are still plenty of Buffalo
and that graceful antelope the Impala.
On climbing the escarpment one comes to open Highland plains
(8,000 feet) where the temperature is much lower than in the Rift
Valley, and again one sees game in plenty, especially Zebra, Kongoni,
and Thomson's Gazelles, which are exceedingly numerous and tame.
Ostriches are also fairly plentiful, and I once saw a herd of sixty-four
Eland, the largest of the African antelopes, which was a beautiful
sight.
An interesting Plover--the Black-winged ( Stephanibyx melanopterus)
--is to be found here and it is very partial to the paddocks where cattle
are herded at night near the homesteads. It was only seen at this
elevation, its place being taken by its near relative, the Crowned
Lapwing (, Stephanibyx coronatus), in the Rift Valley. All the African
Plovers do well in captivity and are very long-lived.
The base of the forest-clad Aberdare Mountains is a very peculiar
formation. Looking across the open country it looks for all the world
like rolling plains, practically treeless, but there are all sorts of unseen
wonders when you come to explore. The many streams which rise in
the Mountains flow through incredibly deep gorges, which are not visible
at a distance. They are not formed by the action of water, but by the
natural shrinkage of the earth's crust. Being thickly forested they are
full of interest, and near the water in shady places there are beautiful
ferns of all descriptions. To descend from the plains into one of these
gorges is almost like going to another country as far as bird-life is
concerned. Instead of seeing Pipits, Larks, Whydahs, and other
plain-loving species, one comes across denizens of the jungle such as
Hartlaub's Touracos ( Turacus hartlaubi), Narina Trogons (Apaloderma
narina), White-headed Wood-hoopoes (Phoeniculus bollei jacksoni),
White-starred Bush-robins (Pogonocichla stellata), and many Bulbuls,
Zosterops, and Flycatchers. Animals include the beautiful Colobus
monkeys and Bushbuck.
In the period corresponding with the English winter there are
a tremendous number of migrant Warblers from different parts of

Europe, and I learnt more about European birds here than I had
ever done in England. One of the commonest trees is the wild olive,
and when the berries are in season there is a sudden influx of vast
numbers of the beautiful Rameron Pigeons ( Columba arquatrix), also
Masai Red-headed Parrots ( Poicephalus gulielmi massaicus ) and
Sharpe's Starlings (Pholia sharpei).
The latter are so numerous that any nets set in the trees are certain
to catch many of these Starlings, thus preventing anything rare
from getting caught. As soon as the olive crop falls off a little all
these birds disappear as quickly as they came, but not so the Touracos.
They continue to live on olives almost exclusively for a long period
even though they may be hard to find. So used to olives are some
species of birds that it is very difficult to get them to eat anything
else for some time after capture. The Pigeons are said to be inedible
during this season owing to the flesh being tainted with olive oil, which
is very bitter and quite unlike the refined oil from cultivated trees.
The fruits or berries are almost round, and are about the size of
a cherry. The Parrots feed on the nuts inside the stones, whereas the
Touracos swallow the berries whole and then cough up the stones after
the fleshy part has digested.
On a few occasions I saw a small flock of not more than eight of the
pretty little Black-headed Waxbills ( Estrilda atricapilla kandti), a pair
of which I brought home. They are exceedingly difficult to catch as
they are not attracted by any bait in the form of seed, and I never
once saw them feeding on seeding grasses. They follow the mountain
streams in places where there is sufficient light to allow a small species
of rush to thrive, and it is on the seeds of these that they subsist.
Supplies of this had to be given for three weeks before the birds took
to millet, and they are certainly very difficult at first, but hardy enough
afterwards. I might mention that the temperature at night at this
altitude falls tremendously, and there is frequently a frost, although
it is only about 12 miles from the Equator.
The beautiful Golden-winged Sunbirds and Tacazze Sunbirds
(Nectarina tacazze) are to be found in the more open parts of the
river beds and deserted native " shambas ", for it is here that their
favourite food-plant, the leonotis, grows. To be seen at their best both

these very large species must be seen in the brilliant tropical sunlight,
and I think the Tacazze is perhaps the most beautiful Sunbird in the
world when so viewed, but it looks quite different in a cage where its
colours do not show up to the same extent. It is curious that all the
Golden-winged Sunbirds in the Rift Valley had the gold on the throat
and breast, and were considerably brighter than those from the Aberdare
Mountains, which were black in the parts mentioned. From about
October to March these highlands are teeming with European Yellow
Wagtails, both eastern and western forms. It is interesting to note that
many migrants arrive here in a weak and emaciated condition, having
made the long and trying journey from Europe as rapidly as possible,
whereas in the spring they proceed homewards in easy stages and are
in breeding condition soon after arrival.
In the forests of the Aberdare Mountains the rare and local Jackson's
Francolin {Francolinus jacksoni) is to be found, which is confined to the
Kenya Highlands. It is the largest of a very big genus and is quite
attractive to look at, but none of the African Francolins are at all
popular with aviculturists in England.
I must now mention the curious soda lakes to be found in the
Rift Valley. They are Lake Nakuru and Lake Elmemteita. These
waters are strongly impregnated with soda, and in the dry season when
the lakes shrink considerably there is a deposit of soda all round the
shores glistening like snow. The water has a very soft feel about
it and after wading in it a little while one's legs become quite white
where the water has dried and left a coating of soda. These lakes are
the home of the Lesser Flamingo ( Phoeniconaias minor), which are in
countless thousands. It is a magnificent sight and has to be seen to
be believed, the numbers being almost incredible. They are so close
together that when disturbed the outside ones have to rise first before
the inner ones can flap their wings. It is a mystery at first sight
what such an army can live on, as there is nothing noticeable in the
water and the lake is devoid of vegetation. A close inspection will
reveal a very minute crustacean in the water, which is in myriads and
is hardly larger than the larvae of mosquitos, and this must be their
main diet. These Flamingos are only half the size of the Greater
Flamingo ( Phoenicopterus ruber) and belong to a different genus. In

the latter species the upper mandible fits over the lower, whereas in the
Lesser Flamingo, it fits into the lower.
They are extremely difficult to trap as they are very wary and will
not go near any nets or snares placed in the water. Even a stick is
enough to arouse their suspicions. The strong winds which sweep down,
first from one mountain and then another, changing very rapidly, also
interfere with any netting operations and causes very strong currents.
No doubt, in the rainy season when the water rises to the surrounding
vegetation and when the birds are nesting, they would be easily caught.
It is strange that they never visit Lake Naivasha which is only a few
miles distant, but is fresh water. It is also noticeable that Flamingos
in captivity do not look as well in places where they have fresh water
as in places where it is somewhat polluted. Perhaps the finest specimens
in England are to be seen in the London Zoo where the water in their
pond is far from being fresh. I was surprised to find Hippo in these
soda lakes and Cape Widgeon (Anas capensis) were very numerous :
a pretty species which I believe has not yet reached Europe. Black-
smith Plovers are met with sparingly and remain always near the
water's edge, and there are numbers of the European Sandpipers.
It is quite interesting driving a car at night in this area as the eyes
of the various animals reflect strongly, the most noticeable being
Impala and the curious Jumping Hare (Pedetes surdaster) which pro-
gresses in the same manner as a Kangaroo.
Collecting in Kenya, and especially in the Aberdare Mountains, is
a somewhat strenuous business, as at this altitude it does not take much
exercise to make one puff and blow' and it is difficult to go anywhere
without descending and climbing the deep gorges. Everything has to
be caught by oneself, which means walking miles and miles and climbing
trees and steep gradients, for the natives are of no assistance whatever.
Most settlers will tell you that this region would be one of the finest
on earth to live in, if only the natives had a little intelligence, for they
certainly try one's patience to the utmost. I am speaking of the Kikuyu
tribe, surely one of the lowest physically, and mentally, in Africa. They
have not survived through any fighting qualities, but by receding into
the forests whenever attacked by the neighbouring Masai. These
latter are a fine race physically and live on the open plains, their chief

mission in life being to produce as many cattle as possible, for they
live almost entirely on the blood and milk of these animals but never
touch the wild game. There is no doubt that this warlike tribe, but
for European settlement, would have eventually driven the Kikuyu
off the map, as most of the forests have been burnt to make way
for cattle. The various tribes have now been allotted well-defined
reserves and under European protection they are not allowed to fight.
To get an idea of the intelligence of the Kikuyu, he is best seen at night
when he is asleep. You may then shout, roll him over, or pull his nose,
but all to no avail. He is like some animal gone torpid and reminds
one more of a sloth than a human being. If you wish to bring him
back to life quickly, a bucket of cold water is fairly successful and I
have been told that propping the head up with a forked stick and then
lighting a fire under it is also quite effective. This may not be too good
for the exterior of the cranium, but there is certainly nothing inside it
to hurt. Even " boys " who have been trained for a long period cannot
be trusted, and are always doing something idiotic when you least
expect it. An amusing example of this was when my host and hostess
had rather a lot of visitors one day and the house boy couldn't find
room for sufficient knives and forks when laying the table for lunch.
After a little deep " thinking " he laid a place for the odd guest right in
the centre of the table. No doubt he thought that the powers of the
white man were unlimited and that the person in question could stand
upside down on the ceiling and eat his lunch off the centre of the table
without being in anybody else's way.
In this region I heard quite a lot about the " Nandi Bear ". This
is a mythical beast which hundreds of people have " seen " and is, of
course, the survival of some native belief which is now well rooted in
the minds of many local Europeans. Many countries have similar
elusive creatures and in Australia the " Bunyip " is known far and
wide. This is a monster which inhabits rivers, but is most frequently
reported from the neighbourhood of bars and has even been
seen crawling up the walls and in these situations is usually green in
colour. So far all attempts to shoot or capture one have failed but
" Bunyip " stories are as numerous as ever.
It seems that most people really love to believe in something

<bodyText confidence="0.976559833333333" page_id="56219434"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
almost daily one hears of queer habits of existing creatures. Round
any camp fire, or place where people are gathered together recalling
hair-raising experiences and peculiar animals they have seen, one
hears of the Hoop Snake, which puts its tail in its mouth and rolls
down hills in the manner of a hoop. There are other wonderful snakes
which jump backwards for colossal distances, and I once had a snake
described to me which " roared like a lion ". Another interesting
animal is the porcupine which " shoots its quills ". It is not certain
whether William Tell studied the antics of one of these before having
a go at the apple. It is, of course, very thrilling to imagine that you
are in great danger the moment you set foot in any part of Africa, and
while on the subject of imagination I must mention that most people
in Africa at some time or another have been chased by that terrible
monster the Black Mamba. This snake " attacks man on sight " and
if bitten you are " dead within a minute
Almost every African newspaper contains thrilling stories about
them, but it is strange that the London Zoo has never had ope, and I
have been knocking round the wilder part of Africa ever since the war
and have never seen one.
There is certainly a dark phase of the green Mamba which is no more
aggressive or venomous than the typical form, but usually it is not even
this which figures so largely in snake stories. Any black snake such
as the Ringhals, or Black Cobra, or even a dark-coloured Boomslang,
is taken to be a Black Mamba. To all intents and purposes, this snake,
like many other wonderful things, is imaginary, although I daren't
say so in Africa. I should probably be " certified ", or deported as an
undesirable.
By the time this appears in print, I shall be on my way to the
Usambara Mountains in Tanganyika Territory, where I hope to collect
many specimens new to Europe.

The Long-tailed Cuckoo (Urodynamis taitiensis)
A Maori told me that in the old days before the coming of the
white man, the first call of the Cuckoo was a signal for the planting
of the kumeras, the native sweet potato, and even to-day should a
native run out of these vegetables, his neighbours will ask, " Where
were you when the Cuckoo called ? "
This very handsome Cuckoo is a migrant to New Zealand from
the Western Pacific Islands, and I frequently made its acquaintance
in the Urewera country, and also at the Little Barrier. At first sight
it rather resembles an immature European Cuckoo, but on close
examination it will be found that the plumage is most beautifully
patterned with varying shades of brown. It is a fairly lengthy bird,
but of exceeding slimness. Its call was one of the most characteristic
sounds of the forests on the Barrier, but the bird itself was very
impatient of observation. It is not a common bird on the mainland,
but is plentiful in the island sanctuaries.
It mainly hides away in the dense bush, for as soon as it emerges
into the open it is persecuted by the smaller birds, especially by the
Tuis. These birds make combined assaults on the Cuckoo and use
every endeavour to drive it from the neighbourhood.
Whilst at Waikaremoana I spent the whole of a morning observing
one of these handsome birds. It seemed practically tame, but I rather
think that it was too frightened to leave its leafy refuge owing to the
abundance of Tuis in the vicinity. Usually the birds are very difficult
to observe. On the Barrier Island the birds seemed to utter their
extremely loud notes from the higher foliage of some of the giant
forest trees, such as the kauri, etc. So shy and retiring is it that one
finds it very difficult to become acquainted with much detail of its
wild fife.
The New Zealand Kingfisher (Halcyon s. vagans)
This fine Kingfisher is a very near relation of the Australian Sacred
Kingfisher [Halcyon sanctus), and is distributed over the whole of New

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
Zealand, being quite common in many parts but scarce in others.
At Takahue, a remote farming district near the North Cape, I found
this species quite common and on my arrival there found that it was
the breeding season. All along the Takahue Valley it appeared to be,
if not the commonest bird, the most conspicuous one. Every few
hundred yards one was sure to be greeted by the loud raucous calls
of a pair of these birds as one approached their nest. Their cry is
somewhat like the scolding note of the European Blackbird.
The nesting sites differ ; the birds dig either into an old decayed
tree stump or into a high bank. The nests are often made in the most
accessible positions and often only a few feet from the ground. One
old willow tree by the river was literally riddled with holes made by
the Kingfishers, as also was a high cutting on the mountain road
which was very little used.
This bird is over twice the size of the European Kingfisher, and
belongs to an entirely different genus which does not obtain its food
by fishing ; in fact, fish form but a very small part of its menu. Most
of its food consists of various land animals such as lizards, beetles,
worms, centipedes, mice, etc., which it picks up from the ground.
A bird will take up its position on a dead tree stump and very little
in the way of edible insects escapes its exceedingly keen eyes. This
bird is not averse to visiting gardens in the towns if it can obtain
an adequate food supply.
When wandering in the mountains near Takahue, I chanced to
come across a nest of this species in a bank by the roadside, about
3 feet from the ground, it was only about a foot in depth ; in fact,
I have never come across a nest placed in such an accessible position.
It contained two young ones in the " pin-feather " stage. Thinking
that they would be easy to rear, I took them. The first night I put
them in a box filled with dry earth and covered them with wool, but
in the morning I found that they had swallowed quantities of the
wool and earth. I tried feeding them on insectivorous food mixed
with chopped egg, which had been sent from Auckland. This they
vomited up. We tried earthworms, but they appeared to grow weaker
and lose strength. Then one of the young boys on the farm where
I was staying devised an impromptu net, made of a piece of sacking

and wire, for catching a tiny and almost transparent fish found in the
rivers in the district.
The method of netting them was to wade into the stream, lay the
net on the bed of the river, weighted down by stones, then stir up
the mud at the bottom with one foot. This attracted the fish, and
as the shoal came over the net it was raised. In this way we caught
hundreds in a day. After this, the birds were fed on the fish and they
never looked back ; they ceased vomiting the food up, soon regained
their lost weight and would snatch the fishes as soon as they touched
the beak. They thrived apace, soon getting their feathers. At last
the day came to leave and return to Auckland ; the day before, we
collected a large bucketful of the koriwockas, as the Maoris in the district
called them, and put the reward of our many hours' labours in a bucket
outside the farmhouse door, but alas ! half-a-dozen hungry ducks
discovered the succulent feast and made short work of it. The " service
car " left at 5.30 a.m. on an eighty-mile journey to catch the train,
so there was no time to get a fresh supply. There were thirty left,
one each per hour for the long railway journey. One is not supposed
to take livestock into the carriages, but it did not seem a very large
parcel, so I thought it would remain undiscovered. Every hour I took
the package to the rear of the carriage and fed the youngsters, but
after the first hour or two they protested against the inadequacy of
the food supply. Their cries were not so bad at first, but, as time went
on, they increased in volume until at last it sounded as though there
were two cats having a desperate fight in the compartment. It was
a slow train, a station every few miles ; as soon as the brakes began
to be applied, the wretched birds started calling louder until by the
time the train had stopped their cries were almost deafening. The
long saloon carriage was full almost to crowding capacity, and inquiring
looks were cast from all quarters in my direction. To say the least
it was extremely embarrassing. At the first station where there was
a buffet, I purchased ham sandwiches and tried to feed them upon
the ham, but no, they knew the difference between ham and fish, and
the former was speedily vomited up. I felt sure that the guard would
ask me to leave the carriage with my screaming charges, but as luck
would have it whenever he came in the din seemed to die down for
several minutes.

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
To cut a long story short ; after an interminable length of time,
about fifteen hours, but it seemed more like fifty to me, we arrived
in Auckland. The birds were almost exhausted by this time, and my
first action was to hail a taxi, ask for the nearest fish shop, and purchase
filleted flounder. This was cut up in the taxi with the aid of the driver's
knife and administered to the starving Kingfishers. They seemed to
thrive for a time on this. Then we went away for a week-end on the
West Coast, and the birds were taken with us. We found an abundance
of live food on the beach for them, tiny flounders, shrimps, crabs, etc.
Then we went back to town and away to Little Barrier Island. The
birds had to be left. Some kind friends took them and for a time they
seemed to do well. Then the smaller one died. By the time I got back
the survivor was nearly adult size, but in a few weeks he, too, joined
his companion. I was sorry, for he was a dear little thing and so tame,
but there is little live food to be got in a city, and I am afraid that
the raw meat and fish were insufficient to support him. So vanished
all my dreams of bringing these interesting birds to England, and
I regretted wasting the lives of two of New Zealand's most beautiful
birds.
The White-breasted Tit (Petroica toitoi)
Wherever there are patches of native " bush " one is sure to see
this delightful little creature. In all the heavily forested regions it is
very common and perhaps one of the most confiding and familiar
denizens of those parts ; and upon entering the forest one is almost
sure to make its acquaintance before that of any other bird. It is
exceedingly inquisitive and will come within a few feet and make
a thorough examination of the intruder. It is usually the strikingly
coloured male that is in evidence and not the sombrely clad female ;
that keeps in the background.
Although in its demeanour it exhibits the same restless activity
as the European Tits, it is not closely related to them. Around the
cultivated patches and clearings on the edge of the remaining forest
areas, this bird becomes exceedingly familiar, very much like our own
native robin, watching the gardener at work and frequently alighting
on his spade as it comes for the grubs which are turned over in the

soil. The striking black and white plumage renders it one of the most
conspicuous birds of the forest ; the plumage is loose and fluffy, the
tail is carried in an upright position and the wings lowered. A striking
feature is the large shining beady black eye. Just above the beak
are two spots of shining white feathers, which are at normal times
concealed but when displaying and fighting are exposed.
The Tit is common throughout the whole of the North Island and
especially so in the various island sanctuaries. In fact, one can never
walk through a patch of forest without seeing two or three pairs of
these interesting little birds. They are usually found only in pairs
as the birds seem to exercise territorial rights over certain given areas
and will not tolerate other birds of their species in that particular
part. This Tit is one of New Zealand&amp;apos;s most useful birds, feeding solely
on small insects that infest the trees and lower vegetation in the forests.
I find that I have very few notes of this bird, though I was perhaps
more familiar with it than any other, I regret that I rather overlooked
it in seeking the rarer ones.
It would doubtless make a very charming cage-bird, and with a
good insectivorous food should present no difficulties in keeping.
The Whitehead (Mohoua albicilla)
This is exclusively a forest bird and is not found in any of the
cultivated districts. To find this beautiful and very distinct bird one
has to penetrate far from the beaten track into the " back blocks "
or into the large Government reserves and there one is sure to meet
with flocks of the inquisitive little Whiteheads. On hearing their
short sweet song, one has only to sit down, whistle a few notes in
imitation of it and in a few minutes the Whiteheads will be around
showing the utmost interest in the intruder.
Extremely active, as are all the small forest birds of New Zealand,
this species keeps in small companies and moves in a quick and business-
like way through the forests searching minutely every cranny and
nook as it passes along for small insects upon which it mainly feeds,
. uttering all the time its short but very sweet song.
On the Little Barrier, these delightfully friendly little birds were
decidedly common, in fact one would think that they were the

commonest birds on the island. Lacking the pugnacious qualities of
most of New Zealand's birds, they are singularly friendly to one
another and also to human beings. As the small agile flocks pass
through the forest and spy the traveller, first one and then another
will come down to within a few feet, taking full note of the intruder
before passing on. One would imagine them saying, " Hello, pleased
to see you, but sorry that I cannot stop." To my mind theirs is the
most musical song of all the birds inhabiting the New Zealand forests,
not loud, nor is it sustained, but what there is of it is incredibly sweet,
in fact they have earned for themselves the vernacular name of " bush
canary ". Like most of their other forest companions they have a
great variety of notes. One flock which I occasionally encountered
during my stay on the Barrier had a very striking call ; a male would
whistle " Diddly, diddly, dee " very distinctly, and his mate would
answer in a lower and softer strain the same call. I only heard the
birds in this one flock utter this very distinctive call.
In their actions, the Whiteheads greatly resemble the Zosterops, in
moving restlessly from one part of the forest to another, never for
one moment still. During their search for insects they assume all
manner of poses, often running like a Creeper up the branches or trunks
of the trees. On the mainland the Whitehead is scarce, for it is not
a bird which has in any way adapted itself to the conditions of
civilization, and as the forest disappears so does the friendly little
Whitehead, and no doubt in the years to come when most of the
remaining forest tracts have been burned, like the Stitchbird, it will
find on Little Barrier one of its last refuges.
The names of the Little Barrier Island and the Whitehead are to
me synonymous, for it is impossible to think of one without the other.
This bird is about the size of a Sparrow, and of a cinereous brown,
the whole head, neck, and upper breast, pure white, fading to grey
where it meets the brown. The female has the white parts much
greyer.
The Whitehead is one of the few birds which have made a welcome
reappearance during the last twenty years or so. Buller, in his great
work on the birds of New Zealand, speaking of the Whitehead, says
" The last-named was certainly at that time the commonest bird of

the country, its cheerful chirping note being heard on every hand,
whilst its nest might be confidently looked for in every suitable clump
of undergrowth. Now the banks are silent and the Whitehead has
gone ! " From 1880 or so, the bird was to all intents and purposes
extinct on the mainland, while a small number existed on the Little
Barrier, a prey to every avaricious collector who cared to make a
journey over there. A matter of twenty years or so ago the Bird
Protection Act was brought in and ever since then the Whitehead
has steadily come back to the forest reserves, until now it is found
in many places on the mainland. As mentioned before, from a mere
remnant on the Little Barrier, it is now the commonest bird on the
island, everywhere one goes from the highest peaks to the nanuka
scrub by the seashore one is sure to find flocks of them. So strongly
is the gregarious spirit developed that one never sees a solitary bird,
they are always in small flocks. This is perhaps the only true endemic
bird which does so.
The Kara or New Zealand Nestor (.Nestor meridionalis)
In the Maori language, the name of the lovely Lake Waikari-iti
(3,000 ft. above sea level) means " Little Sea of Glittering Waters "
and the full significance of this is brought home when one sees for the
first time its sparkling crystal waters.
Between this lake and its sister Lake Wai-karemoana, which is a
thousand feet lower, is a forest reserve with a walk of over six miles
through the most wonderful virgin forest and it was in these glades of
unsurpassed splendour that I had ample opportunities of observing this
strange aberrant parrot, for in this forest it is to be found perhaps
more plentifully than anywhere else in the North Island to-day. In
other parts the birds are few and far between and very wary, no doubt
owing to the incessant persecution, for the Kaka was esteemed alike
by the white man and the Maori for food. In fact, such an important
.article of diet was it to the natives that battles have been fought
regarding certain areas containing a plentiful supply of the birds.
At Waikaremoana the Kaka was comparatively tame and one
day, when on the bush track coming down from the higher lake, I had

the most amusing encounter with these birds. I was attracted by the
cries of three of them in a very high forest tree in which the birds were
searching for wood-boring grubs. Sitting down near the tree I whistled
and made various noises ; after a minute or two the birds stopped their
work and became very attentive ; eventually they descended lower
and lower, whistling and calling and making altogether an amazing
variety of sounds. Finally, they began to " show off " very much as
an Amazon or Grey Parrot does when spoken to. I continued to
whistle and call, and eventually the noise attracted the Kakas from
the neighbourhood, until at last twelve or more were within twenty
feet or so, all calling and screaming at once. How long this strange
concert would have lasted I do not know, but, getting tired and short
of breath with so much whistling, I moved away and the birds then
dispersed in different directions.
The Kaka is another bird which requires large areas of forest to
support it. As soon as the forest burning begins and settlement creeps
in, the Kaka disappears, and it is only far from the beaten track,
especially where there are large areas of protected forest, that one is
at all likely to see this Parrot. As long as these areas are preserved
there is no danger of the Kaka becoming extinct. If once these
districts are given over to settlement, of which there is a danger,
with a change of Government, it will not only mean the death-knell
of the Kaka, but many other birds as well. Fortunately, this bird
is very plentiful on both the island sanctuaries of Little Barrier and
Kapati, so there is no danger of its becoming extinct altogether.
The Nestoridse is the family to which this bird belongs, and is
composed of large and sombrely-coloured Parrots confined now to New
Zealand and represented by only two species, this and the better-known
Kea. Formerly there were several other species much brighter in colour
than the two surviving ones. How many there were we shall never
know, for they are now extinct except these two already mentioned.
There are skins and records of three more, one from Lord Howe Island,
another from Norfolk Island, and the strangest of all from Philip
Island, a small islet only a few miles from Norfolk Island. Without
a doubt there were more of these strange birds confined to the various
Antipodean Islands, but owing to their size and edible qualities they

were soon exterminated when the island became inhabited by human
beings.
There is little doubt that New Zealand and the surrounding islands
are the remains of a vast tropical continent which in the course of time
has become submerged and the remaining portions much more
temperate in climate than formerly. The Nestors gradually adapted
themselves to the changed environment and with the change in climate
the Parrots put on a more sombre colouring, while those on the islands
nearer the equator retained their more brilliant plumage.
Very often in the Kaka we see traces of atavism or throw-backs
to the remote ancestry or revision to ancestral type. These specimens
have in time past caused great confusion to naturalists, and the birds
have been named as different species such as Nestor esslingi, Nestor
superbus, Nestor montanus, and many others, but to my mind they are
merely throw-backs to the more brilliantly-coloured primitive types.
The Kaka seems to have descended from some type of aberrant
Lory, or at least a connecting-link between the Lories and the proper
Parrots. Many of these brilliantly-coloured specimens, in which red
predominates, are very Lory-like indeed. All its demeanour in the
trees is that of a Lory ; it has all the quick whisking movements of
the latter birds, its progression is rather by quick bounding hops than
by climbing, its tongue is brush-tipped, a great portion of its food
being derived from the nectar of the flower-bearing forest trees, and
a glance at the long, slender beak shows that it has no true affinities
with the true Parrots. In reality, the Kaka, in spite of its looks, is
a large and very aberrant Lory, having many superficial characteristics
in common with the strange Presquet's Parrot of New Guinea. I think
that in time we shall find that this latter bird is also a type of Lory.
In common with the other members of the Parrot tribe in New
Zealand, this bird will at times nest quite near to the ground, and
I was shown on Kapati Island a nest where the eggs had been laid
only a few inches from the level of the ground in a decayed tree stump.
The clutch consists of four rather large, white eggs.
In the years gone by the Kaka was greatly esteemed as a pet by
the natives, in fact nearly every Maori village had one, usually an
accomplished talker and mimic, which also acted as a decoy when

tlie natives speared the wild birds for eating purposes. The natives
made special perches for the birds, some of them beautifully carved
and inlaid. I saw many of these in different parts of the country ;
they were called tutu-haha. These perches were also used for catching
the birds, a noose being attached which, when the bird alighted, was
pulled by the native who was concealed nearby. Many Kakas were
also kept by the old settlers who stated that they were the most
delightful pets, being very intelligent and full of life. Nowadays, it
is very rare to find a Kaka in captivity. Many people have had them
up to a few years ago, but I only came across one specimen, an
exceedingly fine bird and very tame. I used every endeavour to try
to obtain it, but failed to do so. I am sure that it was the only one
in captivity in New Zealand.
In former years when the whole of New Zealand was covered with
the wonderful sub-tropical forest, Kakas existed in countless thousands,
if not millions, and they formed a goodly percentage of the animal
food of the Maoris. How they were trapped and preserved for future
use is well described by Buller in his Birds of New Zealand. This
work is certainly the finest of any works dealing with the birds of
any single country, and provides a mine of information for the
ornithologist.
In flight, this bird resembles a hawk ; not having the swift direct
flight of most Parrots, it flies with an ease and grace unknown to the
majority of the Parrot tribe. Towards the evening these birds indulge
in wonderful aerial exercises. Rising up from the forest uttering their
harsh, grating cries, they ascend in huge spirals until they are almost
lost to view in the heavens. Often they rise up and sweep round with
hardly a motion of their outstretched pinions. That this Parrot is
semi-nocturnal there is little doubt, for it is active long after dark
has fallen and it can be heard high in the skies far into the night.
I made the acquaintance of the so-called Green Kaka in Stewart
Island. Its name is rather a misnomer for there is no trace of green
in the plumage, and it seems to differ in no way whatever from the
bird of the North Island. It is intensely inquisitive, and one has only
to call or whistle loudly and one is soon surrounded by a dozen or
so Kakas all shrieking and uttering a great variety of sounds, for no

bird in the forest has such a repertoire as this one. It is when
surrounded by a flock of excited birds as they hop and skip from
one branch to another that their affinity to the Lories is so very
apparent.
Sad to relate, Stewart Island is a veritable slaughter ground for
these interesting birds ; parties of people with launches come over
from the mainland and indulge in Pigeon- and Kaka-shooting
expeditions. They sail up the quiet inlets where there is no fear of
detection and make heavy bags of both of these birds. We found
many piles of Kaka heads and feathers and often freshly-killed birds.
It seems as though little can be done to stop this disgusting slaughter,
for the island is very large and it is impossible to have rangers about
all the time.
The food of this bird is mainly berries and fruit from the various
forest trees ; it also sucks the nectar from the honey-bearing flowers
with the aid of its brush-tipped tongue. It finds much of its sustenance
in the large wood-boring grubs, and to reach them it will bite through
thick branches of living wood. It is amazing the depth to which it
will bore through the wood. The Maoris tell me that the birds listen
for the grubs and then bite into the wood until they are reached.
The Kaka is about the size of the Lemon-crested Cockatoo and
a peculiar shade of greyish-brown, each feather edged with a darker
colour ; the crown is light grey, the ear-coverts yellow or orange-red,
the lower parts, rump, lower, and upper tail-coverts, dull crimson ;
the feathers around the hind neck are often suffused with this colour.
The under-wing-coverts are bright scarlet, barred with brown. Prom
these latter feathers the Maoris make many of their beautiful feather
cloaks. Incredible patience must have been used in the manufacture
of one of these garments and the feathers of many hundreds of birds
must have been used in the making of a large one.

[The following article is reproduced, by permission , from the Fifth
Annual Report of the Avicultural Society of New Zealand, from which we
shall hope to publish further extracts at a later date. The Editorial notes
are by the Editor of that Report .]
Being a lover of New Zealand native birds, I have studied them
in their natural state in the heavy forests of the North Island ever
since I can remember, which takes me back fifty years.
When only a small boy 6 years old (I had only just arrived with
my parents from England) we settled in a small township called
Ashhurst, at the mouth of the Manawatu Gorge. On the one side of us
was the Ruahine Range, untouched by man, and the home of the
famous Huia, and on the other side for hundreds of miles dense bush
with small townships here and there ; so I was in a position to see and
study most of the birds in that area. The forest at that time was
teeming with bird life, and a more joyous and happy family (to judge
by the beautiful singing and the fluttering of countless wings) could
not be found. It was an experience one could never forget. These
joyous sounds were more in evidence early in the morning of a bright
sunny day, and yet often after a spell of wet weather, when the birds
seemed to try and make up for lost time and outdo each other in
song, I always gave the honour in this direction to the Tui,
whose beautiful notes I have often listened to on a bright moonlight
summer night when the bush was still. He sings at intervals right
through the night and his notes then are the more golden with no other
sounds to spoil the effect. You also get the full benefit of the bell-like
notes.
At that time our native birds had very few natural enemies besides
man, and the forests supplied an abundance of food for every kind of
bird in the way of honey flowers, berries, insects, etc., so it is no
wonder bird life was so happy and free. The predominating species
at that time were the Pigeon, Tui, and Kaka. They were in their
countless thousands.
A sight I never shall forget was when a very large flock of Pigeons

got weather-bound in a small patch of bush near our school in the
township for some days. It cleared up late in the afternoon after
school hours, and all of a sudden the mob rose out of the bush--the
noise was terrific--there must have been between five and six hundred
of them, and if anybody had asked me at that time I would have said
thousands by the noise they made with their wings. To realize what
I mean one has only to hear a single Pigeon rising out of the bush.
This mob had evidently been on its way to new feeding grounds when
overtaken by bad weather.
The Pigeon's chief food in those days, in season, was first tawa,
then white pine, miro, and finally late in the winter hineau berries.
On the latter the Pigeons get very fat and are too lazy to fly much.
I have seen them shot and burst when they struck the ground. These
berries are also taken by the Tui and Kaka, but we all know the Tui
is a honey-eater through the spring and summer months while the
poor Pigeon has to live on leaves and loses his condition, and then is the
time to see how swift he is on the wing for so large a bird.
The Kaka can change his diet, too ; he loves to get a dead standing
pine-tree full of hu hu grubs, of which there were plenty in our forests :
trees that had lived their span, rotting away and making room for
others to follow. I have spent many pleasant hours watching Kakas
busy on a dead tree, ripping out lumps of rotten wood with their
strong beaks, looking for grubs. It was amusing to see the way, when
a large lump was dropped, they watched it hit the ground before
starting on the next piece.
One day in recent years I was going along a track in my bush and
was passing a big dead Rimu and got a hard knock on the top of my
head, and I glanced up and saw Mr. Kaka looking down at me with
a mischievous look on his face (at least I thought so) ; he seemed quite
pleased at the result of his shot.
I am sure one could not be gloomy watching a mob of these birds ;
they are so happy, mischievous, and funny, and their whistle call to
their mates is worth hearing--it is very loud and clear. I have often
wondered why the Kaka seems at his best in dull wet weather or just
before or after heavy rain (this applies to the Huia too). My theory
is that perhaps the grubs in the trees come more to the surface in dull

wet weather and the birds have a good time ; it seems a shame they
are so few and far between these days.
Anyway, going back again to between forty and fifty years ago, all
the vast bush was quickly taken up for settlement, this resulting
in thousands of acres being felled and burnt each year, and gradually
the birds were forced further back until the high, rough, hilly country
and mountain ranges were their only place of refuge, and nearly all
their feeding grounds were destroyed. I think before the next genera-
tion our beautiful native Pigeon will be a thing of the past [the Pigeon
has shown a marked increase of recent years in some districts.-- Ed.],
and our children to come will blame us if our Government do not set
aside large reserves of native bush--the rougher the better--
in the back country well away from cities, towns, and roads--
and man if possible. Country that is unfit for farming. We have so
much like that in the North Island ; yet much good bush has been
destroyed, abandoned, and is now just waste going back to scrub and
fern ; forests that could have given our native birds like Pigeon, Kaka,
Tui, native Parrakeet, Crow ( Kokako ) (who by the way I still think
should have the honour of being our Bellbird) their natural food, and
I do not think there is any substitute for them.
Our beautiful Parrakeet seems to be dying quicker than the others.
I have only seen one pair in the last seven years in the Manawahe
forest.
Fourteen years ago, when I first came here, they were fairly common.
I saw the last pair about two months ago in a bit of reserve bush I
have close to my home. They only stopped a short time, chattered a lot,
then left.
I remember, as a boy, when they were plentiful, being amused
by their cry in the evenings when flying to their roosting places, always
in pairs. It sounded just like " Good evening ", " Good evening
We really thought they said " Good evening " ; it is the only call I have
heard, but they make a lot of chattering noises when feeding and
rearing their young. They are beautiful talkers when caught young
and trained. It was quite common then to see them in the settlers'
homes, but alas ! they never lived many years without their freedom
and natural foods. [There is a bird in Auckland to-day which has
been seventeen years in captivity.-- Ed.]

Bushfellers would find the nests high up in holes in the big trees
when felling the bush, and give the young birds to the nearest settlers,
if unhurt, wdien the tree fell. They were always in great demand.
I enjoy writing about the Tui, or Parson Bird as he is commonly
called. He seems very proud of that white tuft of feathers on his
throat, and rolls it up and down like an Adam's apple when he bursts
into song. When younger I could imitate the calls of most of our
native birds and I used to delight in giving the distress cry of the female
Tui. All the cock birds would come that were in the vicinity with their
feathers all fluffed up looking for a fight and very angry. But they soon
took a tumble and left me on my own again. The distress call sounds
like a long string of " pee-pee-pee ". It is, I find, one of the hardest
calls to imitate. You have to make it with the lips and throat, not the
tongue. At one time the Tui was supposed to be the Game Bird of our
forests, and he could be a bit of a bully. I have seen him tormenting
the inoffensive Pigeon until showers of white breast-feathers were
flying in all directions. Anyway, I know of one imported bird about
his own size that is too many for him, the Starling, but the Tui is the
one who always starts the trouble and then is glad to get back to the
bush again.
Watching the Tui in the shade of the forest you would think it was
just a plain black colour, but when it starts darting about in the sun
you are surprised at the flashes of beautiful blue-green of its plumage.
In the early days before flax mills started there were thousands of
acres of flax bushes in virgin state, and in the summer months there
was a sea of flax sticks in flower, heavy with honey, and then the Tuis
would leave the bush and have a glorious time. That was the time
to hear their song. They also love the gum-tree flowers, and will travel
long distances to them in season even when growing close to towns.
When I first came to the Manawahe my farm was nearly all heavy
bush, and after felling and burning it and sowing with grass seed I
used to notice the Pigeons flying on to the ground, a thing I had never
seen them do before, so I got curious and waited my chance, and
finally found out they were fond of the lumps of new cow grass (large
clover). It surprised me to see the way and the amount they ate in a
short time. It is said the Wild Pigeon is a timid bird, but I have proved

they are not ; it is only shooting that makes them afraid of man.
When I have been fencing-off a new burn the Pigeons would after the
first few days (when they found I did not harm them) sit on the stumps
and logs in the sun quite close to where I was working, and some-
times on the top of the posts I had just erected, so that shows they are
not naturally shy or timid.
Now I must tell you something about another old favourite of
mine, the Weka, or Wood Hen. When I first came here I made sure
I would see and hear them again, but was greatly disappointed to find
they had died out. When a boy living in the Manawatu district, there
were hundreds of them around the township of Ashhurst, and in the
evening, just as it was getting dark, you would hear them calling to one
another. If rain was coming you would hear them calling for miles
around. They seemed, like the Kaka, to know. The settlers used to
say " Rain coming. Did you notice how the wood hens were calling " ?
Their call just sounds like " More wet ". They are chiefly night birds,
but I have seen them come to a camp door in the shade of the bush
in the daytime and eat scraps we would give them.
We used to wonder where our soap, spoons, etc., went, until we found
the thieves were the Wekas, who seem to have a failing for bright
things, and are full of mischief.
Being a flightless bird, they have very powerful legs and beak,
which I know to my sorrow, for when a boy I tried to carry one home
alive, but was glad to let it go. They are very swift runners, but with
the coming of dogs to New Zealand they have had no chance, or against
the cat, stoats, and weasels either. I remember seeing some of their
eggs found by a bushman under the roots of a tree. I was struck
by their beautiful shape. They were tapered and about the size of a big
pullet's egg, white, with spots on the big end. I forget what colour
the spots were, but I know they were dark. There were three eggs
in the nest. They are very hardy birds and could be fed in places
safe from dogs, cats, etc., and I believe we could have them in their
hundreds again.
Another bird friend here is the native Ground Lark, one of the
most friendly birds I know. It does not matter if you are at
the cowshed, digging, ploughing, stumping, and clearing up logs, you

will always find one or two pairs with you. Of course they are after
the grubs and insects you disturb in the soil. Every spring when I
start digging in my garden I have scarcely begun when I feel sure
the same birds come year after year ; one seems on the look out, and
you will hear a very cheerful cheep 44 Here he is again ", and you will
hear his mates answer and come at once : very seldom more than two
pairs, and often only one. I am sorry to say they fight a lot, so perhaps
that is why you never see many together. It is strange, being ground
birds, that they have been able to hold their own. They are a much
finer looking bird than the imported Skylarks, and it is a pity they
have no song. Their nest is built on the ground, and is similar to
that of the Skylark, but I have noticed they always pick the side of
a hillock to insure the nest keeping dry and not so liable to be trampled
on by animals, a thing I have often seen happen to the nests of other
Larks. Their plumage is not very striking, but they are very trim and
neat, and they look very dainty hopping about.
Another native ground bird, which I am sorry to say has died out,
is the native Quail. Between forty and fifty years ago, on the Ashhurst
flat (opposite Manawatu Gorge), the native Quail were in their hundreds,
and many a scare I have had from them while running in the early
morning to get our cows. You could not see them when they were
hiding. Nature making them the same colour as their surroundings,
you would be on the point of walking over a mob when all of a sudden
a whirl almost in your face : this first explosion seemed a signal for the
rest, the mob would whirl away one at a time. Very seldom would
you see two rise together, although there were generally about twenty to
thirty in a mob. It used to make my heart jump every whirl, just as
if they had been fired up with a spring, and their swiftness of flight
was wonderful, but they never seemed to fly far. Sportsmen who
could shoot them on the wing were considered first-class shots in the
early days of muzzle-loaders.
The native Quail was very similar to the imported Australian
Quail in size and shape, only the New Zealanders were lighter in colour
and much more plump. I have read quite lately in a book of New
Zealand birds that it was through being slow fliers they had been shot
out, falling easy victims to shooters. It quite amused me, for whoever

is responsible for this statement could never have seen one in flight.
I noticed when they first introduced the Californian Quail in our district
our native Quail disappeared very quickly. I think they must have
been robbed of their natural food and starved out. The imported
Quail thrived so well that it was not long before you could see them in
big mobs. I have seen them from fifty to a hundred in big droves,
so what hope did our native birds have ?
The Owl, or Morepork, used to interest me a lot, and when I was
a school boy roaming about the bush near my home I used to see
lots of rat skins on the ground. I knew the Moreporks killed the
native bush rats [Maori Rat--there is no rat indigenous to New
Zealand. --Ed.] and ate them. The peculiar thing about these skins was
they were always turned inside out and with no flesh on them, and not
a sign of a break in the skin. One day our school master, who was just
out from Scotland, and a naturalist, asked if we had noticed the rat
skins, and I told him I had. He said it was a puzzle to naturalists
how the Moreporks turned the skin inside out without breaking the
skin (the head was always missing), and it is still a puzzle to me.
In my younger days I spent a lot of pleasant hours eel fishing
and Duck shooting along the lagoon and on the river-bed flats. On
still, moonlight nights, when waiting for Ducks, I have heard the weird
scream of some small animal up in the air and then a rat would come
falling through space with a Morepork following it. It would scarcely
hit the ground before the bird would have it again up in the
air and would keep at it until the rat was stunned or dead. Of course
the Morepork would not have a chance with a rat in the ordinary way,
but Nature supplies it with a light body, strong swift flight, and good
claws and beak, which gives it its power over its victim.
On very dark, calm nights when I have been eel fishing I used to
hear queer whispering noises, and wondered what they could be ; I
thought at the time it must be bush rats, but years after I found out the
noise was made by the courting Moreporks. Of course they did not
live entirely on rats and mice. I have seen one in the day time in the
dense shade of the bush with a Sparrow in its claws. What drew my
attention to it was the noise of a big mob of Sparrows all round it. I
do not think it bothers much about our small native birds, at least

I have never noticed it disturbing them. Perhaps Nature has provided
them with ways and means of keeping out of its way, and has made
the Owl the enemy of the rat, who in turn is the enemy of small birds.
There we have the balance of Nature again before the interference of
man. I have always thought, and still do, that the rats destroy a lot
of our native birds' nests and eat both the eggs and young.
I will now tell you a little about the famous Huia, now extinct
(or supposed to be), but I still think there is a chance of finding
isolated pairs along the Ruahine ranges in the high, rough
country. Between thirty-five and forty-five years ago I used
to roam about the bush a lot on the Ruahine ranges pig
hunting, chiefly between the Manawatu Gorge and Mount Wharata,
and used to use what is known as the old Napier track, a track
used in the early days by both Maori and White before the Gorge
road was made. It was on this track that I saw my first pair of Huias
climbing about the limbs of a big rata-tree on the summit, and that
was the time I learnt their call. It was a very dark day and threatening
to rain, and I noticed afterwards that when it was dull and rain was
near it was the time I mostly saw these birds. Of course they were
always in pairs, and if any were about you could hear them calling. I
would imitate them and it would not be long before they would come
down quite close to me, sometimes on to the ground. They were
quite tame if you kept still. I saw about six to eight pairs altogether.
Of course I am not sure, I might have come across the same pair at
different times. Along this track there were plenty of old dead forest
trees--probably killed by the fires used by the travellers along this
track. These dead trees provided the Huia with his natural food. I
have always got mixed up which was the male and female. One has
the long curved beak and the other a short beak, and they both are
dependent on each other and would die if separated it seems. It
must be the male bird with the long beak, which he drives into the holes
made by the hu hu in the dead trees and pulls out the grub, and
Nature has made it dependent on its mate. It cannot get the grub
into its mouth, and passes it to the other, who breaks it up and divides
it between them, having to put the other's share into its mouth. They
have a beautiful shaped body with slim, long, black legs, and they

look magnificent in the bush with their black plumage and long black
tail with a pure white band across the tip. The tail feathers were con-
sidered an honour by the Maoris, but only chiefs and men of high
caste were allowed to wear them. I must not forget its beautiful
orange wattles, which showed up well against the black plumage and
the light slaty coloured beak. I cannot tell you anything more about
it, but I can still give its whistle and call, and I hope this rare and lovable
bird will be found again and taken care of.
W. A. Rimmer,
Manawahe.
[The male Huia has the shorter, arched bill, that of the female
being slender, more strongly curved, and longer. The male, according
to Buller, uses his bill like a chisel, after the manner of Woodpeckers,
in order to obtain the grub in rotten timber, the female probing the
cells situated in the sound wood too hard for her mate to chisel off.
Occasionally she would extract the grub from a hole her
mate was enlarging if he with his shorter bill was unable to reach it,
but in each case she ate the victim herself. So it would seem that
Mr. Rimmer is mistaken in this matter. It would, however, be
interesting to know if he ever saw one feed the other.-- Ed.]

At the Primley Zoological Gardens were reared during 1933 three young
Black-throated Saltators ( Saltator atricollis), one Kuhl's Ground Thrush
(Geolcichla interpres ), and a brood of Indian Comb Ducks ( Sarkidiornis

these species appear to have been previously bred in Great Britain, though
there is a record of the last-mentioned in France.
Turquoisines (Neophema pulchella) have bred very successfully under

NOTES ON NEW ZEALAND BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988092666666667" page_id="56219503"  page_num="31" year="" vol="">
In regard to the letter of Mr. Alex. R. Strang in the December issue
of the Magazine, in which he refers to my description of the destruction of the
native forests as nonsense, I would ask Mr. Strang, or any one else interested
in the matter, to look up the maps issued by the New Zealand Government,
showing the areas of forest before the settlement of the country and the
areas existing at the present time, and possibly after perusing them they will
agree that my remarks are justified. I still maintain that outside of the
Government reserves the forest areas are infinitesimal compared to the
barren ones.
All the New Zealanders I spoke to agreed that the forest-burning in the
past had been both wanton and in many cases unjustifiable. In regard to
having no sense of proportion, I think that often a stranger sees things in
a better perspective than many of the inhabitants. One has only to read
the reports of the various societies for the protection of the native flora and
fauna in New Zealand to find that I only echo their sentiments. Why
has the Company referred to in Mr. Strang's letter purchased the 7,000
acres, except to destroy it ?
It is only by criticism that one helps to right defects or wrongs. Surely
one is tired of the type of person who visits a country and says " How
handsome your men are and how beautifully your women dress ". It is
much more helpful, but not quite so pleasant, if they point out some defect
in the drainage system !
I spoke to many eminent botanists and they all agreed that the New
Zealand forest can never be replanted and attain its former splendour.
I regret very much if I have given offence to my friends in New Zealand
by implying that the colonial farmer is a blackguard. This is far from the
truth; the ones I met proved to be most charming and hospitable, typical
only of the rest of New Zealanders I met.
Economic circumstances force us to do many things which in the eyes
of other people are wrong, and I do not blame the farmers for destroying
the forest, for every extra acre cleared means more pasturage for so many
more sheep and cows and a few more shillings in the farmer's pocket. But
does the economic struggle justify the destruction and extermination of all
natural products, whether they be kauri trees, Egrets, Birds of Paradise,
sables, whales, or such like products of Nature, which have been made the
object of commercial exploitation ? It is not the fault of the farmer but of
the social system.
All I can say is, that after spending nearly six months travelling about
over many parts of New Zealand my chief impression was of the absence of
native vegetation compared to the amount of " exotics ", and of the wanton
and unnecessary destruction of the forests, especially on the mountain ranges.
I suppose that, owing to my observations being so misleading, Mr. Strang
would have us believe that the native birds are plentiful as well, that the
native Robin visits the door-steps of the farmhouses for crumbs, that the
Saddlebacks and the native Thrushes sing on the orchard boughs, and the
Huia and the Stitch-bird can be heard on every hand, and the Moa is still
to be found in the recesses of the vast tracts of forest !

BREEDING OF THE LAMMERGEYER IN CONFINEMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972935192307692" page_id="56219504"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
Mr. Hampe's record (1933, p. 459) of the breeding of the Condor in the
Berlin Zoo is most interesting, and inspires me to put more on record as to
the breeding of another big bird of prey, the Lammergeyer (Gypaetus
barbatus ), than I was able to do in the note which appeared on p. 84 of
last year's volume.
This merely mentioned that Lammergeyers had been bred at Sofia
for many years. The further details I can now give are taken from the
German Zoological Journal, Der Zoologische Garten , New Series, Band i,
July, 1928, pp. 32-57, in an article by Dr. Schumann, of the Zoological
Gardens, Sofia, Bulgaria, and for my knowledge of them I am indebted to
Mr. Grunzig, of Avenel, New Jersey, U.S.A., who has kindly sent me a
translation of these essential parts of the account, which I give here :--
" A writer in the Zoologische Beobachter for 1916 described the first
successful rearing of the Lammergeyer in the Sofia Zoo. Since then the
pair have bred regularly and raised their offspring every year ; altogether
up to 1926-7 eight young Lammergeyers were reared and only one failure
recorded. Two eggs were the regular clutch, except in 1928, when only one
was laid, and generally the first was laid about 9th January, the second
about the 13th. The female sits most eagerly . . . only leaving the nest to
feed in the mornings. She begins to sit as soon as the first egg is laid and the
incubation period lasts fifty-five to fifty-six days. . . . The second nestling
to hatch (? the weaker) was killed by the parents in every case. . . . The
success was achieved in an aviary 6 metres long, 7 deep, and 8 high. In
March, 1929, there were eleven offspring of the original pair living at the
Sofia Zoo."

MR. C. T. METZGER
It is with sincere regret that we have to record the death, which
took place on 28th October, 1933, of Mr. Metzger, of Chicago, a member
of this Society since 1923, but better known as the energetic founder
and editor of our American contemporary, Aviculture.
Mr. Karl Plath writes :--" Our own Society here, which has
functioned so haphazardly during the illness of the editor, Mr. C. T.
Metzger, has suffered a severe loss in his death. He did much to
bring the Society to its prominence and, until his illness early in the
year, gave practically all of his time to it. We have not given up,
however, and hope to come back bigger and better. In the meantime,
much luck to your Society ; it is one of the few of the many things
I belong to that I thoroughly enjoy."

NOTES FROM A CHICAGO AVIARY
By Karl Plath
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.964589" page_id="56219513"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Now that cold weather is at hand one has a greater ambition to write
about the happenings in the aviary during the past season, though
naturally the interesting events occur during the warm summer months
when the birds are all in their outside home. All of my birds are now in
the winter aviary which is partitioned off from my studio on the top
floor of my home with glass and wire. This forms a room 9 X 12 X
8J feet high, and is perhaps half the size of the summer cage. To the
left along the entire side is a ledge made of artificial rock and extending
up the wall is a rocky formation down which water trickles into a
shallow pool. Numerous branches are arranged in a natural effect
and sprays of arbor-vitse impart a pleasing green effect that lasts for
months. The floor is covered with about 2 inches of coarse sand
which is sifted once a week or oftener if necessary. The seed is placed
in a home-made hopper of glass so that it is readily noticed when it
needs replenishing. As the supply of seed lasts from four to six weeks,
having it in this hopper does relieve from the daily feeding. As both
fresh water and seed are taken care of the only feeding necessary
is the soft-food mixture prepared every morning and which consists of
apple, banana, and grapes chopped up and mixed with the staple
Mocking-bird food, to which ant-eggs and dried insects are added. A

Karl Plath--Notes from a Chicago Aviary
separate dish has a small quantity of scalded chopped heart and chopped
hard-boiled egg. This is primarily for the few shore birds I have, though
all of the birds take some of the egg.
I have often wondered why there are not more people interested
in aviculture in this large city of nearly four million inhabitants yet
except for a few estates in the adjoining suburbs which may have a
few Pheasants or Ducks or Peafowl no one seems to go in for the
keeping of birds. Of course, there are single cages of birds but the
rarities are the exception. In all the years of my keeping birds and
the several years of my interest in the American Avicultural Society
I have only known of one other person having more than, say, twenty
birds, and he was the late Mr. Metzger, who so unselfishly gave of
his time and funds to further the interests of the magazine Aviculture
of which he was the editor.
To return to my own inside aviary. It is so arranged that it serves
as an acclimatizing station, for the large window about 5 feet square
opens out on to an outside extension where the birds may enjoy the
warmth of the day and yet have protection from the sudden chills
of night. So that by the time they are ready to be put downstairs in
the garden aviary or after they are brought up to their winter quarters
they are quite well accustomed to the change.
Concealed in the wall are two 100-watt lamps so that on dark days
or in the evening there is an abundance of light. As I write in my studio
I have an unobstructed view of the aviary and it does not need much
imagination to fancy oneself many miles away in a sunny outdoor
region. Perhaps the most gorgeous of all the birds and the ones which
immediately intrude on one's consciousness are the gorgeous Fairy
Bluebirds (Irena turcosa). I have a true pair and the male has the upper
parts a most beautiful shade of cerulean blue which in certain fights
changes to turquoise. These upper feathers are highly polished and
gleam and flash with every movement. They are in startling contrast
to the velvety jet black of the lower parts and sides of the head in
which the ruby-coloured eye is set off beautifully. The female is slightly
smaller and in colour reminds me of a gigantic Indigo Bunting though
the colour is a bit duller. When the birds sit side by side her colour
inclines to greenish blue. She is also a handsome bird and if she were

seen alone would be quite beautiful. It was possible for me to acquire
these exquisite birds through the generosity of Mr. E. H. Lewis, super-
intendent of the Catalina Island Aviaries in California. On a recent
visit to Chicago he made the remark that my Bluebirds were in
better plumage than his owing to the fact that his had to be kept
indoors for show purposes all the year round. The Fairy Bluebirds
have been happy all summer long in the outside aviary and I hope
they will continue to do well in their winter quarters. They sit more
or less upright with the tail pointed down and are usually quiet. The
note most often heard is a sharp, whistled " whit-whit (I have
just seen Lord Tavistock's article on his Fairy Bluebirds and his
description of the note is " kwit-kwit ", which is just as accurate a
description.) Their food seems to be mainly fruit mixed with the
Mocking-bird food. They have never taken a mealworm but I have seen
them fly to the ground to pick up a cricket or moth. Owing to the short
legs they do not appear to be at home on a flat surface. I have heard--
and seen--the female warble a subdued song that was rather pleasing,
but the male so far has not shown any musical ability.
Another favourite bird--kept in a separate cage for obvious reasons
--is a Cissa or Hunting Crow (Cissa chinensis). When I received this
bird in July it was a lovely shade of green, especially on the head and
breast, where it reminded me much of the peculiar tint of the Luna
moth's wing. The jet black band on the head and the mahogany
brown of the wings, together with the vermilion beak and legs composed
a colour scheme that was very fascinating. In certain lights the wings
showed crimson lights. I had to go out of town for several days and
just before it was time to leave, my neighbour called me and said
that my " Crow " was out. I found him on the roof and then--gone.
As I had exchanged three of my rarer birds for him and planned to use
him in a special painting I had to carry this frustration away with me.
But before leaving I took time to sketch the bird in colour in two letters
I sent out to friends in public museums. Whenever a peculiar bird
turns up it is immediately reported to them so that if my Cissa ever
was captured I knew they would hear about it. On the day of my return,
in fact it was just an hour before, one of my friends telephoned and
reported that my bird was located.

Karl Plath--Notes from a Chicago Aviary
A lady who lectures reported seeing it at the Municipal Tuberculosis
Sanatorium about a mile from my home. It seemed to be poorly cared
for, she said, and thought something should be done about it. She
was shown my letter with the sketch and identified it as the bird she
had seen. Of course, I went over as soon as I could and got my Cissa but
his green colour was gone and he was now a pale turquoise and very
thin. Aside from my great luck in regaining the bird is the interesting
incident that later it transpired that only three of these birds were
imported to this country and these three went to three men acquainted
with each other but who had acquired them without the others knowing
it. They were Mr. Crandall, curator of birds of the New York Zoo ;
Mr. Maresi, Secretary of the Avicultural Society of America ; and
myself.
After a heavy moult in August, during which the black feathers
surrounding the eye and on the sides of the head came completely
out, the bird is now in full plumage. At times when it is excited there
is a curious formation of long eyelash-like feathers above the eye which
remind one ridiculously of one of our Hollywood movie stars with
exaggerated eyelashes ! The original green tint is slowly coming back,
especially on the head and silky crest and on the tail. The forehead
is now yellowish green. It is truly one of the loveliest of the Jays or
Magpies, whichever family it belongs to. No bird in my collection is
so vivacious in movement, and its calls are loud and varied. It also
warbles a subdued little song quite melodious were it not interspersed
with a harsh note now and then. This song is much like the one the
Magpie sometimes sings. In summer he has a roomy cage outside,
but in winter is kept in a box cage 3 by 3 feet and 20 inches
deep. He is allowed a flying period each day in the studio and there
takes his bath and when he is ready, sooner or later, goes back to his
cage. He is extremely fond of mice and sparrows, and usually gets
one or the other every day. His food also consists of chopped raw meat,
grated carrots, fruit, insects, etc. I am hoping that a continuance of
this diet will restore his original hue completely. He always selects
a dark corner and seems to avoid the sun.
The smaller waders were always favourites of mine and I have had
Rails and a Turnstone for years. Last year I bought two male Ruffs,

which are attractive additions to the aviary, and I consider them
desirable birds for any aviary having a small pool. One of them has
a snowy white ruff while in the other it is of an orange tan hue. At
present they are in the plain plumage of winter. They often spar with
one another but seem to be absolutely inoffensive with the other birds.
For many years I have wanted to get a Stilt, and though several were
promised to me, whether from Texas, Florida, or Cuba--even South
America--I was so often disappointed that I gave up the idea of ever
having one. Then I secured a copy of Game-birds and Water-fowl in
Captivity and read there that small waders had been successfully
raised from eggs hatched in captivity. I had heard about this time of
a gentleman living in Utah who could procure for me eggs of the Black-
necked Stilt. He kindly sent me two sets of four each which I set under
a Japanese Silky Bantam. After twenty-five days one hatched but in
some manner was crushed under the Bantam. None of the others
hatched. A second lot was placed in an incubator and after twenty-five
days one hatched and no more. The young bird was quite active, running
about with many of the characteristics of the adult, but it too only lived
a short time and by then I was pretty much discouraged. But my
friend said that if I wished he could get some half-fledged young if I
wanted them. If 1 wanted them ! Had I known that I could have young
birds I would not have bothered with the eggs. At any rate he sent
me three young Stilts, about four weeks old, and they arrived in fine
condition after a 1,000 mile journey. They were beautiful creatures,
snowy white and sooty black, all of the upper feathers being edged
with bright buff. The legs were pale grey blue. Now they are four
months old and the buff edgings are rapidly disappearing, the legs
are longer and becoming pink, and the eyes, too, are changing to red.
They are dainty birds and I have been so attracted by their elegant
actions and proportions that the other shorter-legged shore birds seem
poorly shaped. They have been, so far, inoffensive, are not dirty,
and, except for some rather shrill " good-night " notes, are quiet.
I am very fond of them and hope they will continue to do well. During
the summer a young friend of mine kept me supplied with fresh ant-
pupae and water-insects which were dumped into the shallow pool
and what a time they had catching them. Quite dexterous. They

Karl Plath--Notes from a Chicago Aviary
frequently stand in the water up to their bellies and enjoy bathing,
as do all the other shore birds, with a comical tip-up motion. Like
all the other birds of this class, they often doze standing on one leg.
Suddenly awakening, they seem to forget that they have two legs and
go hopping off on one for some distance.
At one time I had a beautiful Cuban Trogon which lived well for
over four years then suddenly dropped dead. It was a harmless creature
and very tame. I tried for years to get another then had the oppor-
tunity to get two. These were even more beautiful as the red under parts
were exceptionally rich and deep in tone. Then suddenly we began
to find a small bird dead occasionally and more or less mangled. It
was very mysterious and there was no clue to the culprit. One day
one of the Trogons was seen with a Wren Tit in its bill but dropped it
as soon as it saw that it was observed. But I did not suspect the Trogon
as being the killer until one day it was seen with my prize beauty of
the small birds, an exquisite American Redstart, not only holding it
in its beak but savagely beating it up and down on a rock. This was
enough, and though I had not seen any of this misbehaviour both
Trogons were removed. To the average person both were alike, but I
was able to distinguish between them and had I seen the affair would
have known which was the guilty one. But to be on the safe side
I took them out and later sent them to the Catalina Island Bird Park.
I think this aberration of conduct is unusual in the Trogons and
Mr. Crandall, of the New York Zoological Society, says they have never
had any trouble in their molesting other birds. It is my thought that
the bird confused the small birds with butterflies and would seize them
as they fluttered near. I regretted very much having to give them up
as they were very difficult to obtain and it may have been that one of
them had not caused any harm.
For years I have had a pair of Red-crested Finches (Coryphospingus
cristatus) but the male had a crippled foot and though the female
frequently laid nothing ever came of it. I also had a male Pileated
Finch ( Coryphospingus pileatus), and when later the male Red-crested
Finch died the female mated with the Pileated. Several times eggs
were laid and hatched but the young always disappeared after a day
or two. So I took one of the small wicker travelling cages and fastened

it to the side of the aviary, and then arranged the opening so that it
could be closed without too much disturbance. It was not long before
the female again built a nest and laid three eggs, and when I saw that
they were hatched I closed up the nesting-box so that she could not
fly into the aviary and opened the other side so that she could be
at liberty in the garden. She was all over the neighbourhood and even
the neighbours, who did not know much about our native birds, wondered
about the fearless little reddish-brown bird that came so familiarly
to their gardens. One day I found that one of the youngsters had
fluttered out, so when I had the opportunity closed up the nesting-cage
and removed the mother and her offspring to a large cage. One morning
I found that she was gone--how I never found out. I tried putting the
male parent in with the young, but he was concerned only with his
own food and one by one they died. Had I had the time I would have
tried hand-feeding, but just at that time I was unable to give them proper
attention. The youngsters were quite strong and of a dusky brown
colour.
It may be that some of the readers would be interested in knowing
how these photographs were secured. Most people think that birds
in an aviary would be easy to photograph. It is so with the exceptionally
tame ones but just the opposite with those that are timid. After much
wasting of film my neighbour, Ralph Fallert, an expert in almost all
lines of photography but to whom bird-photography was an
unconquered field, devised a special box for the purpose. It is
a frame 20 X 20 X 30 inches long and is covered with celluloid
more from convenience in handling than any other reason. The further
end is of plain wood on which the branch is fastened and the opposite
end is of screen with an opening admitting the camera. While it may
not be exactly ' 4 sporting " to photograph birds in this manner my
contention is that for illustrative purposes bird-photographs cannot
show too much detail.
I am giving here a list of the birds now or recently living in my
aviary. To keep our native birds one must have the proper credentials
and both Federal and State permits. Many of our native birds are as
fascinating as any exotic foreigner and I have quite^a number.

BREEDING THE STRIATED FINCH OR
WHITE-BACKED MUNIA (Uroloncha striata)
IN INDIA
By Godfrey Davis
I am at present debarred by circumstances from having aviaries,
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.993606428571428" page_id="56219523"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
either movable or fixed ; and I have come across few cages which I
have really liked ; one was a triple breeding cage of French manu-
facture which I bought in Guernsey and in which I bred the little
Red Avadavat and then, as the cage was made for Canaries, I had
to make two doors at the end on which to hang the nesting-boxes.
But these French cages, nice as they were, were not made to hang
nesting-boxes on nor to be moved in and out from the verandah to
the garden, for I believe in keeping birds as far as possible in the open
air, and that means in India only in the morning and evening sun.
So I thought I would design a cage of wood and wire netting because
it is another of my ideas that cages must be cheap if the little ornamental
Finches are to be domesticated like the Canary. As a matter of fact
the cage when made was not cheap, but that was because it was made
by a Sikh carpenter out of teak wood, with joints as skilfully and

<bodyText confidence="0.966676388888889" page_id="56219524"  page_num="42" year="" vol="">
carefully made as if it were a fine bit of furniture. But, of course, the
cage need not be of teak wood or joiner-made and teak wood is a
disadvantage as it is so heavy, and one essential quality of this cage
is that it should be light, so that it can easily be moved from the
verandah into the garden and back again. It can be made of pine and
" rough carpentry ", the woodwork protected with solignum or creosote.
The cage I designed, then, was merely a wooden framework, 30 in.
long and 20 in. wide and 20 in. high. The uprights were 1 in. square,
the cross-pieces 1 X f in., and the door frames 1 in. deep and f in.
wide. The legs of the cage were 1J in. long. One of the ideas in this
cage was to be in the roof. The nesting-box, I thought, ought to be
inside the cage because of rats and other things, and it ought to be
possible to put the nesting-box in and take it out without a struggle.
I am not particularly troubled about birds escaping because I have
always found that small birds like Munias come back and wait to be
" let in So the roof was made, not flat, but with a gable to its apex
9 in. high, and one side of the roof lifted up : in fact one side of the
roof consisted of three doors hinged from the ridge. Each of the three
doors was in fact 9J in. wide and 11J in. high measured along the
slope, but that was only because my Sikh carpenter made each door
the same width as the others and fitted the three perfectly into the
side of the sloping roof. In fact I do not think three doors in the roof
are necessary. I should in future have only two doors ; one 10 in.
wide at one end through which I would put in and take out the nesting-
box and the other door I should make to fill up the rest of the opening ;
but I would have all one side of the roof to open so that all parts of
the cage could be thoroughly washed and scoured. Also in the past
I had found it difficult to put in bunches of seeding grass or really
good-sized earthenware saucers for the birds to bathe in, so I decided
the doors should be large. Therefore, one end of the cage I made all
doors ; two at the bottom-half which lifted up, hinged from the wooden
cross-bar fixed half-way up the side, so that if necessary both doors
could be lifted open at once and bundles of seeding grass could be
pushed in ; and two doors at the top half, but these were hinged on
the uprights of the framework so as to open outwards, and these doors
were to allow the birds to pass from one cage to another. As a mafter

of fact these two doors were the only weak spots in my model cage
because they will not bend backwards, and unless a cage is made to
fit in exactly in the space left when they are opened, there is trouble.
I should get over this difficulty in a future model by having hinges
which would allow the doors to be lifted off ; there will then be no
opening outward doors to prevent another cage from being brought
close alongside. All the doors were fastened by small wooden buttons.
The frame of the cage and of the doors were covered with  |in. wire
netting. In fact I have found this not so satisfactory as \ in. mesh
which I had fixed on a second of the cages I had made. The f in. mesh
wire netting is heavy and the very small mesh rather obscures the view.
The bottom of the cage also was covered with wire netting, and a tray
of thin galvanized sheet iron nailed on to a wooden frame slid in and
out over the wire netting ; the tray actually slid upon a thin guiding
rail of wood let into the centre of the bottom framework, lengthwise
from beneath, thus guiding and supporting the tray ; a wood flap
hinged by wire on to the first bottom cross-bar lifted up so as to allow
the tray to be put in and taken out. The tray pulled out beneath the
doors from the end farthest from the nesting-box and so caused as
little disturbance as possible. The cage stood on the floor of the
verandah, end-on against the wall, so that the doors at the end could
be lifted without undue disturbance or movement when food or water
was to be supplied. The verandah measured 10 by 22 ft. and opened
into the garden. In fact the birds became so tame that food could
be put in at any of the doors and the little hen seemed to wait till you
were looking to go in and feed the young. The nesting-box was made
of thin white wood ; it was 6 in. square on three sides with a piece of
stout wire passed through two holes in the back and twisted into
a hook to hang on to the wire netting ; the front of the nesting-box
was half-open, the lower half being closed with a 3 in. strip of wood.
As a matter of fact in the cage in which the Munias nested I had two
nesting-boxes, and it turned out this was an advantage, because after
the young left the nest it would seek shelter from the sun in the empty
nesting-box, and both the cock and the hen would go inside the box to
feed it, but it returned to the box in which was the nest at night and
at midday when the cage was brought in from the garden. I am afraid

the description of this cage is long and tedious and much of it may
be unnecessary if the photos I have sent to our Editor are fit for
reproduction. 1 Perches were merely thin branches pushed into the
wire netting but thick enough at one end to fill the mesh.
I had occasionally seen some black and white Munias in the bird
market in Crawford Market in Bombay, and when I knew I was going
to be for some months in one bungalow during the rains in the Deccan
1 asked Hussain, the " bird merchant ", as he calls himself, to get me
two pairs and a few pairs of Bengalese. The Munias were to supply
the eggs and the Bengalese were to hatch them and feed the young.
Hussain, with his usual generous interpretation of my orders, arrived
in due course with two pairs of Munias, three pairs of Bengalese, two
pairs of Green Avadavats, and three pairs of Silverbills. The black and
white Munias are, in fact. White-backed Munias and Silverbills are
White-throated Munias. The White-backed Munias are more southern
birds, hence their dark, rich plumage ; the Silverbills are more northern
birds, inhabitants of sandy tracts of country, hence their pale fawn
plumage. I had a few spare cages but not sufficient for this little flock,
so I got my Sikh carpenter to make me a flight cage, 4 ft. long by
2 ft. wide by 3 ft. high to the ridge, on the same pattern as the cage
he had made before, and in this I put my spare Bengalese and the
Silverbills. In case they should be inclined to breed I hung on the wire
netting six nesting-boxes until the cage looked like a miniature dovecot,
but when the Bengalese and Silverbills got into condition, they fought
and so interfered with each other that successful breeding was
impossible. My experience has been that no more than one pair of
small birds, if in breeding condition, can be kept without fighting in
one large cage, but the experience of others may differ. I had another
cage of the pattern I have first described, and which I think may fairly
be called a " breeding pen ", made for a pair of Bengalese, while the
two pairs of Green Avadavats and one pair of White-backed Munias
were put into separate cages, oblong wire cages measuring 24 in. long
by 14 in. high by 14 in. wide, but though I hung nesting-boxes on
the ends of these cages, it was only in the " breeding pen " that eggs
were hatched and young reared. The pair of White-backed Munias

in the oblong wire cage did, in fact, build a nest and the hen laid eggs
but the birds did not seem to have the feeling of confidence and security
that the " breeding pen " seemed to give. I ascribe the increasing
confidence and tameness of the Munias in the " breeding pen " to its
size and to the gabled roof which, with the cross-pieces, seemed to
give the birds confidence and a feeling of security. The cock and the
hen in the smaller oblong cage both rushed into the nest when any-
one passed the cage or stopped to look at them and the young, though
hatched, survived only a few days. The Green Avadavats merely played
about with grass, the cock birds fixing it at the entrance of the nesting-
box so that it always fell down. Contrary to my previous experience
the Green Avadavats did not appear to want to build in the box, but
outside it. I planted seed of Indian millet to get half-ripe growing seed
heads for the parent birds to rear their young on, but unfortunately
excessive rains and grasshoppers destroyed the crop and I had to rely
largely on soaked seeds. It is to this that I attribute, perhaps wrongly,
the fact that I only reared one out of the three young Munias. About
the end of August the pair of White-backed Munias in the breeding pen
got really busy. The cock bird took the seeding grass I gave it and
carried it into the nesting-box ; the hen sat contentedly inside but the
cock kept reaching to his full height, pushing the grass up and then
drawing it over to form the domed roof and covered entrance to the
nest. I think I must have put too much dried grass in the nesting-
boxes to form the foundation and side supports of the nest because
Munias build large nests and even in the case of the Bengalese, which
I was keeping for foster-parents, one of the four young which left the
nest seemed cramped : at least he had practically no tail. In future
I should put only a thin lining of dried grass into the nesting-box. About
12th September I took the Munias nesting-box out to see if there were
eggs, as on the 9th the Bengalese had four eggs. There were four eggs.
The Munias seemed to have become even tamer than the Bengalese,
though wild-caught only early the same year, and the cock always care-
fully pulled back any grass in the front of the nest which I had dis-
arranged. I did not take the nesting-box out again until all the four
Bengalese eggs were hatched and then I found one little Munia and
three eggs. But the next morning the young Munia was dead in the

seed jar. The three eggs did not hatch till the next day but thereafter
none of the young was thrown from the nest. The eggs were white,
like the eggs of Bengalese, but more pointed.
I did not attempt to use the Bengalese as foster-parents because
no parents could have been more attentive than the Munias, but un-
fortunately by the end of September seeding grass was difficult to find;
my crop of Indian millet had been destroyed and I was forced to rely
on soaked seed. To this I attributed the slow growth of the Munias
and Bengalese, because according to my calculation neither the
Bengalese nor the Munias left the nest till thirty days after hatching.
When they did so, one Bengalese was a very feeble little thing ; one
other was small; two others only were strong and well developed,
and the little White-backed Munia, though exceedingly lively and
alert, had no feathers on its head and neck. It looked like a miniature
vulture. One of my servants from Goa, however, assured me that
young Munias often left the nest in this state; he said he had seen many
of them wild, as they are common in the rice-growing tracts of Goa
whence he comes and, indeed, the flight feathers of the little Munia
were very well developed, his tail was quite perceptible, his little legs
were strong, only his head and neck were bare. I know some favour
soaked seed ; others say it is nasty, smelly stuff. In the morning I
used to fill a cup half-full of seed, Indian millet, and fill the cup with
water ; in the evening I used to pour off the foul water and fill with
fresh water and pour out and refill with water again six or seven times,
thus thoroughly washing the seed ; this I, or rather my servant, used
to do again on the morning and evening of the second day, and on the
morning of the third day the seed was just sprouting and clean. It
was then poured out of the cup and dried in a bit of muslin. It was
a lot of trouble and did not seem to me to take the place of half-ripe
growing seed.
Two of the young Munias died when they were just feathering ;
whether it was the soaked seed or that I had cramped the nest by
placing too much dry grass inside I do not know. I thought I must
do something to change the diet. Two young Munias had died and the
growth of the others and of the young Bengalese appeared very slow.
Vitamins, that blessed word, was what they probably wanted, and

A and D, the vitamins of growth. The only thing I could think of were
the ripening heads of bajri or the lesser millet, which was growing in
the fields. Bajri, when ripe, is a little hard, grey-green seed, much
liked by the Grey Partridge, and the seed is ground up fine between
two stones and fed to the young Partridges, which the Indians are so
fond of rearing, and this, with white ants, seems to rear them well.
But Munia and other small birds cannot or will not eat this seed when
ripe and hard but apparently they are very fond of it when it is half-
ripe. I got some half-ripe bajri heads and stripped off the seeds, which
are closely embedded in the head. I found I could get the half-ripe
seeds from the head by stripping the head downwards towards the
stalk and I gave the small, soft half-ripe seeds to the Munias and
Bengalese. They took them greedily at once and thereafter scarcely
ever touched the Indian millet, soaked or dry. I had tried paddy or
unhusked rice, as Munias, when wild, are supposed to feed largely on
this, but while they may feed on the half-ripe heads I found they took
very little of the hard and ripe paddy.
The little Munia had left the nest before I had thought of the half-
ripe bajri, but after I had started to feed it on bajri the feathers on the
head started to grow and in a week its head was covered with black
quills, and clearly the feathers on the head are going to be the same
colour as the parents, or velvety black ; the flight feathers of the young
bird and the tail feathers are like the parents, or velvety black, but
where the parent birds are white the young bird is ashy grey, tinged
with brown. There are no striations on the neck and back, as with
the parent birds, but instead of the fine fight-brown striations there
are some fight-brown spots. When the little Munia came from the
nest it had a conspicuous white spot at each corner of the mouth and
when it opened its beak to be fed, its mouth was a bright greenish
white. This apparently is to guide the parents when they feed it in
the dark recesses of the nest. I do not know if White-backed Munias
have been bred in cage or aviary before, but from my experience I
should say they are most suitable little birds for aviculture. They
quickly get tame and confiding : when noticed the cock used to spread
out his tail fanwise and commence to " sing " ; the contrasting black
and white plumage is very effective, suggesting to me a Japanese

coloured print, and if half-ripe growing seed is available and a sufficiently
large nest-box is given, I should say these little birds could be bred
without difficulty. I have found the breeding pen I have described
quite large enough, though if I were breeding Grass Finches or
St. Helena Waxbills I think I should make the cage 40 inches long.
In Ahmedabad I grew for my St. Helena Waxbills a seed called
" Cheena ", which appeared to me to be yellow millet, and they preferred
it to the Indian millet I grew. Munias undoubtedly like the half-ripe
seeding heads of Indian millet, because when I gave my Munias a few
seeding heads that had sprouted in the garden, they left the half-
ripe bajri seeds at once for these. Anyhow these little White-backed
Munias made model and devoted parents ; their partial failure was
not due to them.
A word on Purple Sunbirds. We found an injured Purple Sunbird
lying on the drive in front of the bungalow. It seemed to have been
injured in the spine. It could only drag itself along. We put it in a
small cage and gave it Horlick's and honey, and gradually it recovered
to the extent that it could stand on a perch and just fly from one
perch to another. I found one heaped teaspoonful of Horlick's and
one level teaspoonful of brown sugar dissolved in a breakfast cup of
hot water better than the thicker mixture with honey ; at least, it
seemed better, for the stronger mixture seemed to lead to foot trouble
and after I had changed the food the foot trouble ceased. It has kept
the real yellow breast the Purple Sunbird has when wild and in eclipse
plumage, though in England I have found this yellow, which is a real
canary yellow, " jonque " and not " buff ", fade almost to grey, but
I have noticed in wild Sunbirds the yellow varies, being deepest and
brightest in colour in the rains when it is hot and damp.
I have also found that the white Indian jasmine is a very favourite
feeding flower of Sunbirds, so that Sunbirds in England could be given
the winter jasmine. I should imagine Sunbirds would also greatly
favour Honeysuckle. I have also found that Lotens, Vigors Yellow
Back, and the Purple Sunbird will eat any spider that is not too big
lor them to swallow ; and it is surprising the biggish spiders they will
seize and beat on the perch, as a Kingfisher beats a fish. Also Sunbirds
deserve their name. They are birds of the Sun and I have found my

In spite of the glorious summer of 1933, with its long hot days and
wonderful sunshine average, the breeding results here at the Keston
Foreign Bird Farm have not been noticeably better than usual among
the Parrakeets, while some of the Finch results were definitely dis-
appointing.
The following is a list of birds which reared young ones successfully

Our old breeding pair of Brown's, who have regularly produced
seven and sometimes more young in one season, hatched and reared
only two in the first nest this year, the remaining three chicks being dead
in the shell. While in their second nest they hatched four out of five
all of which they allowed to die when about one week old. At the time
this happened the weather was stiflingly hot and thundery. In fact,
just about the day they must have died, our house narrowly escaped
being struck by lightning, though whether this had anything to do
with the death of the young Brown's it is naturally quite impossible
to say. It is curious, however, that never before has this particular pair
of birds failed to rear every single one hatched.
Stanley's did quite well, one hen with a dropped wing producing,

much to our astonishment, a most beautiful family in spite of the
fact that from her general decrepit appearance she seemed anything
but promising as a stock bird. The same thing happened with a pair
of Rosellas, of which the cock was a fine and extremely healthy aviary-
bred specimen and his wife an obviously aged bird with an overgrown
beak. Having been caged for many years, she was somewhat alarmed
at the sight of a nest-box, and even when her young husband eventually
induced her by force to enter it, she showed how out of practice she
was by laying as her first egg a curious-looking object with a waist,
shaped like an hour-glass ! Her subsequent efforts were more normal,
and it is to her credit that she finally reared two fine youngsters.
Barrabands did well, though one infanticidal cock tried, as usual,
to murder the first of his family of five to emerge from the nest. He
has to be most carefully watched, and the moment the first young one
appears he is put into a small adjoining aviary, where his wife can see
him but where he, much to his disgust, is forced to contemplate his
growing family without being able to tear them to pieces. Luckily,
such behaviour in a Barraband is entirely abnormal.
Many-colours did very well and one young hen in a brood of four
has moulted out with nearly as much red on the lower breast as a
cock. She is being kept for experimental purposes. Two of our
pairs alone reared ten between them.
Early in the year one of our hen Hooded Parrakeets was mated
to a cock Bed-rump, the result being a brood of four hybrids. As far
as we are aware, this cross has only once been obtained before, in the
case of Lord Tavistock, but the young ones died almost immediately
on leaving the nest. It was amusing to see the hen Hooded's out-
raged astonishment on being expected to nest in the spring, when no
self-respecting Hooded dreams of setting up house until September
at the earliest ! One hopes that if another year she can be provided
with a mate of her own species, she will be able to persuade him of
the many advantages to be enjoyed by children who leave the nest
in June instead of December. The three young cock hybrids are at
present somewhat like a Red-rump to look at, but they are getting
red patches on the wings, orange feathers round the vent, and a greyish
back and hood. The latter, of course, may eventually go jet black.

for it must be remembered that immature Hooded take far longer
than tbe young Red-rumps to assume full adult plumage. They are
wonderful mimics of their neighbours and, like most mongrels and
hybrids, extremely lively and intelligent.
Ring-necks bred successfully, a particularly fine pair going to
nest almost immediately on arrival here, and rearing three young
ones. Young Cockatiels also left the nest after one false start.
Of the Grass Parrakeets, Turquoisines, Elegants, Bourke's, and
Blue-wings were all reared, though the two former did less well than
usual, for various more or less unpreventable reasons, such as a hen
refusing to sit, or young ones dying in the shell just as they were due to
hatch (as in the case of all but one of a brood of Elegants), or a
particularly prolific hen dying while incubating her second clutch.
On the other hand, nine young Bourke's were reared from two pairs,
and the same number of young from a single pair of Blue-wings, this
being, we imagine, a record number in one year from a single pair of
this species.
The arrival--too late to breed--must be recorded of a pair of the
excessively rare and beautiful little Splendid Parrakeet. Probably
very few aviculturists have ever seen this species alive, but it is
worth going a long way to see. The hen is not unlike a hen Turquoisine,
but the cock is far and away the most beautiful of all the Grass Parra-
keets, with his blue mask shading to an almost sapphire colour, in
striking contrast with the rich cherry-red of his breast. Incidentally,
this red breast-patch is much more extensive than it was usually
represented to be in the old coloured plates, nor are they correct in
portraying it as an almost completely circular, hard-edged blob of
colour. Actually, the two colours are merged into each other, by small
oblong red spots, which rapidly dwindle in size as they overlap into
the yellow of the lower breast.
Perhaps the most remarkable thing of all about the Splendid,
certainly the one that most strikes anyone who has kept other members
of the Grass Parrakeet tribe, is the extraordinary unlikeness of his
voice to that of other members of his family. In appearance he is so
much like a tremendously glorified edition of a Turquoisine, that
one instinctively expects him to utter but a slight variation of the

latter's bat-like squeakings. One's astonishment, therefore, can be
imagined when his voice turns out to be low-pitched and not unlike the
quieter notes of a Many-colour, varied with rather plaintive piping calls
reminiscent of a Bullfinch.
So far as we have been able to observe, the Splendid's display is
very like that of a Bourke's. At any rate, he occasionally indulges in
the latter's short quick runs up the wire netting with shoulders forward
and wings slightly depressed.
Of other comparatively recent arrivals, by far the greatest rarity
is a pair of Yellow-fronted New Zealands, the cock being in many
ways the most attractive and intelligent little Parrakeet we have ever
possessed. The hen came early in the spring, and as there seemed not
the remotest prospect of getting her a proper mate, she was given
a cock Blue-wing to keep her company. The two quickly became very
attached to each other, and the New Zealand laid four eggs, all of
which proved to be infertile. On the unexpected arrival of a husband
of her own species, she was put in an aviary with him, but it was too
late, and she refused to lay again. One can only hope that with heat
they will come through the winter safely and perhaps breed next year.
Another rather interesting arrival is a true and very fine pair
of the Splendid or Golden-mantled Rosella. This rare and much more
brilliantly coloured relation of the common species is by no means
easy to obtain, and even when a so-called pair are offered, one can
usually take for granted that the cock alone is of the rarer race, and
it is, therefore, particularly satisfactory to have been able to obtain
a pair in which both sexes are genuine Golden-mantles.
Malabars did not breed, but the cock being newly imported was
unable to fly, and has been busy moulting most of the summer. Pennants
and Yellow-rumps were both too young to breed, as also was the hen
of a pair of Crimson-wings.
We wish we could say the Finches have done as well as the
Parrakeets. Unfortunately, this is not the case. They unquestionably
did worse than we have ever experienced before. Whether the extremely
hot summer or the loss, through illness, early in the year of several
of our old breeding pairs was the cause we cannot definitely say, but
the fact remains only about half the number of young birds were reared

from some of the species that we had anticipated, taking into considera-
tion onr previous years' averages.
The farm is situated, of course, in a very sheltered position, looking
due south, consequently from dawn to dusk the aviaries are bathed
in sunshine, and we noticed during the dreadfully hot days of summer
the Finches were inclined to come off their nests and leave the eggs
to look after themselves. The only species that did even moderately
well during July and August were the Bichenos. Of these a good many
youngsters were reared, and a cross between a double-banded Finch
(Black-rumped Bicheno) and a Binged Finch (White-rumped Bicheno)
seems to point to the fact that the Binged Finches are the dominant
species, as all the young had white rumps.
In previous notes we have said that these birds are rather difficult
to breed. After our experience this season we are inclined to think
this statement should be qualified. Provided one can obtain true pairs
(they are undoubtedly very difficult to sex) all they seem to us to
require is a " Keston " wire box, some clean grass and feathers with
which to construct their nest, and plenty of millet spray and flowering
grass when feeding young. We have never succeeded in getting them
to take any live food. The eggs are pure white and extremely small,
incubation takes fourteen days, and the young when they leave the
nest are grey. But the cocks usually have a faint sign of the black
band across the breast, and in consequence they could be sexed, we
believe, with greater certainty when young than later on when fully
adult.
All the Long-tailed Grass and Heck's Grass Finches had young in
May, and not again until September, October, and November. At
the time of writing (15th November) there are two nests, one of five
and the other of four, just fledged. All these youngsters are good birds,
and the latest we can remember rearing. No doubt they have been
considerably helped by the very mild autumn, but we shall be curious
to see if they are as large, when adult, as those hatched in the spring.
Zebra Finches did very moderately, our average dropping to
approximately six young per pair. We have, however, bred a practically
pure white hen at last.
Two of our best breeding Buficaudas died at the beginning of the

year, thereby considerably diminishing our prospects of a successful
season. Two other pairs refused to sit, but their eggs were transferred
to Bengalese, another pair had infertile eggs, another pair two success-
ful nests, and another pair one successful nest of three, the hen dying
when the young were about to fledge, but the brood was reared by the
cock alone.
Cherry Finches share with the Ruficaudas the doubtful distinction
of doing worse than anything else, and although a very small number
were reared, we regret to say our breeding stocks are now sadly depleted.
We greatly increased the numbers of pairs of Bengalese , at the
beginning of the year, but here again the hot weather seems to have
affected them adversely, a large number of the eggs being addled.
Diamond Doves, after a false start, finished up with a fair number of
young.
Four pairs of Red-headed Parrot Finches were very kindly brought
over for us by a friend who had paid a personal visit to the remote
island of New Caledonia, and the birds arrived here about the end of June.
They were all very healthy, but naturally in importation plumage, and
only one pair seemed at all unlikely to start an immediate moult. These
were given a fair-sized outdoor aviary to themselves, and we were
surprised and delighted when they promptly went to nest, laying, how-
ever, first of all a clutch of infertile eggs. After these were removed
the hen at once laid again and this time successfully hatched and reared
four young ones, which duly left the nest about 19th September. The
brood was reared largely on live food, although the parents were also
very keen on millet spray and green food, particularly bunches of
flowering rye grass, which at that time was, of course, very difficult
to find in any quantity.
Incidentally, having read that Parrot Finches were particularly
addicted to a straw hat for their nesting site, we purchased a " boater "
for them which was duly nailed to the wall, a hole being made towards
the top of the crown. This, however, they ignored, nesting instead
in an ordinary Budgerigar box.
The young ones were rather sombre little green birds when they
left the nest with straw-coloured lower mandible and a black upper
one, and a faint trace of red on the tail and forehead. They are gradually

changing, and now have quite a bright band of crimson round the base
of the upper mandible. This description is necessarily somewhat vague,
as Parrot Finches are so extraordinarily quick in their actions, seeming
indeed to indulge in almost perpetual motion, so much so that some
pairs are a little bit inclined to wear the feathers off the crown of their
heads by bumping against the wire top of their flight.
Unlike some of our other Finches, Gouldians have this year done
particularly well, quite a large number of youngsters being successfully
bred. Their most remarkable feat however, was the successful rearing
of thirteen young ones by two pairs, one pair rearing eight young in
a single nest and the other five. These two broods were both late,
leaving the nest about the third of November, and a small heating lamp
was put in the shelter of their aviary at night since they came out,
as an extra precaution against cold. Although we knew that one pair
had eight young ones, we hardly imagined that their overworked
parents would succeed in bringing up the whole family. They actually
managed this, however, and all were good youngsters with the exception
of one, which died two days after leaving the nest, being small and
corresponding, presumably, to the " darling " of a litter of pigs. One
pair only went to nest at a reasonable time, i.e. in the late spring, all
the rest persisting in the tiresome Gouldian habit bf beginning to think
about house-hunting at the end of July.
Last year only Peach-faced Lovebirds were reared. This year,
curiously enough, Nyasas, Fischer's, and Black-cheeks were all success-
fully reared, but no Peach-faced. This was mainly due to the fact that
we tried all our Lovebirds in a new type of aviary which did not seem
to suit the Peach-faces at all well. So much hybridizing, intentional
and unintentional, is done between the various Lovebirds that it is
none too easy to obtain pure-bred breeding stock, genuine Black-
cheeks being particularly hard to get.
Silverbills and Fire Finches were also bred and, of course, large
numbers of Budgerigars, in all colours, but we are particularly pleased
to be able to record the rearing of a number of young Buttercup
Budgerigars from the stock birds with which Mr. Seth-Smith expressed
himself so particularly struck on his last visit here, and which he also
mentioned in the September number of the Avicultural Magazine.

These birds are all a lovely rich pure yellow, without the faintest
tinge of green, even on the rump. We had the greatest difficulty in
building up the small original stock, as such birds are extremely difficult
to obtain, and the demand always exceeds the supply. Pure yellow
Budgerigars were, we believe, fairly abundant, even before the War,
and certainly before the advent of all the other various coloured
varieties which, presumably, overshadowed them in popular favour,
causing the original Yellows to be carelessly mated and inter-bred
with Greens.

In the early spring of 1933 I bought two pairs of Cordon Bleus.
They are the first Cordons I have owned and I did not know anything
about them or their nesting habits but had been told that they were
delicate and hard to breed.
The weather was very cold at the time, so I kept them in the house
until May, when I fixed up a flight in the aviary 4 feet square. I
put in different kinds of nests, some covered and some open, and in
one end of the flight placed brush about 8 inches thick.
I regret I cannot give the date I put the two pairs in, but I did
not expect to raise young, so did not keep any record. However, both
pairs were quite friendly for about a week and you would often see
both males sitting on the same perch with a straw in their beaks,
dancing up and down and singing.
The birds took no notice of the nests I had fixed up, but in about
a week one of the hens commenced to build a nest among the brush
and completed it in about three days. At this time one male turned
against the other, and would certainly have killed him had I not removed
one pair to another flight. The nesting pair sat close from the first,
and whenever the hen came off the nest the cock at once went on. In
fact, the cock seemed to sit almost as much as the hen.
I think the young hatched in about fourteen days. However,
about that time the cock began busily picking amongst the litter, as

if looking for something he could not find. I knew they required insect
food to raise young so secured dried ants' " eggs ", which I soaked
and mixed with egg food, but they did not seem to want that. They
would dig it over with their beaks as if trying to find something else.
I tried them with earwigs and wood bugs, but these they would not
touch. I offered them mealworms chopped up, but they did not want
them. I then got some live ants' " eggs ", which they seemed to like
better, and I believe they would have raised their young on them,
but still there would be ants' " eggs " on the floor and they would be
hunting among the litter looking for something.
At this time, while hunting for ants' pupae, I came across white
grubs in the ants' nest which were so soft that I could hardly pick
them up without crushing them ; I believe they were ant larvae. I
took some home and threw a handful to the birds. As soon as they saw
them they flew down and ate them most greedily, and from that moment
their food problem was solved. After they tasted them they would
not touch live ants' pupae (eggs) and they raised all their young on the
larvae alone. They scarcely ever touched seed, and egg food they hardly
tasted, although I offered it every day. They ate very little green food.
Twenty Young from One Pair in One Season
In the first nest they raised four young and as soon as they had
left the nest the cock bird started to build another among the brush
and in two days, working by himself, he had it completed. The young
started to feed themselves when about a week out of the nest. I left
them along with the old ones until just before the next were due to
hatch.
In the second nest they raised six fine, strong young, and as before,
as soon as the young left the nest the cock started to build, and in
a few days the hen was again sitting. As before, I left the young with
the parents until the next young were due to hatch.
In the third nest they raised seven young, and in the fourth nest,
three young, which left the nest on 30th October, and I am sorry to
say they have gone to nest again, but I will certainly not let them hatch.
As soon as the young can feed themselves, I will take them all out of
that flight for the winter.

It is extraordinary how they ever raised the last brood as we had
some very cold weather. About the time the young hatched we had
two nights of quite hard frost and later had much cold, rainy weather.
The last nest was built against the outside wire and sometimes the
nest seemed to be soaked. How the young were not drowned I cannot
understand.
So far I have not found Cordon Bleus delicate or hard to breed,
which may be beginner's luck. The record for the one pair for one
season was twenty young and I did not lose one. They built a new, dome-
shaped nest among the brush every time.
Three years ago a Vancouver man was presented with a medal
for raising two Cordon Bleus, the first ever raised in Canada. None,
to my knowledge, have been raised since. I would very much like to
know the record for one pair in one season in England.

THE BREEDING OF THE HOODED
PARRAKEET
(Psephotellus dissimilis )

The successful breeding of this, the most graceful and lovely of
the smaller broadtails that are occasionally imported into Great
Britain, is a rare event ; indeed, apart from Mr. Astley's first record
and a couple of very miserable specimens reared indoors during the
winter when my collection was in temporary quarters at Binstead,
I do not know of any other instances for England or even in Europe.
For one thing Hooded very rarely come over and then only in very
small numbers. For another, although some individuals are more
accommodating than the majority, they are, as a species, most tire-
some about sticking to Australian seasons, moulting all summer and
trying to breed in October when their delicate young have not the
remotest chance of survival in the only healthy environment for a
Parrakeet nest, viz. the open air.
Hooded Parrakeets are about the same length as a Red-rump but

much more slender. The cock has the cheeks, throat, breast, and rump
a lovely pale blue with a tinge of sea-green. The cap, back of the neck,
and mantle are sooty black and sooty grey and in each wing is a large
patch of buttercup yellow. The tail is very narrow and the central
feathers are dark. Both sexes have the under tail-coverts salmon
coloured. The hen is very different from her mate as is usual with the
Psephoti. Her general plumage is pale yellowish olive with a pale
blue rump and a pale bluish mother-of-pearl tint on the cheeks, throat,
breast, and under parts. The young of both sexes much resemble the
hen, immature cocks being a little bigger than their sisters and having
bluer cheeks. Unlike Red-rumps and Many-colours, they do not
assume adult plumage until they are a year old.
The call of the Hooded Parrakeet is less musical than that of its
allies but is not loud enough to be in any way objectionable. The cock
when displaying depresses his wings, puffs the feathers of the head
and lower breast, and tucks in his " chin ", making a slight curtsey
as he alights and uttering a call rather like the syllables " Chissick " !
Hooded Parrakeets do well in certain districts ; badly in others ;
an inland situation appearing to be healthier for them than one near
the sea. They throve extremely well at Woburn with no particular
care and do well with Mr. Boosey at Keston. Mr. Ezra's pair also appear
to thrive. Peasmarsh, unfortunately, does not really suit them. I
lost my first hen and both of my present breeding pair have been ill
more than once though I hope they are now more acclimatized.
Hooded Parrakeets in a wild state breed in termite mounds, making
a burrow like their cousin the Paradise. Australian aviculturalists
have, I believe, induced them to use artificial nests of baked clay
which, no doubt, are the healthiest type for the young, but so far I
have not been able to induce them to patronize such nests at a reason-
able time of year.
No Parrakeet in proportion to its size needs more flying exercise
than the Hooded and none is more easily harmed by close confine-
ment and hard artificial perches. Deprived of exercise and slender
twigs to perch on, its beak and feet quickly become deformed, its
tail feathers grow crooked and unsightly, and in a year or two it makes
its exit to a happier world.

The hen of my present pair is one of four who had lived at Keston
in enforced spinsterhood for a number of years. For a time she was
paired to a Red-rump, but although they were quite friendly they did
not nest. When my first hen died she was sent to console the widowed
cock.
I made every effort to induce her to adapt herself to British seasons,
removing her nest firmly in September when she was just beginning
to take an interest in it in the hope of forcing her to moult earlier and
make an earlier start the next summer. This plan answers with some
hens but not with this one. Kef using to be discouraged, in 1931 she
deposited her eggs on the sand tray on the floor of the aviary shelter
and sat on them resolutely but, though two were fertile, they failed
to hatch. She made another attempt in the same place in January
but got egg-bound with her second egg and on being returned to the
aviary fortunately gave up further thoughts of breeding. In February
she and her mate raised my hopes of an early moult by dropping a
few feathers but they never properly got down to the job and went at
it again in earnest at the end of May, wasting June, July, and August.
In September she again laid on the floor of the shelter and sat like
an Albatross on the top of a raised mound of peat. This time she hatched
two young but they died almost at once although their crops were full
of food. In January she made another attempt, got egg-bound as before,
and faithfully repeated all her tactics of 1931.
This year I surrendered to the point of allowing her a wooden nest-
box with a coco-nut husk bottom when the return of autumn made
outdoor nesting no longer possible. I did not for a moment expect her
to do any good as I have never reared decent young even of much
hardier species in an aviary shelter with artificial heat. Rather to my
surprise the three eggs all hatched. Still more to my surprise the young
did not immediately die. I was giving the parents, instead of ordinary
drinking water, a small tea-cup of water to which had been added some
drops of orange juice and some raw yolk of egg. To the use of
this preparation, which has given remarkably good results with other
broods, I attribute most of my success. The parents in the way of food
had spray millet, of which they are very fond, white millet, hemp,
sunflower and canary, some dry, some thrown on the earth in the

flight. They also had groundsel and growing grass ad lib. Every week
I expected disaster but the brood continued to grow at quite a good
rate and in time it became apparent that they were fairly good on their
legs instead of being hopelessly rickety as I expected. Towards the
end of November sounds of active scrambling in the box announced
the coming exit of the family and a day or two later a young cock
was sitting on the floor of the shelter. He could not fly but was fully
feathered and quite well grown. With such unfavourable conditions
it was hardly to be hoped for that the young would be free from every
kind of temporary weakness. Two days later a sister joined him, and
after about three days another little hen more inclined to be weakly
than the others.
For about ten days the family continued to prosper, still, however,
keeping to the floor of the shelter. Then I made a mistake. Although
the shelter was well warmed with a petrol heater it was very dark on
the ground and I felt that the sooner the young birds were moved
to a nice roomy flight cage the better. Also I was not sure of the tempers
of the parents. They were obviously anxious to nest again and many
cock Psephoti hold pretty decided views about children earning their
own living as soon as they can fly. It would be a tragedy to have them
killed when they had got so far. I had no fear about their being unable
to feed themselves as I have never known young Parrakeets that length
of time out of the nest fail to start eating if well supplied with soaked
seed and especially soaked spray millet. I therefore told my aviary
attendant to bring them into the bird-room, but I was going to be
absent from home myself and did not return till three days later. When
I did get back it was already dark and it was more or less by accident
that I decided to go across to the aviary field to make sure the young
Hooded were going on all right. When I turned on the light to my horror
I saw that they were anything but all right. They had never fed at
all and the aviary attendant had not noticed it before the afternoon
of the third day and had failed to get them properly started with hand-
feeding. Consequently they were in a state of collapse and when I
touched the cock he had a kind of convulsion and I thought he was
going to depart this life straight away.
I at once rushed them into the hospital and a temperature of 85*,

got some milk with raw egg beaten up in it, some brown bread, soaked
sunflower seed, and soaked wheat. Starving as they were, they were
old and nervous enough to be very awkward patients. The stronger
little hen was the least far gone and after a good deal of protesting
wriggling she began to nibble some brown bread chewed up and
moistened with egg and milk. Her sister, though very feeble and un-
willing to touch anything solid, condescended to drink a little egg and
milk off the end of a paint-brush. But the cock, who, by reason of the
superabundance of the opposite sex in my collection I most wanted to
rear, seemed hopeless. He was too far gone to swallow and even the
tiniest drops of milk put gently into his beak only came back through
his nostrils and produced fits of gasping.
I spent about three hours in the exceedingly cosy atmosphere
alternately coaxing first one and then the other to take more nourish-
ment. In time the heat and the wonderfully nutritious properties of
egg and milk began to take effect. Even the cock seemed a little stronger
and at length the happy moment arrived when he, too, began to nibble
feebly.
When you have a sick nestling Parrakeet to deal with it is no use
doing things by halves. I went out again at midnight, at 3 a.m., and
at 6 to continue the feeding. By midday the situation appeared to
have been saved, and even the little weakly hen made quite a good meal.
She preferred to be held on my knee but her brother and sister liked
having their food offered them in the cage off the tip of a finger very
cautiously put out to them. By this time they had passed a definite
veto on brown bread and insisted on soaked sunflower and soaked wheat
carefully chewed up.
Alas ! that afternoon the hospital temperature was allowed
to drop ten degrees and when I came to give the evening feed
the babies were looking less well and with very little warning
the smaller hen collapsed and died. I was anxious about the cock
but the raising of the temperature and another night of broken slumber
for me put him right again and next morning I got them both to take
their chewed seed freely from a dish. They are now back in the bird-room
and are beginning to fly but are still extraordinarily slow to learn to
shell seed, living mainly on soft food and during the last few days

eating a little crushed seed and soaked spray millet. They have also
begun having baths. Whether their abnormally long babyhood is
characteristic of the species, or is merely the result of an early environ-
ment not too favourable, I cannot say, but I am inclined to suspect
the former ; other much more weakly Parrakeet babies I have had to

ASSUMPTION OF BREEDING PLUMAGE IN THE RUFF

It may interest Members of the Avicultural Society who make a special
study of the waders to know the length of time taken by Ruffs (Machetes
pugnax) to assume the extraordinary breeding plumage. I have two Ruffs
in one of my aviaries, a white and brown variety, and in spring I took a careful
note of the time taken to complete the change ; here are the extracts from
my diary:--
19.4.31. The white and brown Ruffs have just begun to change colour on
the head only.
24.4.31. The Ruffs are now very decidedly changed. The brown has descended
down the neck and the white one has got a decided white head.
6.5.31. Ruffs : These two birds are getting whiter and browner respectively.
The brown bird is beginning to show the ruff or collar, the white
bird is getting very much whiter.
Reeve : This bird is loosing its grey winter coat and assuming
the summer plumage, breast and sides of head getting light grey,
large black feathers appearing on the breast here and there.
7.5.31. The white Ruff now shows a most distinct collar if one comes on him
unawares, if startled he immediately flattens the collar down, it
is then practically unnoticeable.
23.5.31. The Ruffs have now got quite full collars which they spread out
giving them a very pugnacious appearance.

THE BLACK MAMBA

Members are, I am sure, deeply interested in the experiences of your
widely travelled correspondent, Mr. C. S. Webb. He is, however, in my humble
opinion, a trifle sceptical despite his varied travels and experiences.
Although our Society is not primarily interested in snakes Mr. Webb's
contribution in your last issue dealing with these reptiles was most interesting.
Mr. Webb casts doubt upon the coloration and temperament of the Black
Mamba. I can assure him he need have no doubts about either.
The first man I saw die in Bechuanaland in 1895 was a white man who
died from a Black Mamba bite. We kept him alive for some hours by pouring

neat whisky down his throat and marching him up and down. In relays
we took turns at this, forcing him to stagger along when he would have lain
down. He died, and so did all things bitten by Mambas until F. W. Fitzsimons,
F.Z.S., Curator of the Port Elizabeth Museum and Snake Park, perfected his
serum. If any man living knows anything at all about African snakes it is
Professor Fitzsimons and his black assistant Johann. The latter has survived
more snake-bites than any living person.
In his book Snakes, Professor Fitzsimons writes, upon page 177, as
follows :--
" In the day's post there was a letter from a Civil Commissioner in Northern
Rhodesia to the effect that he had shot a snake which measured 11 ft. 9 ins.
and he was posting its pickled head to me for identification. It
proved to be a typical black Mamba, which had been the cause of a reign
of terror. Its lair was a shrub and rock-strewn hill-side, and from this retreat
it occasionally sallied forth, chased and bit passing natives or herd boys.
Eleven human beings it has accounted for over a period of three years, and
in no instance did the victim live beyond one hour--most of them died in
twenty minutes--owing to the fact of their being bitten on the bare body."
The Black Mamba was, in my African days, much more common than
the green variety, which was regarded as a sport. They move with incredible
swiftness. Although averaging 12 feet in length they move over the ground
so quickly that the human eye cannot follow their movements for long.
Personally I am not a sceptic. I remember only too vividly the fools
who laughed at the stories of the spitting snakes (now scientifically admitted),
the pigmy-people (long ago " cinematized "), and the Okapi. There is always
something at the basis of these legends although the legends may become
greatly exaggerated in course of time. Unfortunately for hundreds of poor
humans and animals who have died horrible deaths there is no legend
surrounding the Black Mamba. He is a 100 per cent killer.
P.S.--The colour of the Black Mamba ( Dendraspis angusticeps) is shiny
gun-metal black.
H. Moore, F.Z.S.
(Buluwayo Field Force Artillery, 1896.)
The above letter was shown to Dr. Burgess Barnett, Curator of Reptiles
to the Zoological Society, who makes the following observations ;--
There are four species of Mambas, one of which, Dendraspis angusticeps,
varies a good deal in coloration, being bright green, olive or blackish above
and yellowish or blackish beneath. The darker phases of these snakes are
known as Black Mambas, though they are never, I believe, entirely black.
It is interesting to learn that the so-called black variety is, or was,
commoner than the green in parts of South Africa, for the London Zoo has
never been able to procure one.
In the only case of Mamba-bite that has come under my notice the snake
had been handled for several days before it bit, and the patient recovered
after the use of the serum prepared by the Pasteur Institute.
I am, however, in full agreement with Mr. Moore as to the deadly character
of Mambas, though I have no evidence that one variety is more fatal than the
other.

Mr. Rogers begs to advise the first arrival for many years of the Carolina or Mourning
Dove, Zenaidura macroura carolensis. A few pairs of this really rare Dove are due
here about yth March, aviary-bred, and this pretty little bird should be a great
acquisition to British Aviculturists. They breed freely in captivity, having two nests
a year, one in April and June.
If you are interested in this very rare and graceful bird, it would be advisable to
reserve whatever you require in advance as supplies are strictly limited, price

Mr. P. H. Hastings has earned the gratitude of all Parrot lovers by
placing on the market the only seed mixture I have come across which is
really suitable for the feeding of all species of Parrots, Cockatoos and
Parrakeets which are commonly kept as cage birds.
He also sells a thoroughly sensible mixture suited to Budgerigars and
Lovebirds, which is free from the objectionable Red and Yellow Millets
so often included.

The Kea ( Nestor notabilis)
Thousands of feet above sea-level, on the highest ranges of the
Southern Alps of New Zealand, amid scenes of unparallelled splendour,
where the glittering snow-capped peaks of New Zealand's highest
mountains pierce the celestial blue of the Southern skies, in regions
of eternal snow and ice, where the great blue-green glaciers roll almost
imperceptibly down from the highest peaks, at the very limit of
the stunted alpine growth, we find that strangest of strange birds,
the Kea, to my mind the most fascinating and peculiar bird I have
ever come across.
For countless seons of time this highly aberrant Parrot has fought
the elements and won its battle, becoming in the course of time
perfectly adapted to its environment. But, alas, on the coming of
Man to its mountain fastness, the Kea found an enemy against whom
the odds were a million to one against winning. In vain has it battled
against the blizzards of a million years ; at one swift stroke, com-
paratively speaking, its death knell was sounded.
That the Kea will become extinct is a matter of much speculation
on the part of naturalists. Some say that owing to the inaccessibility

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
of its haunts it will never be shot out, but there are few spots now in
the South Island of New Zealand where the sheep farmers have not
penetrated, and the Kea is to the average sheep farmer what a red
rag is to a bull. Other observers state that the Kea will linger on
only in the places where it is protected. I am not in a position to
make a statement either way except that in passing through a great
portion of the Southern Alps I only saw this parrot at Mount Cook
where it is protected.
If it does become extinct, perhaps they will tell us that, after all r
it might have been a mistake about its carnivorous habits, but it
will be too late then !
Everything is being done to foster the idea about the Kea's feeding
upon mutton. Children in schools are taught about a horrible
rapacious bird which feeds on the kidneys of living sheep. People
who should know very much better have cases set up in museums
with half a dozen Keas in the act of devouring the carcass of a lamb
heavily daubed with crimson paint.
Most people, naturalists included, love to add a little sensationalism,
often at the expense of truth, to what otherwise appears to them dry
scientific fact. Any out-of-the-way trait in the life of an animal is
at once seized upon and enlarged beyond recognition, such as the
fictitious remnants of the third eye in the Tuatara (Sphenodon
punctatum) a very rare and primitive form of lizard found only on one
or two islands off the East coast of New Zealand. And so it is with
the Kea, the association of this bird and sheep seems inseparable.
Every time we see a Kea pictured in a scientific book, in the back-
ground there are usually two of these " monsters " in the very act
of tearing out the kidneys of a sheep. To my mind it would be just as
incongruous to represent human beings every time they were pictured,
to be feasting on a mutton chop, and I'm sure that humans are far
more entitled to be shown eating sheep than these parrots. For
the majority of people feed at least once or twice a week on a sheep's
carcass, and that is far more than the average Kea does. In fact,
I still have to be convinced that this bird kills sheep at all. No
one I ever met had ever seen a Kea kill a sheep, except one man
whom I met, who said that he had seen two hundred killed in a night t

I hardly liked to say that he was lying, so I merely said that at that
rate they might easily dispense with the services of the slaughterman.
But with the tales of sheep-killing it is always the old story of some-
one who knew someone else whose friend had seen them.
No bird in the world is more malignantly libelled than the Kea,
and usually by people who know nothing whatever about it.
It is hard to imagine a bird, belonging to a family whose members
are confined solely to the tropics, being able to sustain itself in such
inhospitable regions, especially in the winter time, and sometimes
even in the summer when bitter winds and furious blizzards roar up
the alpine valleys where the Kea makes its home. For days at a time
torrential rains beat down, and the valleys fill up with drifting clouds
and mists. Sometimes the winds are so strong that it is impossible
to stand upright.
Not only does this bird manage to maintain itself, but it is able
to "do itself very well 55 as they say in Yorkshire. With a specially
adapted beak it digs amongst the alpine vegetation finding succulent
roots, etc., it also feeds to a great extent on the berries of the dwarfed
trees. It is a remarkable thing that some of the stunted trees which
grow only a few feet high bear larger berries than the same species
which grows to the height of a hundred feet or more in the low-land
forests. Most of the droppings which I examined contained the
seeds of various alpine plants ; as these were intact the bird must act
as the distributing agent for many of the berry-bearing shrubs of those
regions.
I have often seen them pull out quite large stones from the hill-
sides obviously looking for something underneath ; possibly for grubs
or insects of some sort.
Keas are fascinating birds to watch ; never in my travels have
I met a bird of such interest. The chief trait in its character is un-
bounded curiosity. One has only to sit down quietly, especially
in the evenings and in a quarter of an hour or so one is surrounded by
a crowd of these inquisitive birds. They never seem to alight near
one, but usually a distance away and with a kind of a hop, skip, and
a jump gradually get closer and closer until at last one is surrounded
on every side by throngs of quietly speculating birds. They come

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
within a few feet showing not the slightest fear. It is rather embarrass-
ing and reminds me of going into an African village at the back of
beyond and becoming in time the centre of attraction to a crowd of
dusky youngsters who seem to have gathered from nowhere. The
birds watch every action and examine every article left lying about.
Sticks, cameras, glasses, coats, etc., come in for the closest scrutiny.
At first the birds touch each article very gingerly with the tip of their
beak, then they feel it with their tongue and when at last they feel
that it is safe it is dragged away and if possible destroyed.
A stranger they seem to recognize and crowd around, but the
ordinary people at one of the rest huts at Mount Cook they seem to
take little notice of. A new extension to the hut was being built and
the birds showed the greatest interest in the wood and tools which
were lying about. Everything unusual they examined with the greatest
interest. They would also come round and watch the workmen at
their various jobs.
A carrot is a great attraction to them and if cut into small pieces
will attract a crowd. If one throws the pieces towards the birds they
dodge as quick as lightning out of the way as though they expected a
stone or some other missile to be thrown, then they come up cautiously
and pick up the bits. Sometimes a bird will tolerate another quite
close to it and at other times they make furious digs at each other.
It is very amusing to watch a bird trying to push another away with
its foot, especially if it is trying to push it over the cliff. The one
on the defensive will hang on as long as possible until it is finally forced
to take flight. Sometimes a bird will trot up to another and affection-
ately lay its head against the other's.
I think the fascination of the Kea lies in the fact that it has such
a human element in its nature. I could have spent months watching
them and their curious habits. I often wondered whether, if only
their persecutors knew them as intimately as I did, they would have
the heart to massacre them as they do.
Thanks to the untiring efforts of the New Zealand Native Bird
Protection Society and a few other enlightened people, the Government
subsidy has been taken off the head of the Kea. At one time it
was Is. 6d., then it dropped to 5s., later to 2s. 6 d., and now it is
nothing at all.

It was not for love of the Kea that the subsidy was taken off, far
from that. The argument the N.Z.N.B.P.S. used was, why should
the taxpayer have to pay for ridding the sheep farms of vermin ?
Why should a man buy a farm over-run with Keas and the taxpayer
be asked to pay for the clearance and give him a good income into
the bargain ? Why did not the Government pay for rats, mice, rabbits,
etc. ? There was a publicity campaign, and a deputation sa&amp;apos;w various
ministers. The money question saved the day. It was the old, old
story of why should some one pay for some one else. The old saying,
" The hand that signs the cheque book rules the world 55 is very true.
The fate of the Kea didn't matter a little bit. They could have pleaded
for ever for the bird but when the money question came up, ah, well !
That was a totally different matter !
When the subsidy of 5s. per head was being paid, quite a few of the
alpine guides supplemented their incomes by shooting the birds
surreptitiously. They would take up small pea rifles and at a distance
of a few feet would kill half a dozen Keas. The heads would be cut
off and sent to the nearest depot and the killer would be awarded 5s.
per head. This meant quite a nice little income. It is little wonder
that these men and also farmers and the shepherds were anxious to
keep alive the rumour about the Keas sheep-eating propensities.
Travellers come into the alpine regions where the bird is found,
ask a few questions about it, usually never see the birds at all, then
write a book. The two following are extracts from such types of
books, " These most destructive creatures are found in great numbers
at the foot of snow mountains and kill the sheep by fastening their
strong claws to the wool while they tear the flesh and eat out the livers,"
and again, " The Kea has a strange history. Once it lived on berries
and grubs but years ago it became fond of mutton, and according to
widely credited accounts it is very destructive to sheep. Alighting on
the back of a sheep, the Kea fixes its claws in the wool or flesh and
quickly makes an opening with its two-inch beak." And so the lies
grow. This kind of tosh is usually written by people W&amp;apos;ho know nothing
whatsoever about the habits of this bird, but who jump at any bit
of sensationalism to enliven the otherwise dull pages of their literary
products.

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
I was going to say that the Kea is completely terrestrial, but that
is pretty obvious, for it lives mainly above the tree line, but it is also
a bird of the air, spending almost as much of its time in that element
as upon the ground. It is a wonderful sight to see a flock of these
birds wheeling round and round in the brilliant and intense sunshine
in the rarified atmosphere of the great ice peaks.
They are transformed from the dull greenish bird which we see in
captivity or in museums ; for it is then that we see the bright yellow-
spotted flight and tail feathers and the beautiful bright orange under-
wing coverts. In its proper setting the Kea is a beautiful bird, often the
only splash of colour in the sombre, desolate and stony valleys. I was
astounded to find another bird which one does not usually associate
with alpine regions, namely the Southern Black-backed Gull (Larus
dominicanus) with which the Kea consorts. I have often seen a flock
of Keas and Gulls mingled together wheeling overhead. The call of
the Kea, when once heard, is never forgotten, for it is very distinctive.
It is somewhat between the mewing of a seagull and the yelp of a dog.
Sometimes the birds will make a call like that of a cat, at other times
there is a strangely human sound in the calls.
They are extremely noisy birds, especially when on the wing and
up in their mountain home. Few other sounds are to be heard except
the continual thunder of falling avalanches or the cracking of the
ice in the glaciers. When in the air the tips of the primary flight
feathers are separated and upturned like those of an eagle ; in fact
the bird looks very hawk-like when in flight and this, no doubt, lends
colour to the sheep-eating tales. Around the Ball Hut by the Tasman
Glacier at Mount Cook (12,349 feet) the Keas are fairly numerous ;
there must be from fifty to sixty in the locality. Fortunately they are
protected by the authorities at the Hermitage, the hostel at Mount
Cook. But there are even people, including certain members of
Parliament, who are using every effort to get them destroyed, and yet
never in the history of the Hermitage has a Kea been known to touch
a sheep, although there are hundreds around there, and Keas and
sheep live on quite friendly terms.
A garbage dump at the foot of a stony cliff at the Ball Hut, was
a great attraction to the Keas. They found many scraps to their

liking especially potato peelings. Their inquisitive nature also led
them to spend a good deal of their time examining various objects
such as tin cans, bottles, etc. There were one or two wild cats to be
seen consorting with the Parrots and though the cats wandered in
amongst the Keas, the birds took not the slightest notice of them.
The sexes are easy to distinguish, the male bird appears to have
the cere and the skin round the eye yellow, while in the female it is
black. The lower mandible in the male is also a much brighter yellow,
he also has a much lighter coloured cap. I have never seen this way
of sexing the Kea mentioned before but I am almost sure this is correct.
I thought at first that the dark coloured birds might be the young ones,
but there are several in the Wellington Zoo which have been there for
a considerable time and the skin still remains dark. I am open to
correction, though, on this matter.
Like many other New Zealand birds this Parrot is semi-nocturnal,
and can be heard flying around long after the light has fallen. It
can also be heard before the dawn in the mornings. With the four
birds which I brought back to England, I found that most of the
feeding was done at night. They roost in crevices in the rocks, under
overhanging boulders or beneath the thick, matted alpine bushes.
The Keas nest in deep holes in the rock, usually in places utterly
inaccessible to human beings. This is one thing that has been to a
large extent the salvation of the Kea. During the whole time that
" The Hermitage " has been in existance no one has ever found a single
nest and yet the guides are always penetrating to very remote
parts.
I was at Mount Cook in April and was told that the young ones had
been round for a month or so. By allowing four weeks for incubation
and six weeks for the young in the nest, it must be some time in
December when the eggs are laid.
It has been reported that eggs have been found in July, which would
be in the midst of the very severe alpine winter ; one would hardly
think that the birds would nest then.
The guide residing at the rest hut by the Tasman Glacier told me
that the Keas have a very annoying habit of flying up onto the central
ridge of the roof with small stones and then letting them roll down the

corrugated iron, the birds being amused apparently by the noise.
This must be very annoying for the inmates of the hut.
The colour of the Keas blends perfectly with the alpine vegetation
and yet the bird certainly needs no protective agency, for until the
coming of man it had no enemies except the elements.
One would think that this hardy Parrot would do well in an outdoor
aviary in England, but in its native sphere it does not meet with the
damp clinging cold of the English winter. In spite of the bitter and
intense cold there are long periods of brilliant sunshine which are
quite unknown in the Homeland in the winter time. Recent attempts
at importing Keas into England do not seem to have been very success-
ful. A few years ago twelve were captured and sent to the London
Zoological Society on board the Tahiti on her last unfortunate voyage
and although it was a long time before the boat sank, the Keas were
deemed to be not worth saving. Two more were brought home by
the captain of a certain ship, who, rather than bother to inquire about
the Parrot restrictions, threw them, cage and all, into the London
Docks. A couple of birds were sent to me last year but they succumbed
just before they reached these shores, mainly owing, I think, to the
effects of mutton broth upon which they were largely fed. I was
more successful in landing four birds in June of last year. It is said
that the bird is called the Kea after its cry and it does not need a great
stretch of imagination to pick out the particular cry which resembles
a long drawn out " Ke--ah ".
Cold does not seem to effect them much, for I have seen them sit
for lengthy periods on the ice crags of the glaciers. They do not seem
to mind the extreme coldness to their feet, in fact they seemed to
enjoy it.
The birds seem to feed to a certain extent on the juicy roots of a
certain mountain tussock grass, I noticed that they always pulled
the sections out of the middle of the clump, never at the sides ; after
the edible portion was chewed off, the fibrous part would be rejected.
In captivity the birds feed mainly on roots, such as carrots, kumeras
(the native sweet potato), swedes, etc. They are also fond of biscuits ;
they seem to take very little seed of any sort, although the ones at the
Wellington Zoo seem to be fed solely on dry maize. I think mealworms

would be beneficial in lieu of the grubs which they get in the wild
state. The Kea makes one of the most delightful pets that it is possible
to imagine and in my opinion ranks second to none in intelligence.
Even in the old days before there were any restrictions on New Zealand
birds the Kea was only very occasionally imported and then only to
Zoos. Very few, I think, have been in private hands. Given a large
outdoor aviary and a heap of large stones or rocks I see no reason why
it should not breed.
Those in authority at Mount Cook offered to let me take away
several Keas. I already had four, which I believe are cock birds.
I was offered hens, but somehow I had not the heart to take the birds
away from their happy little protected colony. Perhaps if they had
been in danger of extermination from the sheep farmers it might
have been a different thing. My own birds came from a different
district, and in time I may be able to procure hens.
The Kea stand for something so essentially New Zealand ; not
the New Zealand of to-day, but of that land of strange anomalies where,
until the coming of the " pakeha ", the unique vegetation and strange
bird life reigned supreme.
Like all the other natural products of that country, it does not
fit in with the scheme of things now. Barren hill-sides, destitute of
the alpine vegetation, barbed wire fences, and corrugated iron sheds
are no proper setting for the Kea. Every native product is sacrificed
on the altar of Mammon. The sheep farmers have extended their
domains right up to the snow line and all the alpine flora has been
burnt off ; no single ledge or patch where a sheep might get a mouthful
of grass has been spared.
The farmers in those regions, being true Britishers, had to kill
something, and in those days before the introduction of the chamois
and the thar the only living things were the sheep and the Keas, so
the Kea had to pay the price. As he was not on the list of conventional
sporting birds, an excuse had to be made for massacring this good-
natured and inquisitive bird, so they said that he ate the sheep. To
make this worse they said he ate the kidneys from living sheep. These
stories are very much on a par with the stories told in the English
country side of Nightjars sucking goat's milk, of eagles carrying off

children, and cuckoos changing into hawks on the approach of
winter.
Most observations of the ordinary person about birds are incorrect,
and it is quite an easy matter for a person to see Keas examining a dead
sheep, for they are exceedingly inquisitive birds, and for the rumour
to grow and grow until it was seized upon as a commercial proposition.
In a New Zealand magazine appeared an article written some little
time ago by a journalist obviously of the sensational school, and judging
by the literary ability displayed, he had been taught by that highly
efficient system which is guaranteed to produce a fully fledged
journalist in the short space of six months by the simple method of
postal lessons. Judging by his aptitude to produce the sensational,
he would have been far better reporting murder cases than investigating
the habits of the Kea. After a long discourse on the blood-thirsty habits
of this bird, absolute and conclusive proof was brought forward, a photo-
graph of a Kea with a huge lump of mutton just torn from the living
sheep. It was entitled " Guilty ". What evidence was there to be
brought forward to dispute this ? The photographer's trump card,
a camera cannot lie. No, but sometimes photographers do ! It
doubtless had convinced some people, but it didn't quite convince
me, for the Kea was stuffed, and very badly stuffed at that !
The journalist would possibly get #5, for his article and a unique
photograph, and the case against the bird was again strengthened.
So after all the Kea is a good commercial proposition for some people.
Talking about that reminds me of a little story which I heard from
a one-time gold prospector. A few years ago when seeking the precious
metal in the most southerly part of New Zealand, he came across
a professional Kea hunter, where there were no sheep or likely to be
any. He told the prospector that he was not such a fool to seek the
illusive metal as the Kea heads proved a veritable gold mine for him.
I also met in the South Island a person who had been a companion
in nearly all parts of the bush where the Kea is found, with one of
New Zealand's well known naturalists, and he stated that they had
never in all their travels come across an authentic case of the Kea
killing sheep.
The Kea, like a picture which needs a frame to set it off, also needs

n fit setting. Seen in an aviary or cage, he isn't the same bird as the
*one seen amid the glittering snow-capped peaks of his native home.
Bluebells in a jam jar are not like those in the misty blue haze in the
beech woods in the spring. And so it is with the Kea. He loses a
great deal of his charm when taken out of his proper setting. I have
taken people to see the Keas and they have usually been astonished
when they saw them. " Why, that can't be a Kea, it's a nice bird,
I always thought it was a horrible thing, something like a vulture ",
is the remark usually made by the lay person on seeing the Kea for
the first time.
Between the years of 1920 and 1928 the Government paid a subsidy
*on over twenty-nine thousand Kea heads.
I was told of a district on the western slopes of the Alps wdiere
Kakas and Keas were found in the vicinity, but I was told that the
two birds, although so closely allied, never consorted together.
Perhaps I have talked too much about this bird, but I must ask to
be forgiven, for to my mind it is one of the most interesting birds
in the whole world, and so many lies have been written about it that
I feel I must say something to vindicate its character.

By G. H. Gurney
The following notes are a rather belated account of some of the
more interesting species which bred at Keswick during the past summer.
\0x25A0Considering the abnormally hot dry summer we experienced in Norfolk,
us everywhere else, perhaps one might have expected more species to
have nested, but, owing to the abundance of live insect food, those
which did breed had more chance of rearing their young successfully
than in a cold damp summer, when live food, so absolutely necessary
for the majority of young birds, was scarce and difficult to get.
Gallinaceous birds, in good-sized pens where the grass was allowed
to grow long, were able to secure a fine supply of live insects and on
our light soil the supply of fresh ants' eggs was unlimited ; and how

young birds, of nearly every species, do gobble them up ! It seemed
as if their parents could not fill their beaks full enough, or often enough,
to satisfy their always clamorous offspring.
I have never known waterfowl wander so far afield to nest, my small
collection of ducks are generally satisfied with using natural, or
artificially-constructed, nesting-sites fairly near their water; but not
so this year. They all seemed to be possessed with a perfect mania
to get as far away from it as possible and, as the pond on which I keep
them is not enclosed in any way, they can go where they will and
as far as they will, and such species as South American Wigeon, Japanese
Spot-bills, Bahamas, and Mandarins nested in copses a long way off.
In some cases the nests were never located and the female, when
returning from feed, would show a perfectly uncanny instinct in
misleading any one who was trying to follow her in order to locate
the nest. If the nest was discovered, the eggs were probably taken
and reared under a foster mother, when they were very far away,
and if not found one hoped, in due course, one would see, some fine
morning, the old bird leading her newly-hatched family of youngsters
to the water.
Silver Pheasants, which are now well established here, practically
wild, nested all over the place, they are well adapted for semi-liberty,
as besides being extremely ornamental they stop in the paddocks
and enclosures, even though these are surrounded by woods, and
they could easily fly over the wire-netting divisions if they wanted to.
Ten or twelve old cocks in full plumage walking about together
make a very good show.
None of the Cranes laid at all, and the pair of Horned Screamers,
also having complete liberty and wandering where they will, disappointed
me. In the aviaries I think the following species were among the-
most interesting ones which nested :--
Donaldson's Turacoa, Turacus donaldsoni. A large nest of sticks
was made in a basket in the aviary shelter, and the hen sat well for
a long time, but no eggs were laid. I do not think the pair were
disturbed by various other birds in the same aviary.
Giant Kingfisher, Alcedo gigas. Nested in a hollow log in the-
aviary flight. The first egg was laid on 12th May, and two others on

G. H. Gurney--Breeding Notes from the Keswick Aviaries for 1933 77
the following consecutive days. Of these, two eggs were broken,
whether accidentally or the reverse I do not know, but knowing the
predilection of this species for eggs, I rather suspected the latter, and
if I had anything sitting at the time, the least bit suitable, I would
have removed the remaining egg, as I feared it would suffer the same
fate as the other two. However, the hen settled down and on the
whole sat well, though always popping out at the least alarm, but
the egg hatched successfully on 11th June. The young Kingfisher
was incredibly ugly, with black naked skin, and its huge beak and
staring eyes. The feathers took a very long time to grow, and for a
good fortnight it remained in practically the same state as when first
hatched, except it increased greatly in size but, when the feathers
did begin to start, it feathered very rapidly and left the nest on 18th July
a very fine bird, which before long became difficult to tell from its
parents. It consumed an enormous amount of food and was for ever
calling for more. This species has been bred at Lifford, and here
many years ago, but I do not think elsewhere.
Black-headed Grosbeak, Orizohorus torridus. This handsome
species nests here regularly, but always with the same result--the
young are thrown out of the nest when a few days old. This year
the first egg was laid on 9th May, and the full clutch of four followed
but, after sitting in exemplary fashion, the old birds disposed of their
offspring as mentioned above after seven days.
Starlings, as a whole, were very disappointing: pairs of Purple-
headed, Green Glossy, Bed-eyed, and Salvadoris, although in perfect
breeding condition, showed no signs of going to nest.
Superb Glossy Starling, Spreo superbus. I have two breeding pairs
of this species : one pair made no attempt at nesting. The other pair
hatched several young, but none were reared, as they were thrown out
of the nesting log when about a week old.
White-headed Starling, Heteropsar albicapillus. A pair built
several nests, but did not seem able to settle down and no eggs were
laid. They may have been disturbed by other birds, and if they
survive I shall give them an aviary to themselves next summer.
Bose-coloured Pastor, Pastor roseus. I have had a pair of these
birds for several years and, though alone in what I should have

78 G. H. Gurney--Breeding Notes from the Keswick Aviaries for 1933
considered a suitable aviary, they never made any attempt to breed.
Last spring, for the sake of convenience, they were moved into another
aviary, where there were a number of birds. However, they paid no
attention to these, and at once took possession of a Parrakeets 5 nesting
box fixed high up in the aviary shelter. I am not sure of the exact
date, as it was impossible to inspect the log without great disturbance,
but I believe the first egg was laid on 30th May. Only two eggs were
laid, and only one hatched, and a fine young bird appeared outside on
24th June. The amount of mealworms and fresh ants' eggs this
youngster consumed was simply incredible ; it seemed impossible to
satisfy it, and the parents from having been very shy became quite
the reverse, and if any one passed the outside of the flight would
immediately fly to the front and cling to the wire-netting, clamouring
for more, and yet more, mealworms for their insatiable baby. This
young Pastor, from six weeks old to three months, was indistinguishable
from an immature Common Starling, Sturnus vulgaris , and, as the two
species mix together on the Continent, it must very often pass quite
unnoticed. Several very eminent ornithologists who visited the
aviaries during the summer--men who would not hesitate to name
correctly the most difficult Cisticola at sight--were completely non-
plussed by the young Pastor, and one well-known aviculturist spotted
it from an adjoining aviary and remarked, " Oh, what have you got
there ? " It was not till November that any trace of black appeared ;
now it is rapidly assuming adult plumage. This species has never
before been bred in England, though I believe there is a Continental
record for it.
Green Cardinal, Guhernatrix cristatella. A pair made a nest in a

laid, but none were hatched.
Black Crake, Limnocorax niger. The first nest was made in a large
tuft of grass near the water pool. On 1st May there were three eggs
in the nest, but only one hatched, this was fully reared. The second
clutch was laid on 8th June--the full lot of four eggs--of these two
hatched, and were successfully reared. It was a pretty sight to see the
half-grown young bird of the first clutch tend and feed his brothers
and sisters of the second brood. Numbers of double brooded birds will
do this, noticeably waterhens and some of the partridges. The young
Black Rails when first hatched are tiny little balls of black fluff, for
the first few days really not much bigger than a large bumble bee,,
and easily able to squeeze through half-inch mesh wire-netting. They
are rather slow in growing, but not specially difficult to rear.
Cayenne Rail, Creciscus cayennensis. Four eggs were laid during
May, but they were unfertile, and I rather doubt if I have a true pair.
This species has been bred here in the past, as well as the larger species r

Crowned Lapwing, Stephanibyx coronatus. These birds started to
nest as early as 14th February, on which date the first egg was laid,,
two more being added on the 16th and 18th. The nest was in the open
flight, partially concealed by a large tussock of grass, it merely con-
sisting of a shallow scrape with a few bents of dried grass laid in it.
Both birds took turns in sitting, but the eggs, although fertile, did
not hatch, and I put this down to the early laying and cold weather
at the time. They laid again on 2nd May, this time the eggs being
placed on the sand in the aviary shelter without any attempt at
concealment. Three eggs composed the clutch, and again both birds
sat tight and were never seen off the eggs for a minute, when the
change was made, one bird coming off to feed, the other immediately
took its place. Again we were disappointed, the eggs for the second
time failing to hatch although containing fully developed chicks.
Possibly they were too weak to break the shells.

By F. E. Blaauw, F.M.Z.S.
Whilst travelling by train from Buenos Aires to Mendoza I saw
this species in a wild state in a large shallow lake.
It was a couple of hours after we had passed Bufino that the train
travelled over a dam that had been constructed in that lake.
It was in the month of March, 1911, and as soon as we came upon
the dam I was struck by the sight of countless numbers of the beautiful
pink birds standing in the shallow places.
I was also agreeably surprised by the sight of half a dozen Coscoroba
Swans which were swimming quite close to the railway track. It was
probably a summer or autumn resort for the Flamingos, because when
about two months later I re-passed the lake nearly all the birds
were gone.
Later on when I visited the north-western part of Tierra del Fuego,
staying at a sheep farm at Zentes Grande (name of the farm), I saw
again some Flamingos, five in all, standing in a shallow lagoon and
I was told by the manager of the farm that the Flamingos were winter
visitors there and that the birds I had seen were probably the first
ones of that season.
They frequented mostly, he told me, the salt lagoons which were
less liable to be frozen over than the fresh-water ones.
The birds were rather shy and I could not get very near them as
they flew away on my approach.

F. E. Blaauw--Some Notes on the Argentinian Flamingo 81
In the same lagoon, which was apparently very shallow in some
places, stood numbers of Blackbanded Geese, Chlcejphaga disbar.
There were also several pairs of the Flying Steamer Duck, Tachyeres
&amp;apos;patagonicus and several Anas cristata.
In the year 1920 or 1921 I succeeded in getting two pairs of
Argentine Flamingos alive at Gooilust. One pair was in the adult
dress and one pair in the immature feathering. These last two
birds were greyish-white with a number of spots and stripes of
a brownish-black colour on the upper side and they had also greyish
legs and feet and white and black bills. The four birds did very
well and were fed on soaked wheat and dried ground shrimps, and they
fed the greater part of the day on the minute animals which they
found in their pond.
Towards autumn the birds moulted and the two adult ones improved
considerably in colour, the red " paillettes " and the red lengthened
wing coverts becoming gorgeously beautiful.
The young birds also began to show some pink, but it took years
before they had quite got rid of their immature dress, improving,
however, at every moult, so that at the present time they are perfect
specimens of coloration. Last autumn was favoured by very fine
weather and the month of August was particularly hot and I suppose
that the result of this is that the birds showed a coloration which
they had never shown before and which I never found mentioned
anywhere.
As a rule the legs of this species of Flamingo are bluish-grey or
slate colour with scarlet tarsal joints and feet. This autumn, however,
the upper parts of the legs from the red tarsal joints to the feathered
thighs became of a wonderful shining yellow colour with a greenish
shine in it, whilst under the joint the tarsus itself only showed the
slightest indication of this glorious coloration. Very likely this is
the usual thing for these birds to assume in the breeding season and
that the hot August and sunny autumn enabled the birds to show it
on this occasion. I have always hoped to see the birds nest but only
once a few years ago did they make any attempt at nesting.
That summer was rather sunny and warm and the water* in the
pond got very low and this induced one of the two pairs to make a

small mound of sand. Before it was finished, unfortunately, the
weather changed and the water rose considerably and those two things
apparently so discouraged the birds that they gave up the attempt and
they have never repeated it. When the birds are courting each other
they erect the beautifully coloured and lengthened feathers of the
upper side.
In this country I have to take the birds in the bird-house during
the winter as extreme cold gives them leg-sores.

By John Wilcock, B.A., M.B.O.U.
It is not imagined that any new views or theories are to be put
forward in what I should like to say ; rather is the intention to
emphasize a few general facts and principles realized by most of us,
but sometimes overlooked to the detriment of the ends we have in
view. In doing this I may imply, in all humility, one or two faults
which I think are sometimes prevalent amongst some of us.
Perhaps it would be best at the outset to focus attention on what
our aims really are. If " aviculture " means anything it is the
attempt to produce and maintain in captivity various species of birds.
I would emphasize as strongly as possible the word " maintain ", for
nothing less than this, seriously and persistently pursued, justifies
in dealers' premises cages of Gouldians and other Grassfinches, the
Lovebirds we saw before the parrot ban, and many other species.
I would emphasize the word because there is no doubt about it that
aviculturists are a fickle lot. A breeding success achieved once or
twice, and we turn to " fresh fields and pastures new " ; at least,
too many of us do. The reason for this fickleness is not far to seek;
we have such a diversity of species at our call that it requires a strong
will at times not to acquire something we cannot accommodate without
sacrificing that which we have already successfully bred. But unless
a sufficient number of us find our recompense in breeding for generation
after generation chiefly the same species of birds, striving against any

diminution in vitality and fertility, we are no whit better than the
generation which has passed without leaving us, for example, a sound
stock of aviary-bred Turquoisines, which they apparently might
have done. Aviculturists of the stamp of the late Miss Alderson, who
could concentrate on her Foreign Doves and find it enthralling, seem
singularly rare nowadays. Now that it would appear that we are
to be vouchsafed by Nature another opportunity with the Neophema
it is to be hoped that the lesson has been taken to heart. Fortunately
a start is being made by that thorough and experienced aviculturist,
Mr. Harvey, of Adelaide, and by others. Surely there ought to be as
much pleasure and credit to be derived from attempting to achieve,
say, fourth generation aviary-bred birds which are as virile and prolific
as their wild-caught ancestors, as in getting a somewhat puny youngster
from the nest for the first time, without knowing just exactly how it
happened. And would it require much more self-discipline, to adopt
and stick to (chiefly) a certain number of species with this end in
view, than is required of people who take up other types of livestock,
horses, dogs, poultry, etc., and do their utmost to improve the breed
they have adopted, instead of squandering their efforts over a wide
field as the whim takes them ? As to the number of species which could
be taken up on these lines, this would of course vary with individuals,
according to the extent to which circumstances permitted them to
indulge their avicultural activities. I think, however, we are morally
compelled to view our hobby in this light and, as I see it, it is going to
be more necessary in the future than it has been in the past.
One little bird I have kept and bred for several years now, enjoy
keeping as much as ever, and shall enjoy attempting to bring near to
domestication, even if I fail, is the little Chinese Painted Quail.
I purchased my first pair in 1928, and the little hen soon laid, but would
not sit. This I discovered was almost usual, but I also learnt that
the father " mothered " the chicks. After attempting, with relatively
unsatisfactory results, to use a good modern incubator which was
" set " with hens eggs, I got a steady broody bantam and for several
years always succeeded in getting off a brood by this means, generally
having a few broken eggs, or chicks crushed when hatched, although
I was up betimes on the morning the chicks were due to hatch, to get

them away from the bantam and place them with the cock. I always
kept a set of old eggs to put in the nest the quail had laid in, to retain
the father's interest, and he was always very pleased with himself
when his offspring presented themselves. But I used foolishly to
sell the young, until it occurred to me that I should perhaps have a
better chance of natural incubation from an aviary-bred hen. I retained
one hen, got a cock for her, and she went broody her first year, and
has this year, her second, brought off her six chicks. I have kept
a young hen from this brood and with a new cock hope to have two
broods next year. Pairing uncle to neice should not be too close
inbreeding. I am hoping that the more generations aviary bred they
are, the more certain sitters they will make and, also perhaps, the
sooner even they can be weaned off live food. This year also the
hen took just as much interest in, and care of, the chicks as the father ;
generally the brood was evenly divided between them. I do not
know if this is unusual, but I had always understood that with
Excalfactoria the male alone undertook the care of the family. One
point which relieved my mind was the steady way the hen sat. The
aviary contained breeding pairs of various Australian Grassfinches,
and I always wish to have newly flown young in the shelter at night,
which necessitated my stepping within a foot of the little hen, who
didn't mind at all. I have had the satisfaction of hearing from people
who purchased young birds from me that they have successfully
incubated and have been very prolific.
I may be on the wrong track, and Painted Quail always remain
uncertain sitters, but here is a case where there is sufficient to aim
at to sustain interest for several years and, if success is complete
and something approaching semi-domestication attained, the
aviculturist can be relieved of his charge and the results handed over
to the " fancier ", as has happened with the Canary and Budgerigar.
The fancier can then carry on and breed them with crests or
feathered legs !
I have bred to several generations (I have carelessly neglected
to keep records, and therefore cannot be more exact) Longtailed
Grassfinches, Diamond Doves, and of course Zebra Finches, and have
birds every bit as prolific and virile as wild ones, with few cases of

egg-binding. But I cannot do anything with Gouldians. I have
had the same birds three years, and perhaps am unfortunate in my
particular specimens. The nearest I have been has been young dying
at fifteen days old, and the hen on the next attempt died of egg-
binding. Bichenoes have nested more than once, but have been
disturbed by the Longtails, but I am glad to say I still get as much
pleasure as ever when I have got out a good nest of Longtailed Grass-
finches as I did in the days when they were new to me seven years ago.
Just the old perenniels which have been discarded by the " advanced "
ones long ago ! I have not yet had an opportunity of trying Buficaudas
and Parrot Finches. But this brings me to the next point I would
like to make.
I believe that the amount of satisfaction which can be got from the
inmates of an aviary is almost in inverse ratio to their numbers. Of
course I mean within limits, and am referring to success in breeding,
which is the ultimate aim of our hobby. The " mixed collection "
isn't aviculture of course ; it is bird-fancying, and can be quite enter-
taining if carefully assorted. Everyone will readily agree that the
Grassfinches, Waxbills, and other smaller finch-like birds, the smaller
buntings, etc., cannot be systematically propagated by having what
appears to be an aviary full of birds. Even those birds which nest in
colonies in nature do not seem to get on together in an aviary. But
I do think that, although the above fact is readily conceded, the ideas
of many people still cause them to err on the side of overstocking and
they would consider their aviary empty if it only contained what at
least I consider the proper number.
Apart from the psychological effect on the birds of having to chose
nesting sites in close proximity to a neighbour's, even if they could
live together in perfect amity, they could not be kept under reasonably
hygienic conditions in the breeding season if many birds are installed.
Unless the numbers are very few the aviary wants thoroughly cleansing
very often and regularly--perches, ledges (if any), and windows as
well as floors. This cannot be done without disturbing birds which
are incubating, and therefore must be missed or scamped, with a
consequent increased incidence of disease and mortality or breeding
results jeopardized. We doubtless all feel the temptation to put in

just that " extra pair Resist it manfully. Many of the parrot-
like birds take the matter in their own hands (or beaks) and set about
readjusting the density of the population by killing each other ; with
other birds the error can often be persisted in without actual losses
from carnage, but breeding results are poor and we say the species
are uncertain or difficult breeders, or deaths result and the birds are
blamed for being delicate, not the owners for being bad naturalists.
Applied natural history goes a long way to successful aviculture ;
I suppose that is what is meant by " bird-sense
[Having mentioned the incidence of disease above, I would like to
put in here a word on the use of Yadil as an excellent preventive and
cure for epidemic diseases. I fly to it immediately I have a bird
at all " soft " and this and warmth generally affect a cure. The
rest of its aviary-mates also get a small dose (about five drops to a
teacupful of water) as a preventive.]
My own idea of the complement for a medium-sized aviary, carefully
assorted so that no pugnacious inmates are included, is some three
or four pairs in a 20 by 6 ft. aviary. With a pair of small doves
(Diamond Doves are of course ideal) and a pair of Chinese Painted
Quail, there is enough to satisfy any one. I am not implying that
aviaries ought to be of that size ; smaller ones with fewer breeding
pairs can be just as good ; as can large cages with single pairs, but
only provided the owner brings to the birds all that they would get
if in a garden aviary--and this involves a lot of time and work--abundant
supplies of seeding grass, seeding chickweed, and, for the first few days
after the young hatch, live insect food. These are all necessary to
make up for the lack of foraging space.
I have bred Zebra Finches in a large cage, producing eighteen
really fine young ones in one season from one pair, and destroying
one clutch of eggs. Every single bird was a full-sized tight feathered
specimen, always as fit as a fiddle. I refer to this because I have
mentioned 20 ft. aviaries, and I do not want to give the impression
that in my opinion this size is necessary, if the regime is adjusted
accordingly. Zebra Finches and Long-tailed Grassfinches search
eagerly for insect life when the nestlings are only a few days old ; they
can be seen imitating fly-catchers on the wing snapping up gnats

and small insects, and hunting about on the ground. At this period,
when they are searching over bunches of seeding grass, it is as much
for insect life as for seeds. Actual greenfood I find my finches rarely
eat, or if they do it is in the smallest quantities, but chickweed seed
is much appreciated. Another seed they have always before them
is maw ; I think it ought to be one of the stock seeds. I am not sure
whether the time will not come when seed hoppers and dry seed are
considered obsolete and bad practice, and seed trays with soaked or
sprouting seed take their place. Sprouting seed has certainly come
to the fore recently and, when one thinks of it, birds in a natural state
are rarely likely to find seed in the bone-dry state in which we give it
them in hoppers. It seems too much like feeding ourselves with stuff
out of tins all the time, and for a young life, whether human or avian,
the results would certainly leave much to be desired.
I can quite imagine some of my views being criticized as a counsel
of perfection ; many can no doubt speak of apparently moderately
satisfactory results from birds rather crowded in small quarters, with
little more than the seed hoppers kept filled. I would just point out
that I am concentrating on the perpetuation of aviary-bred birds,
generation after generation, and whilst aviary-bred birds which are
well reared should be in every way more desirable as stock-birds than
newly imported ones, not all by any means are, and I am hoping
that some of the points I mention may help to make just the difference
between dependence on importations, and, except for occasional new
blood, independence of them. If the importation of the Australian
Grassfinches, for instance, were stopped (and I mention them as being
considered free breeders) can we maintain virile breeding stocks of
them, or even increase them ? If not, our methods still admit of
improvement.
With the larger parrakeets it appears to be accepted that relatively
large aviaries are necessary for the raising of first-class young. Our
methods with these birds are being put to the test at the present time.
If we are pursuing our hobby successfully, and have got on the right
lines, we ought to find that aviary-bred birds of at least the more
usually bred species are produced to meet a normal demand. This
should certainly apply to the Lovebirds, Cockatiel, Eedrumps, and

possibly Rosellas, but the prices of these birds have risen considerably.
I do not know whether the demand has increased rather rapidly ;
perhaps it has, and now that the ubiquitous Budgerigar no longer
commands a high price people are turning to other Parrakeets. I hope
some such explanation is correct, otherwise we are driven to the
conclusion that the young from the wild caught birds which were in
the country when the ban was imposed are already proving, in the
first or second generation of aviary-breeding, not so virile and prolific
as their parents. I fear that because they show such a willingness to
go to nest and produce young, we sometimes take too much for
granted with birds like the Cockatiel, Redrumps, and the Lovebirds,
giving them quarters which are only fit for Budgerigars. True, with
little room, and on stale ground, they produce young which sometimes
look all right--and sometimes don't ; Lovebirds sometimes leave
the nest half feathered, but fortunately these soon grow and make
them look good stock birds. But are they proving so ?
The more seriously we take our hobby, the more we realize what
a lot is still not known, and that our methods are still empirical, even
with the species which are most commonly kept. It seems to be
accepted that, with many of the larger parrakeets and particularly
the Broadtails, close confinement (as in a cage) leads to sterility in
the male, and that cramped quarters, whilst not sufficiently bad to
prevent young being produced, have a detrimental result on the young,
some being obviously weakly or suffering from some defect. Many
of us have doubtless accepted the suggestion of the Marquess of
Tavistock that it is desirable to have an aviary 24 by 8 ft. for the
larger parrakeets. I gather from our Editor's account in the September
number that those at Keston " strike one as being on the small size ".
It would be interesting to know what size they find satisfactory, and
whether they have any information on the subsequent breeding
results of the young birds bred in these smaller aviaries. Most
people I think would agree that such birds as the Cockatiel, Redrump,
and the Lovebirds can be kept in smaller aviaries, for they certainly
can produce in small quarters young which appear nice birds. But
it is apparently the fact that the reproductive organs are more
susceptible to adverse conditions than the rest of the birds' make-up.

I purchased a few years ago a particularly fine aviary-bred Rosella
cock, good size, excellent feather, energetic, bold, and pugnacious,
but the twelve eggs his hen laid were all infertile ; with another cock
the next season every egg was fertilized. Perhaps it is exceptional
that a fine bird should be totally impotent--if may have been caged
too long after leaving the breeding aviary--but I have a feeling that
we are not always producing birds which will make satisfactory stock
birds in the young we breed--even when they are young which are
apparently sound and healthy. I doubt if there is an aviculturist
in the country to-day who can say he knows for certain that with our
present knowledge and methods he has bred even any of the birds
I have mentioned above to the fourth generation and that the fourth
generation aviary-bred birds have been just&amp;apos; as good as their wild
ancestors. I suspect that many of the birds bred to-day are not
such as would continue the race indefinitely if no wild blood were
available to bring in. In order to get data to arrive at definite
conclusions as to the results of our methods, it might be desirable, and
possible, to arrange for collaboration amongst members, with a small
committee of competent people to collate facts and draw conclusions.
If members were invited to give a list of the Parrakeets they are
breeding, or attempting to breed; whether stock are aviary-bred or
wild-caught birds ; whether in fixed or movable aviaries, and their
size, elevation above sea level, and nature of soil; details of nesting
receptacle and its location ; full details as to diet; state of weather
whilst young were being reared ; particulars as to accommodation of
independent adolescents, and any other information the committee
may find desirable ; the results of these conditions tabulated ; and the
investigation continued with the young produced, by the breeder
notifying the committee to which member birds have been sold, we
should be much more likely to reach reliable conclusions than we are
at present with members carrying on independently, some recording
their experiences, but perhaps drawing wrong inferences from
isolated occurrences and failing to appreciate all the factors of the
case ; others too modest, lazy, or busy to record them. A co-operative
plan would supply the incentive to the latter category. From the
mass of data thus obtained it is not too much to hope that safe

generalizations might be made and if in time these were then embodied
in " official recommendations " we might be spared a number of
the unsatisfactory aviary-bred birds which are to be found on the
market.
So far as I can remember, no one seems to have given any
attention to the humidity of the atmosphere in their aviary shelters
yet it may be found that for callow young it has its importance.
Perhaps if we have given it a thought at all, we have felt that the
usual British weather precludes any danger of over-dryness, but this
may not be so. Last season has been an exceptionally fine, dry
summer, ideal for foreign birds from warmer climates, one would
say. Have aviculturists found it so from their breeding results ?
The Marquess of Tavistock, writing in the October number of the
Magazine, says " 1933 has been, on the whole, rather a disappointing
season, the number of young birds reared being considerably below
the output of 1932 " and states that this was partly (but only partly)
due to breeding pairs coming to an untimely end before the season
commenced. In the August number Monsieur Decoux writes,
" The present breeding season has so far been rather good in spite
of the rainy weather." (The italics are mine.) Ought he to have
said " because of " the rainy weather ! The Marquess of Tavistock
recently wrote that he now finds it is the location of the nest that
matters with some species (if I remember rightly he was referring to
the Grass Parrakeets) and that it is hopeless to place this inside the
shelter. Let me give my experience with Kosellas this year to show
the point I am trying to make. I have two pairs and, because I am
750 feet above sea-level and in a rather bleak situation, I neither start
breeding early nor have nest-boxes in the flights. But I reason thus.
The inside of a well-constructed aviary shelter is as dry as dust, as
dry as a desert, or even drier, for there is no dew. Even in a continent
of deserts and droughts, like Australia, we find the birds are found
along the water courses or grass-banks (purely desert species excepted).
My nest-boxes are natural tree trunks, but with artificial (i.e. wooden)
tops and bottoms. Throughout the winter they have been where
natural nests would be--outside in the rain, not stored in a dry shed,
so that when placed in the aviary in spring they would not be bone

dry. Then I placed turves on the floor of the aviary and kept them
just moist, arranging for ventilation low down to prevent mould
growing. A large tray of wet soil changed often, would doubtless
give the same result, and be safer. I also sprayed the outside of the
trunk, and the wood mould forming the nest bottom, with rain water
occasionally. I aimed at producing normally dry conditions, not
the abnormally dry conditions ruling in a well-constructed shelter.
Of eight young reared every one was a really fine specimen. Perhaps
we ought all to be using wet and dry bulb thermometers in our aviaries,
ascertaining just what degree of humidity is desirable. Probably
very little is necessary, but that little may be important. In a wet
summer perhaps we need take no precautions, the humidity of the
.atmosphere being sufficient, but anyhow I think that sometimes we
do not get as good breeding results from a hot dry summer as we had
hoped, and over-dryness of the conditions of our shelters, where the
eggs and young are, may be the cause. However, a number of people
keeping careful records would soon prove whether there is anything
in the theory or not and systematic experiments by a number of people
may show that, below and above a certain range of humidity, the
young of various species are adversely affected.
[Just a digression. Has any one noticed that the Kosella has
a definite sense of smell, and uses it ? A nesting log newly placed
in the aviary is scrutinized carefully by the bird smelling it all round.
It is well known that birds generally have a very poor sense of smell
{bird photographers can ignore it altogether in their work). Perhaps
the whole genus is similarly gifted. If so, aviculture may here make
a small contribution to science, if the fact is not already recorded.]
Do our adolescents get all the accommodation they ought to have ?
It is, of course, a very important period of their lives, as it is with
all living things. With many birds it is advisable to remove the
young when they become independent; with some it is essential.
Do they then go into cages, with dry seed as sustenance, and, if so, is
it not likely to negative much of the result of the thought and care
and work that has been put into the breeding aviary. If an adult
bird requires a certain amount of space to be fit to propagate the
species, then the incarceration of a young bird at a critical period of

its physical development, from early summer until it is disposed of
in say late autumn, or given another aviary after the breeding season
is over, is surely enough to ruin or impair it for life. And yet most of
us find accommodation limited, however many aviaries we possess !
If to any one some of the above views and suggestions seem to call
for unnecessary and extreme care, I would only plead that for some
reason or reasons not yet fully known there is a considerable output
of birds which are not first-class, either through lack of sufficient
accommodation, stale ground, unsuitable or incomplete diet for callow
young, or unsuitable nesting accommodation or something else no
one has yet suspected.
Any suggestion which may seem worthy of trial ought to be
investigated. Probably the interest we have in our hobby lies partly
in its difficulties and if it were sufficient merely to coup up our birds
like fowls in a pen, throw them some food, and confidently await
results then it would lose one of its greatest charms.

The Crystal Palace show of 1934 will be remembered for its rarities
in the foreign classes. I have seen one Humming Bird before at a bird
show, but at this show there were no less than seven. Sunbirds were
represented here by nine examples belonging to seven different species.
And of Birds of Paradise there were a New Guinea Rifle Bird, an
Emperor of Germany's, a Lesser Superb, and a magnificent Lesser
Bird, all in the finest condition.
One has been led to believe that Guilding's Amazon of St. Vincent
is verging upon extinction, and here at the Palace we saw no less than
four, and all in first rate condition. There was also here a fine Racket-
tailed Parrot. I do not know what business an abnormally-coloured
Lesson's Amazon had in this class when there is a special class for
abnormalities, but there it was, and it was awarded the first prize,
Mr. Maxwell was very unfortunate in obtaining only third prize
for his magnificent pair of Banksians, the first prize going to a fine
pair of Hyacinthine Macaws and the second to a very fine Sulphur -
crested Cockatoo.

There was a lovely pair of Barrabands in Class 321, which would
have been better placed in the previous class alongside the Rock Peplar,
if only the schedule had allowed it. The lories and lorikeets and
the parrakeets were all classed together, which did not give a chance
to a very beautiful pair of Turquoisines, and some very good Bourke's,
which a few years ago we thought were gone for ever. Then I sympathize
with Mr. Patterson in only getting third for his really exquisite pair of
Swifts, which are more difficult to keep in condition than the White-
lumped Lory which beat them.
Mrs. Pearce's pair of Jambu Fruit Pigeons well deserved all they
got, and so did Mr. Patterson's Bronze-wings. There were two pairs
of Plumed Ground Doves.
The class for pheasants, ducks, and such-like was very well
supported, including a pair of Curassows, Reeves, Amherst, and Silver
Pheasants, Bahama, Mandarin, and Carolina Ducks.
The classes for Waxbills and Grassfinches were splendidly supported,
there being between twenty and thirty entries in some, which speaks
well for the interest taken in aviculture, and leads us to hope for a
little more generous classification in the future.
Amongst the rarer finches were three examples of the very rare
Twin-spotted Finches ( Hypargus margaritatus) and some of the Purple
Grenadier Waxbills that Mr. Webb recently introduced to aviculture,
also a Black-headed Waxbill ( Estrilda atricapilla), of which I believe
only one pair has ever been imported. Violet-ears and Crimson Finches
were well represented, not to mention Parrot Finches of two or three
species.
The Tanagers and Sugar Birds were very fine, and Mr. Hopkin's
Purple Sugar Bird was a perfect gem. So also were Mrs. Pearce's
Festive Tanagers and Mr. Allison's Yellow-fronted Zosterops.
Mr. Maxwell's Red-and-black Tanager was looking better than ever.
The seven Humming Birds were the stars of the show, although
I hope that Hummers will not be shown too freely, because they are
only suitable where special provision can be made for them. Here
they were in a small and specially-warmed room, but even so some
of those shown did not look too happy. The two exhibited by
Mr. Hopkins had become more or less acclimatized, and they certainly

looked very fit. The first prize went to his Ruby and Topaz, the
second to a Black-throated Mango.
The Sunbirds were lovely and looking very well one and all. There
were two Kenya Malachite, a Scarlet-chested, and a Senegal.
Starlings were a lovely show, Royal, Amethyst, and Purple-headed,
and so were the jays, Mrs. Pearce's Hunting Cissas being a most lovely
pair.
Mr. Johnson's pair of Green Toucanettes were lovely as they were
rare, and so were Mr. Heal's pair of Baillon's.
In the All Other Species classes I greatly admired Mr. Johnson's
lovely pair of White-browed Blue Flycatchers, Mrs. Pearce's wonderful
Niltava, and Mr. Ezra's White-fronted Bush Chat. Mrs. Pearce's
Golden-fronted Woodpecker was also magnificent. Space will not
allow of the mention of many other notable exhibits.

RUFOUS-TAILED OR STAR FINCHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9979360625" page_id="56219586"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
I was very interested in Mr. H. V. Highman's article on breeding Star
Finches, and as he asks for the opinion of other aviculturists on the subject
I take this opportunity of giving my experience in this direction.
My pair went to nest within a fortnight of being introduced to each other,
and like Mr. Highman's selected some tea-tree. Five eggs were laid and all
hatched but were immediately thrown out of the nest.
This, however, did not alarm me. I have found (with finches, at any
rate, in which I specialize) that when no attempt at all is made to feed them
it is usually a sign that the parents are exceedingly fit and anxious to
nest again.
So it proved in this case. Within a week another nest was completed
near the first and in due course five more eggs were laid. These all hatched
and were successfully reared.
When they had only been out of the nest a fortnight a third nest was
made and three eggs laid ; these also hatched and were reared.
Now the following points are worthy of note :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.958296" page_id="56219586"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
(1) The incubation was performed almost entirely by the male. He also
did the greater share in feeding the young.
(2) A fresh nest was built for each clutch.
(3) No soft food was used in rearing the young. Some was provided
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997401" page_id="56219586"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
for the first few days, but as it was never touched it was withdrawn.
Nevertheless every egg hatched (thirteen in all) and every chick was reared
with the exception of the first brood, where no attempt was made to feed
them (their little crops were quite empty).

(4) They--the parents--refused all insects in the shape of mealworms
and gentles.
(5) The families were reared entirely on canary, white millet (dry and

soaked), pannicum, millet sprays (soaked), and seeding grasses--principally
Tall Fescue and Poa Trivialis.
In conclusion, it appears that when two pairs belonging to the same
species behave so differently as those belonging to Mr. Highman and myself,
we have at least one of the reasons why the " golden rules " laid down by
one successful breeder are totally unsuccessful with someone else. We
must treat our birds as individuals--studying their likes and dislikes--and
not as species.

AN ABNORMAL AMAZON PARROT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991934022222222" page_id="56219587"  page_num="95" year="" vol="">
Recently I procured from a sailor an Amazon Parrot coloured differently
from any of the Amazon Parrots I have yet possessed or seen described.
After searching through all available books, I concluded that the bird was
a rarity, as no work contained a description which could be applied to the
bird. Further investigation has established that only a few birds of the
species this bird is now reputed to be have been imported within the last
century, and none exist with the coloration this bird has.
I consulted the Marquess of Tavistock, who informed me that the colora-
tion did not answer the description of any known species, but the Marquess,
with his usual enthusiasm, took the matter up with Mr. H. Whitley, who
suggested that the bird was a hen Lesson's ( Amazona lilacina ) in a lutinistic-
condition, a suggestion to which the Marquess agreed.
As there is no doubt both the Marquess and Mr. Whitley are the greatest
authorities in Europe on Parrots, I sent the bird to the latter, who confirmed
the classification which he arrived at from my written description. He
mentioned that Mr. Allan Silver had written an article on the variety some
years ago (Avicultural Magazine, Vol. XI, No. 2, February, 1920), and
Mr. Silver has verified the classification, with different coloration from the
specimen of a lilacina he had previously seen.
The following abbreviated description of Lesson's Amazon ( Amazona
lilacina) from " Parrots and Parrot-like Birds ", by the Marquess of Tavistock,
side by side with a short description of the bird under review, will illustrate in
what particulars this lutinistic specimen differs from the normal bird.

abnormal bird by brick red, and many of the green feathers by yellow,
indicating the partial absence of the blue factor.
As the bird has created a considerable amount of interest in avicultural
circles in Scotland, I have decided to exhibit it at the forthcoming " Palace "
show, where readers will have an opportunity of inspecting it.
By rather a coincidence, one of my Fischer's Lovebirds moulted last year,
heavy yellow feathers intermingled with the usual green plumage. The bird
is, and always has been, in sound condition, so this lutinistic coloration
cannot be associated with ill-health.

THE LATE MR. METZGER
As I believe I am the only member of the Avicultural Society who has
met Mr. C. T. Metzger in person, I was greatly shocked to hear of his death
in the January number of our Magazine.
While on a visit to Chicago two and a half years ago, I rang him up and
asked him to call at the hotel where I was staying, and we had a long conversa-
tion about avicultural matters. Since then I have carried on a private
correspondence with him, and I can assure members of Aviculture they
have lost a very good supporter. He worked very hard to establish the
American Magazine and also to keep it going, and members of our Society
have no idea of the difficulties he had to overcome. I am very pleased to
be able to state that he thought very highly of the help I and other members
of the English Society gave him, and he seemed to think that we English
were far in advance of any others in our knowledge of birds.
However, the great slump in the United States made the carrying on of
the Magazine more difficult than ever. As English subscribers are aware,
the Magazine improved beyond all recognition during the last twelve months,
both in the articles and in the style of print and paper.
Mr. Plath, the writer of the note regarding Mr. Metzger's death, was a
great help to Mr. Metzger, and provided him with several very good coloured
plates, as one of America's authorities on foreign birds, and I am very pleased
to read that according to Mr. Plath the Magazine is going to be carried on in
the future.

grasses and sprouted seeds are the nearest approach to this, their natural food.
How would you like to live on dried foods every day ? Ordinary seeds are
dead seeds, sprouted seeds are alive and full of vitamins, proteins and

for that you can produce up ' to 50 lb. of life-giving seeds. My ventilating
system is unique and by following my instructions I guarantee success. The
stove burns for three weeks with no attention, and it is fireproof. Scores
have been sold already. I have been experimenting for over two years, and
this appliance is the result of those experiments.
You can order with perfect confidence and any members not more than
delighted will have their cash refunded without question upon receipt of the

It is built of extra heavy galvanized steel, no solder is used and the perforated

that is why there is none in the " Brodlans " Sprouter.

CAPTURING WATERFOWL IN AFRICA
By Ronald Stevens
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99926085" page_id="56219599"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
For some considerable time my brother and I had long cherished
the thought of adding some of Africa's interesting duck to our collection
of waterfowl and, as it is extremely difficult to import these birds in
the ordinary way, one of us decided to go out and get them.
Accordingly in March, 1933, I started my rather unique hunt in
Northern Zululand. On a previous visit to Lake St. Lucia in 1922,
there were, at that time, countless thousands of duck. Now, I dis-
covered, the flocks were but a memory. People who knew the lake
informed me that the duck had gone with the disappearance of the
reed beds which, in those earlier days, used to form a wide margin to
the water.
That fascinating country between the Pongola and the Portuguese
border always had a good reputation for duck, so I turned my steps
thither.
Otobotini is a good centre for exploring Tongaland, and here I
enjoyed a few days with Mr. and Mrs. Rutherfoord. Mr. Rutherfoord
is an observant sportsman, and was able to give me valuable informa-
tion. He told me that I had come at the wrong time, but if I would
return in August there would be abundance of duck. Excursions to
local pans and the confirmation of natives proved that he was right.

There were no duck to be seen except a few Yellowbill and White-faced
Tree Duck.
By the end of March I was in Durban again with the knowledge
that the waterfowl of Africa were evidently migratory. Reports
received from many parts of the Union confirmed this, so now there
were only two courses open to me. I could wait until August when
the duck would return, or I could go at once to wherever they had
migrated. I decided on the latter course, but soon found myself
in difficulty again as no one could tell me where the fowl had gone.
Providentially, however, I received a letter from my friend Mr. A. F.
Moody, the author of Game Birds and Waterfowl in Captivity. He
had heard from a friend in Northern Rhodesia who informed him
that duck abounded in the shallows of the Kafue River. Putting
two and two together from further perusal of the letter, I concluded that
they would be up there at that moment. I decided to go.
By 1st May I had motored the seventeen hundred miles between
Durban and the marsh where I was then camped. After seeing the
hundreds of acres of barren water in the south, it was a gladdening
sight to see the vast flocks of fowl which were here. There were Yellow-
bill, Fulvous, and White-faced Tree Duck, Red-billed Pintail, Cape
Pochard, Hottentot Teal, Knobnosed Duck, and Spurwinged Geese.
After I had caught Redbill, Pochard, and Knobnosed Duck, not to
mention innumerable Tree Duck and Yellowbill which were not required,
it soon became evident that the first two species were obtainable as
young birds, as the natives soon hunted them up and brought the
ducklings into camp. So much the better, as hand-reared duck are
always preferable to adult wild-caught birds ; they not only become
tame in a much shorter time, but nearly always breed in captivity,
which the wild-caught adults are very reluctant to do.
Unfortunately, I had arrived unwittingly at the end of the breeding
season. The beautiful little Hottentot Teal had bred earlier, its young
were all on the wing now, and nothing would induce them to go into
the traps so carefully set for them. According to notes I had gathered
previously from books, I ought to have been in time for catching
young birds still incapable of flight, but the natives declared that
they bred in December and January. Later, five adults were caught

in zebra-hair nooses, but they all came to an untimely end. One
hung itself, three escaped with some Pochard and Knobnosed when
cattle broke into the pen during my absence afterwards, and the
survivor met its fate in an accident, of which more anon.
In due course all the young birds were successfully reared, and I
thought it time to move on to another part of the country to try for
other species. I was advised to go farther north so prepared accordingly.
Unfortunately this Land of Promise transpired to be Native Keserve.
The Provincial Commissioner pointed out to me politely but firmly
that no visitor had ever been allowed to enter this territory and that
no exception could be made in my case. He was most vigorously
supported by the District Commissioner. I was further informed that
there was only one man in the country who had the power to give me
permission and that was the Governor himself. So I decided to apply
to His Excellency who was expected in the district in a few weeks'
time. It meant the loss of at least a month's valuable time and the
probability of having to give up all hope of catching any young
birds, but there was really no other course open as conditions in other
parts of the continent were unknown to me and to everyone
I met.
To fill in the time of waiting I decided to visit another pan outside
the Reserve, and was actually en route when I met a pioneer of the
country who persuaded me to return to the pan I had already visited.
He said it was the best pan outside the Reserve, certainly better
than the one which I had then intended visiting. His advice was
much appreciated. Fortunately, the site of my former campaign was
not very far distant, and I thought that if I could catch some more
Pochard and some Hottentot a revisit would be well worth while.
On arrival at the now familiar surroundings I soon discovered,
to my horror, that the duck were not so numerous as before. Further,
the water was drying up. Traps were built in feverish haste, but no
Pochard were caught as there were few about, and the Hottentot
were as disdainful as usual. The only captures were twenty Knobnosed
which, besides being the least required among the desiderata, were all
immature drakes and so useless to me. These disappointing days
of receding water and vanishing flocks were, if I had but known, a

reflection on the changing conditions which were than taking place
over the whole of Northern Rhodesia.
After returning to civilization and some further waiting I at length
had the honour of being presented to the Governor, His Excellency
Sir Ronald Storrs, who was kind enough not only to take a great interest
in my mission but to give me the long-sought-for permission to enter
the Native Reserve.
I had heard of a marvellous lake fed by hot springs which was
reputed to be a duck's paradise and, what was most important, it
was believed to be covered with duck at that time of the year when
they were scarce everywhere else. So I decided that this lake should
be my first destination in the Reserve, and headed for it towards the
end of June. On arrival, however, my dreams of hordes of duck which
were waiting to walk into my traps were rudely shattered. There
was not a single duck to be seen ! The natives said the fowl had
swarmed on the lake until just recently, but now they were gone, and
would not return until November when the rains commenced. They
said there was another lake some miles away where possibly duck
still lingered, so my boys and I trekked over there with a local guide.
However, that sheet of water was as barren as the first.
I felt forced to the conclusion now that it was the same all over
Northern Rhodesia, if not the whole of Central Africa. A general
migratory movement had apparently set in, and the sooner I cleared
out after the departed hosts the better. By the time it would be
possible to return to Zululand the fowl should be there in numbers,
according to what I had previously learned. At any rate, it seemed
something on which to work.
However, when I reported at the Boma and announced my intention
of leaving the Reserve, the District Commissioner, Mr. Gordon Reed,
the same gentleman who had so much opposed my entry, now most
generously persuaded me to try again in another direction. Two of
his native boys reported duck in the north-east, so I decided to make
another attempt. Mr. Reed kindly gave me two boys who knew
the country and would be useful in introducing me to the chiefs.
At the time I thought Mr. Reed's magnanimity and helpfulness a good
omen for a turn of fortune, but though I shall always have him to

thank for that highly interesting trip, I am afraid the results, as far
as the duck were concerned, were absolutely nil. Yellowbill and Tree
Duck were there in plenty, but none of the required species.
It seemed useless going any farther, and I felt very disappointed,
but before returning to Durban I decided to try to find out what
the neighbouring country of Nyasaland had to offer, so telegraphed--
" What months constitute the breeding season for Nyasaland Duck.
Are young birds on water now ? " This was the end of July. I was
quite prepared to go on another six or seven hundred miles to Nyasaland
on receipt of a favourable reply but, as none came after waiting several
days, I started the long journey back to Durban with twenty Red-
billed Pintail, six Pochard, and one Hottentot Teal. All fine
conditioned, tame, and hand-reared birds except the Hottentot, which
was wild caught.
When in the Transvaal and motoring by night, my boy missed a
sudden turning in the road, with the result that we went bounding
off into the veldt and the car overturned ! Already frail, after its
months of hard wear, the car was almost completely smashed and
all the duck were crushed to death ! Thus was the result of four
months' work, travel, and expense in Northern Rhodesia nullified in
a moment ! However, it might easily have been worse as neither
my Zulu driver nor myself received the slightest scratch.
Arrived in Durban again, I found a forwarded telegram from
Nyasaland--" Yes, young birds on water now therefore advise your
coming immediately." Too late. I was now committed for Zululand.
There followed soon after a forwarded letter from a friend who had
recently returned from Ulendo in the Loangwa Valley of Northern
Rhodesia. He wrote that he had been camping by a lake where the
duck, according to native report, bred in July, and recommended
my going there at once ! Truly the duck migrations and breeding
seasons of Africa is a study calculated to mystify an ornithologist.
Before starting for Zululand I decided to test information I had
gathered from a certain book with regard to the breeding of Cape
Teal and Black Duck in the Cape Province in July and August. The
best districts were visited but without enthusiasm, for how could duck
be-expected to. breed in such-cold with early morning ice-on the water ?

It was then the end of July--midwinter in South Africa----and the
Cape winter is not to be scoffed at when degrees Farenheit are con-
cerned, particularly at night! The book referred to was written j
about thirty years ago, and I was told that the Cape winters had
become noticeably colder since then. However, I did see some Cape
Teal, Black Duck, and Cape Shelduck, which was some compensation
for travelling twelve hundred miles on that journey.
Before starting the Zululand trip I took a run up to make a pre-
liminary survey of the best pans to work, and to find out what species
of duck were available before coming to any decision with regard to .
methods of trapping and obtaining permits. I found duck in tens
of thousands on the pans in the Ndumu country. About half of them
were Tree Duck, but still there were plenty of Red bill, Pochard, Dwarf
Geese, White-backed Duck, and a few Hottentot. On Tete Pan I
saw my first and only pair of Cape Shoveller. Then I hurried back to
Durban and was busy for nearly a fortnight making preparations.
On this last trek I was fortunate in having the company of my
friend, Mr. Harold Millar, the well-known South African ornithologist,
entomologist, and botanist. When we arrived in the duck country
we were disappointed to find that all the Whitebacks had gone, but
we were soon compensated by catching thirteen beautiful Dwarf
Geese. Although awkward on land these little birds proved them-
selves able gymnasts, and it was through their climbing their wire-
netting enclosure that we lost one. Then we caught twenty Redbills
and then, unhappily, Mr. Millar got fever, and as he became seriously
ill we had to break up the trip.
By 16th November last 1 was on a homeward-bound boat with
eight Cape Shelduck, which I had bought from farmers, two Knob-
nosed Duck from the Pretoria Zoo, twenty Red-billed Pintail, and
ten Dwarf Geese, two, unfortunately, having died. It had taken
nearly a year to get these birds, and it had been a wonderful experience.
I wish I were starting all over again with the knowledge which I
now have.
The kindness and hospitality which South Africans so freely give
to visitors from overseas greatly added to the pleasure of the trip,
and I shall always feel grateful to the officials for their helpfulness.

It was an extremely cold day when we arrived at Southampton
on 11th December, and the journey up to Worcestershire was too
much for one of the Dwarf Geese which died. They are undoubtedly
delicate, but by carefully acclimatizing them it is possible that our four
remaining pairs, which, up to the time of writing, have kept in splendid
condition, will eventually prove to be as hardy as their near relative
the Indian Cotton Teal, which seems to stand our winters well out
of doors, and, having attained hardiness, we hope that Nettapus
auritus will reproduce its kind for the enjoyment of those who could
not wish for anything more beautiful on ornamental waters.
THE NESTING OF MACAWS AT LILFORD
By A. F. Moody
Reference in our Magazine has on more than one occasion been
made of the Parrots which we have at liberty at Lilford.
For some years past these have included three Red and Yellow
Macaws (Ara chloroptera). These beautiful birds are a proved pair
and a supposed odd female. For several seasons the pair have
interested themselves in certain hollow cavities of trees, etc., but
beyond being spiteful to the odd bird, and showing a tendency to
drive strange humans from the neighbourhood of the selected spot,
nothing further has happened.
In May, 1933, they seriously decided to nest, by taking
possession of a hollow cavity near the top of a very tall and partly
decayed elm tree. In this cavity the female disappeared for some
weeks, and it was only by watching the male going to feed her that
we had an inkling how matters were progressing, and that the
female was still in the land of the living. Considerable anxiety was
felt at this period for fear the female should be exhausting herself
by sitting too long upon clear eggs. Matters had reached this
climax when the bird in question relieved the situation by suddenly
* reappearing, and the broken shells of clear eggs were then discovered
beneath the tree.
Within ten days of this occurrence ^ 13th July), the female had

A. F. Moody--The Nesting of Macaws
again disappeared, and, we rightly concluded, had laid a second
clutch of eggs. After some weeks, rather than allow the bird to
continue sitting, we decided to investigate. No ladder long enough
for the purpose being available, the fire escape was commandeered,
and fully expanded to its 50 rungs, rested against the tree. Even
this necessitated a climb of about 9 ft. to the nest. After a struggle
with the parents, three beautiful, but clear white, eggs were
removed. These were somewhat pointed, not so round as the eggs
of the Blue and Yellow Macaw, and with considerably more polish
than the eggs of that species laid here.
With a view to avoiding the necessity of again scaling this very
tall, and, from its decayed state, dangerous tree, the entrance to
the cavity was securely blocked with stout wire netting. Not satisfied
with their two attempts at breeding, the birds, a few days later,
circumvented our precaution by forcing another entrance into the
nesting cavity, and, as events proved, laid one, or probably a third,
full clutch of three eggs. Owing to the dangerous nature of the
tree, we felt that nothing further could be done, and it was decided
to let matters take their course, relying upon the male keeping the
hen well nourished and upon their natural instinct to discard the
eggs if bad.
The possibility of young was, of course, considered, nevertheless
it came as a surprise when a young bird descended from the nest
during the night, or early morning, of 19th December. News of
this was brought me by an assistant, who said the Macaws had been
fighting, and that a damaged bird had been picked up under the
nesting tree, and put into a warm shed.
On going to view the invalid, I was surprised to find a young
bird, which greeted me with the Macaw's usual croak, and as far
as first impressions went, differed only from the adults in having
a decidedly smaller bill, and the black of the under mandible not
so pronounced (more grey). The parents had free access to this
youngster, and hopes were entertained that it would be fed.
Unfortunately, however, it died within two days, and as a sub-
sequent autopsy proved, from an internal injury, no doubt received
in its descent from the nest.

No further young have been seen, and our one consolation in
this most unfortunate occurrence, is the certain knowledge that we
now possess a true pair. Further, that if an earlier clutch of
eggs should prove fertile in 1934, there are reasonable grounds for
hoping that, with luck, the young may be successfully reared.

SOME NOTES ON THE BREEDING OF
BULLFINCHES IN CAPTIVITY

By Gerald de Pass
It is now a good many years since I commenced to keep Bull-
finches, but I have had them on and off ever since I was a boy. It
is, however, only during the last few years that I have been in a
position to keep them in outdoor aviaries. It was not long before
I decided I must try an.d breed them, and I was told that it was
practically impossible to breed and rear them with the hen Bullie
herself, and that to do so I must put the eggs under Canaries to
hatch and rear, if I wanted any results. All this made me still
keener to try and to succeed, if possible. My first season was not
very successful; I got as far as getting eggs, but they did not hatch.
I commenced with two pairs, both in the same aviary, as at that
time I only had the one aviary. This is where I made my first
mistake, as, although the aviary had both indoor and outside
flights, the two cocks did nothing but chase each other about. My
two pairs of Bullies consisted of one wild-caught cock, ar&gt;d one
hand-reared cock that was caught as a baby in the fruit nets the
year before by my gardener, and I hand-reared him myself. Both
hens were wild-caught. The wdld-caught cock and his wife lived
and built in the outside flight, but the hen was such a bad
nest-builder that all her eggs fell straight on to the ground and
were smashed. The other pair lived more or less in the inside
part of the aviary, and, finally, the hen built in a Canary travelling
cage with the top and side removed. She made a much better job

of her nest, and duly laid four eggs and then sat her full time.
Owing, I think, to the other cock always chasing her husband about
(he was an older bird), the eggs proved unfertile. This was the end
of my first year's efforts.
During the following winter I lost the old cock and his
hen, which left me with only the other pair. Early in the
following May I saw the hen was commencing to carry bits of grass,
etc., about, so I broke up some thin sticks for her, and also got
some of the bundles of nesting material sold for Canaries, and
some hay and feathers, and gave them to her. She very soon built
a beautiful nest in a box-tree and then laid three eggs. She sat
beautifully, and whilst she was sitting the cock fed her on the nest
and I used to watch him hovering and catching what, I presume,
must have been flies for her. On the thirteenth day I put a few
live mealworms, some live ants' eggs and soft food into the aviary,
and had to curb my impatience and wait, and try and catch the
hen off the nest. However, I am nearly certain that the hen never
leaves the nest for the first 48 hours or so.- Mr. Bullie appears to
eat nearly the whole day, and then regurgitates the food to
Mrs. Bullie, who, in her turn, feeds the young ones. Bullies are
hatched completely naked, and I imagine they must require a lot
of heat to keep them alive, and this, I think, is the reason why
the hen Bullie does not leave the nest to commence with. The nest
is kept most beautifully clean all the time. The young ones leave
the nest in about 18 to 20 days and at first seem unable to fly
much and, in my case, hid in the grass. I used to hide and watch,
and the cock would call, and the young would come out of the grass
to be fed. The parents continue to feed them for about 14 days,
but before the 14 days are up the hen commences to build another
nest, and the cock does all the feeding. The first nest only produced
one young one, and the second only two. The young are
exactly like the hen, until they have moulted out in the autumn.
I am sorry to say I lost all but one young one in the moult. This
was a cock, but he died in a fit during the next spring, and before
his hen had commenced to build. I find aviary-bred Bullies are
smaller than the wild ones, and al^o much more difficult to get

through the moult. I lost the old hen during the winter, owing,
I believe, to my still giving them mealworms. Bullies, being very
greedy, overeat themselves if given an opportunity. I now only
give them mealworms when they have young ones, or else as a
treat. I managed to get another hen in the following May, and by
great good fortune she took to the cock at once, and soon had a
nest in some gorse branches. She hatched and reared four young
ones in the first nest, and hatched four and reared three young
ones in the second nest. I lost four young ones during the moult,
and I believe they were nearly all hens. Hens I find much more
difficult to keep than cocks.
The following summer I had some more aviaries, and so
had two pairs put up for breeding, the old pair and a young
pair. The old hen went to nest very early, and, although
she laid, she would not sit. In May she built another nest,
and laid and commenced to sit, but unfortunately I found her
dead on the floor about a week before the eggs should have hatched.
The other pair built and laid, but the eggs were all taken and
smashed by field mice; I think owing to the wire netting being
 |mesh instead of Jin. I moved them into another aviary, and they
nested and hatched successfully, but something pulled the young
ones out of the nest and bit their feet off, and I had to destroy
them. Although my gardener and I both searched all round the
aviary, we could never find where anything got in. This year I
hope to try with three or more pairs. I am sure half the trouble
with Bullies is to get the cocks to fertilize the eggs, and I think
one must have aviary- or hand-reared birds to do it, but I intend
trying a wild cock this season as an experiment. Hens are far less
trouble to get to nest, but, personally, I much prefer small and
slightly built hens to big and heavy ones. My feeding for adult
birds is canary, best Rubsen rape, and a little hemp, and in very
cold weather I add linseed. When feeding young, I give more
hemp, mealworms, live ants' eggs, fruit, soft food, berries, etc. I
give mealworms four or five times a day, commencing before
breakfast. As Bullies are naturally shy birds, quiet is very
necessary. The cocks are also very jealous, and it is useless to try and

breed if two cocks can see each other, as they will spend all their
time trying to fight. Hens also vary very much in temperament,
and some are much easier to manage than others. I believe these
birds have been bred in a cage in Germany, and I have seen a
hen sitting in a cage in London, but I don't think the eggs hatched.
It is to be hoped that now the Buckmaster Bill has been passed
that more people will try and breed our native Finches, as I am
sure it can be done, and I think one gets just as much interest and
enjoyment from breeding them as from breeding rare foreign birds,
which are beyond the reach of a lot of us.

By R. B. Minchin.
I should like to record the fact in the Magazine that four Scarlet-
chested Grass Parrakeets were reared in this Society's Gardens this
season. We started with two pairs and about 20th July, 1933, one
of the hens began to incubate eight eggs. After three days she left
the log and took no more interest in incubation so the eggs were removed
and placed under four hen Budgerigars. Seven of these eventually
hatched but the young died one by one until all were lost. They were
certainly not starved and no theory can be advanced for their death
unless it was that their foster parents left them at night, perhaps being
frightened off the nest by their unnatural charges.
During the first week in August the hen began to lay again, but
on the 7th she became egg-bound with the third egg, and although
it was laid the following day, she became gradually weaker and died
on 9th August.
The second pair did not come into breeding condition until later
in the season and it was not till 4th September that the cock was
seen feeding the hen. They were immediately givep seed treated with

cod-liver oil--one teaspoon of oil to a pint of seed. Logs had been
hung against the wall in a nearly upright position, thus :--
A few inches of earth was placed in the bottom of the logs and
a small hole bored several inches from the top to act as an entrance.
They chose a log hanging outside, the measurement of which was
30 inches long with an internal diameter of 5J inches. It was some
time before the female eventually began to sit and young were heard
squeaking in the nest on 3rd November. A week later the hen was
spending quite a lot of time off the nest in obtaining food for the off-
spring, but the cock was rarely seen to feed them, but frequently assisted
by passing food on to the hen for due delivery to the nestlings. At this
stage the birds had such a craving for green seeding grass that they
would readily alight on a bunch held in the hand, but otherwise they
were not particularly tame. The first youngster left the nest thirty -
three days after hatching on 6th December, and the remaining three
appeared on 9th December.
Whilst feeding their young the birds were given their ordinary
diet consisting of equal parts of canary and white millet seed, but of
course their allowance of green seeding grass was considerably increased.
The young resemble the female but males can usually be distin-
guished by their slightly superior size and by the fact that the blue
of the face is brighter than that on the female.
The father of these birds was taken from the nest last season and
reared by hand. On arriving here there were several scarlet spots on
the bird's chest and their total area would not have been greater than
that of a shilling. Compared with fully coloured males I should say
that the scarlet on the chest will increase by at least 25 per cent, so it
is quite evident that more than a year must elapse before they are
fully coloured.
We are fortunate at the moment in being able to exhibit in the
Adelaide Zoological Gardens all the species of Grass Parrakeets except
the Orange-bellied, and even this bird we hope to possess before long.

By C. H. Heal
I have very little time to devote to the most interesting part of
Aviculture, namely, the breeding of rare birds in captivity. My
aviaries, therefore, are quite simple affairs, constructed mainly for
the purpose of giving the birds the benefit of the summer out of
doors.
It was in May last that I turned a pair of the Bahia Passerine
Parrotlet (Forpus passerina vivida ) into one of these aviaries (only
8 by 6 by 3 feet), together with various Lovebirds, large
Chats, and Tanagers. I decided it would be useless to attempt to
breed any of these birds in such an unnatural place, but in order
to make the aviary look as ornamental as possible, I hung up two
or three husks.
One day in August last the hen Parrotlet disappeared, but after
searching some time, the bird was discovered in one of the husks.
I was naturally very anxious to see what was happening inside, but
common sense prevailed, and I did not disturb the bird. As far as
I know, the hen never left the husk for 29 days, and was fed by
the cock Parrotlet the whole time. He would put to flight birds
three times his own size when they approached the nest, and one
can imagine the busy time he had providing for his wife and five
bonny youngsters. The young Parrotlets must have been nearly
a fortnight old before the hen decided to leave the nest and take
over part of the feeding. The floors of my aviaries are made of
concrete, but in spite of this, the rearing of these birds was a very
simple matter. As soon as I thought young birds might be in the
nest, I supplied sunflower, canary, Italian and Indian millet,
together with green food. Everything was refused except sunflower
seed and lettuce, and although I believe Lord Tavistock does not
recommend sunflower for small Parrot-like birds, I can say
definitely these birds were reared solely on sunflower seed and

Situated right in the middle of the Irish Sea, the Isle of Man is
a most favourable spot in which to observe bird life, especially in
the Spring and Autumn migrations. Colonel Madoc, Chief Constable
of the island, is most fortunately a very keen bird-lover, and his
book, admirably written, is the result of the requests of his friends
to put into permanent form the many records of observations made
" in sunshine and rain, cold and warmth, out in the open spaces
amid wild surroundings, and away from all worries and troubles
The author does not claim any distinction as an ornithologist,
though his readers will vote him one of the best type; he is moreover
a most careful observer, and has made the best use possible of the
unique situation in which he has found himself. His book is
delightfully written, not a mere record of the names of the species
noted (there is not a scientific name in the book), but an account,
from his own personal observations, of the habits of each kind. To
those who know the island, the book will make a special appeal,
but even to others, so long as they are interested in wild British
birds, it will prove of much interest. It is illustrated with twelve
excellent photographic plates.

The death of Mr. Meade-Waldo, in his 80th year, which took
place at his residence, Stonewall Park, Edenbridge, Kent, on
Saturday, 24th February, has removed from our midst one of the
oldest members of the Avicultural Society, and one of the keenest
nature-lovers in the world. Born in Ireland in 1855, he was
educated at Eton and Magdalene College, Cambridge. From his
earliest youth and throughout his long life Meade-Waldo had taken
the greatest interest in natural history. In his younger days he
travelled much, and although never a keen collector of specimens,
he did, at the request of the Natural History Museum, make several
valuable discoveries of new birds in the Atlas Mountains. At one
time he kept a number of live birds in captivity, especially the
rarer Owls, and he bred Sand Grouse ( Pterocles alchatus and P .
exustus), Desert Bullfinches ( Bucanetes githaginea amantium), the
Teydean Chaffinch ( Fringilla teydese ), the Nicobar Pigeon
(Calcenas nicobaricse ), Scops Owl ( Otus scops), and many other
species. But it is perhaps as a bird protectionist that Meade-Waldo
will be best remembered. He was never opposed to the keeping
of birds in captivity, but never spared his efforts to prevent the
destruction of rare species or to save those in danger of extinction.
He was an energetic member of the Zoological Society, which he
joined in 1874, and served on its Council for many years, a member
and keen supporter of the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds, the Society for the Preservation of the Fauna of the Empire,
and the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves. Mr. Meade-
Waldo suffered a severe shock by the death, in January, 1933, of
his almost life-long friend, Mr. Herbert St. Quintin, with whom
he was accustomed to correspond almost daily, and to many of his
friends it seemed that he had never been quite the same since. But
up to the last he continued to take the keenest interest in the
subject to which he had devoted his life. He will be greatly missed
by all who knew him.

A CURIOUS BUDGERIGAR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991535577777778" page_id="56219618"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
This morning I have had the pleasure, a very great pleasure, of visiting the
aviaries and caged birds of Mr. A. Maag, of Green Point, Capetown.
Mr. Maag--a well-known and respected business man at Capetown--has
a truly wonderful cock Budgerigar, one of such peculiar markings that
one wonders what coloration and markings will eventually be stabilized
in Budgerigars. Here is my description of what I call a Mottled or Marbled
Budgerigar. It is three years old and a cock. Ground colour of
bird throughout rich yellow--deeper than a primrose or daffodil yellow--
mottled upon chest, belly, and beneath tail with green.
Head, back, and wings deeply but unevenly mottled with black edgings to
feathering, giving the bird a richly mottled or marbled appearance.
Cere is so light in colour as to leave even experts doubtful as to sex, but
its sex has been proved by mating for it is the sire of, when mated to an
unrelated green hen, a yellow cock and two yellow hens ; a green cock and
two green hens.
This produce shows no signs of exceptional coloration, excepting one green
hen, which shows a tinge of yellow mottling on breast.
Although the cere is so light in. colour, the cheek patches are of deep
cobalt, the left side cheek patch being suffused with white patches. It has
very dark eyes but is what dog-fanciers term wall-eyed, its right eye being
broken in colour. Its left eye is a dark black brown colour.
Tail feathering: one clear yellow ; one green edged with black ; others
broken yellow and green edged with black. Legs and feet light flesh colour,
with all toe-nails tipped with black.
This bird was bred here in Capetown by an amateur bird fancier having
no knowledge whatever of pedigree breeding. It was bred from two greens.
Its present owner, Mr. Albert Maag, is an enthusiastic breeder. He has three
of the most perfect whites yet seen in the adult Budgerigar. They certainly do,
upon close examination, show a slight bluish tinge at the juncture of back and
tail, but one has to look for it to find it. Mr. Maag's birds, or at least three of
them, are of a much purer white than anything I have seen exhibited in
England. He is also an ardent disciple of Mendel and it is lucky therefore that
this wonderful marbled bird has come into his possession.
Just how he will pair him up is at present doubtful. I advised pairing
the bird back to his daughters and Mr. Maag has also a deep leaning this way.
Upon the other hand, he also fancies the mating of an almost pure white hen.
One or other of these matings will materialize and I am certain all British
Budgerigar breeders will wish Mr. Maag the best of luck.

P.S.--Mr. Maag is also the fortunate possessor of a charmingly tame
talking Budgie. This bird he keeps in his bedroom in a roller cage at night.
This bird speaks most clearly and also whistles a well-known London street-
whistle. There are several talking Budgies in Capetown.

WHITE-CAPPED PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98502315" page_id="56219619"  page_num="115" year="" vol="">
It may be worth recording that my White-capped Parrots (Pionus senilis)
appear perfectly hardy and have passed through the winter up to the present
in an outdoor aviary without artificial heat. They make no use of the shelter
except to roost in. Possibly their indifference to cold may be explained by
the unusual quantity of down the species seems to have in its plumage. In
regard to voice they are the quietest Parrots I have ever come across,
apparently possessing no loud calls at all. A single bird would probably
become attached to its owner, but my pair are anything but amiable towards
human beings, the cock, especially, cherishing a life ambition to bite me
severely before I have finished putting in fresh food ! Even if he sees one at
a distance he ruffles his feathers and makes an angry lunge with his beak just
to show what he would like to do to one if he got the chance !
I notice that in addition to the plumage differences noted in a previous
article, there is a sexual distinction in the colour of the eye. The iris of the
cock is of a uniform very dark brown, but the hen's iris has an outer circle of
a very much paler and yellower colour.
If all the Pioni are as hardy as P. senilis they would possess distinct
merits as aviary birds, as some species, notably the Blue-headed, Violet, and
Bronze-winged Parrots, are decidedly pretty.

building about September and sitting many weeks on unfertile eggs. This last
year, 1933, they went to nest and had two young, one dying and the second
leaving the nest and growing up. This I wrote to you about. Just after my
letter was printed they had a further family of four, two cocks and two hens,
all growing into fine strong birds. They used the canary rearing food with
avidity--egg and biscuit, and bread and milk. Almost daily I dug out ants'
nests bringing the whole lot up to them and putting it on the bird-room floor.
They generally left the ants, and they very conveniently camped under sods
and laid further eggs.
By the autumn I had seven Cordons. I do not know if any one else has
succeeded in rearing them in a room. I should be most interested to know.
They have a nest now, but I do not think the eggs are fertile. I have
found no fighting between the cocks so far.

A HYBRID SILVER AND GOLDEN PHEASANT
A hybrid bred from a cock Silver Pheasant (Gennceus nycthemerus) and a
hen Golden Pheasant (Crysolophus pictus) has been bred by Lieut.-Colonel
Bailey, at Lake House, Salisbury.
While hybrids have been produced between many different species of
Pheasants, often belonging to different genera, that between the two above-
mentioned is very uncommon, if not unique.

BREEDING THE GUIANA PARROTLET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993445" page_id="56219620"  page_num="116" year="" vol="">
The most interesting event of the 1933 breeding season in my aviaries
was the breeding of Guiana Parrotlet,
These miniature parrots I find quite peaceful with small finches, but
very spiteful towards any other of the parrot-like family. Had I not removed
them from one aviary they would have been the death of a pair of Fischus
Lovebirds.
The nest-box used was the upright pattern budgerigar box. Four eggs
were laid, three hatched but died at three or four days old. Noticing a strong
musty smell I put the nest-box out in the open: before doing so, I fixed a
block of wood 3i in. square to the bottom and arranged a tin about
6 in. square so that the block stood in water and provided a certain
amount of dampness to the nest.
The second round, again, four eggs were laid, three hatched ; two young
reared to maturity and again they went to nest this time rearing three.
As regards feeding, the young were fed almost entirely on spray millet and
green food, the staple food being canary, Indian and white millet, sunflower,
and a little hemp. All live food was refused.
Wishing you and the Society the best of health and luck for 1934.
Thos. Pembleton.

I have a little Canary-winged Parrakeet in a cage in my dining-room
and late this autumn the little bird got very seedy, in fact it looked as if it
was just going to die. It had ceased to take an interest in anything and sal-
on its perch shivering with head under wing. It was in a miserably poor
condition with feathers all wrong. It looked to one as if it wanted some
nourishing food besides the dry seeds that these birds eat, so every evening
I made up a dessert-spoonful of creamy milk with a little fruit juice, such
as apple or plum or anything that was going. The bird took an interest in
this at once and even the next day there was a decided improvement. I kept
on with this diet every evening and in a short time the Parrakeet was as
lively and as noisy as ever. I am certain when I took the matter in hand the
bird had only a day or two to live. I now give it this milk food three or four
times a week, it seems to thrive on it.

Is it not high time that the Members of the Avicultural Society and the
Fellows of the Zoological Society joined forces and approached the Govern-
ment with a view to having this wretched restriction repealed. Surely between
the two societies pressure could be brought to bear on the powers that be ?
It is high time that something was done to reverse what was really a newspaper
stunt with, I presume, the Buckmaster crowd in the background. Now
that we are to lose the chance of getting British birds for our aviaries perhaps
as a quid pro quo we might be allowed to purchase in our shops Parrots,
Parrakeets, and Lovebirds as heretofore. It is simply a monstrous thing
that the liberty of the subject is being interfered with at every turn and
yet we are never done boasting about British Freedom ! I understand that

Belgium has repealed their " Parrot Act " and that it has become practically
a dead letter in France. I am convinced that nothing will be done by
sitting quiet and letting ourselves be bullied by permanent Government officials
and certain societies which are well known for their interference with our
fascinating hobby. In conclusion I may say I am speaking from some
very recent experiences of this kind of thing. We have just had a Government
Inquiry in this City because the Corporation wanted to borrow a few thousand
pounds to start an attractive Zoo in one of our public parks. This was
bitterly opposed by the local branch of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals who forced the Corporation into the expense of a
Public Government Inquiry. Fortunately this narrow-minded society was
thoroughly beaten and Belfast is to have its Zoo in spite of them.

Mr. G. Bradshaw, of Sydney, Australia, writes that, within the past few

He suggests that publishers might advertise such books in the Magazine.

THE BLUE-AND-YELLOW MACAW

I am very much interested in the Blue-and-yellow Macaws Mr. Goodfellow
writes about in the December Magazine. The British Museum Catalogue
gives ararauna and caninde, the latter 1 inch longer in body. I have
a description of A. caninde as under, but I am not sure where I copied it from.
[Cat. B. Brit. Mus., vol. xx, p. 152 .--Ed,]
" Very like A. ararauna, but the forehead with no greenish tinge ; the
naked skin of the cheeks much reduced, and surrounded by a broad green
band, which covers the whole of the throat, the feather lines on the lores and
upper part of the cheeks more numerous, and of a lighter green like the
throat."
I have been looking for this Macaw for years and have never seen one.
Will Mr. Goodfellow tell us if he thinks this was the bird he had ? There
are two Green Macaws which are confused, militaris and ambigua. Dr. Green
said the only difference was in size. I have had both and compared them side
by side ; without doubt they are very different in colour as well as size.

WHITE-NECKED OR TROPICAL CROWS IN KENYA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994420146341463" page_id="56219622"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
The birds we have are hand-reared, and are allowed to run loose round
the house, roosting at night in a wire and thatch hut. Their wings have been
clipped, but they can fly sufficiently to get up a small tree. We have not
liked to try allowing them their full flight, as occasionally wild Crows swoop
down and call to ours, and try to lure them away. These Crows, which are
scientifically known as Corvus scapulatus or alhus, are about the size of
Jackdaws and are striking looking, with their white collars and chests. The
rest of the feathers are blue black and glossy. They are clever fielders,
and catch small pieces of bread (they like it buttered) with a loud snap of
their bills. They make a variety of curious and amusing sounds. They
gurgle and caw softly, then loudly, and in different tones, and some combina-
tions of sound almost like words ; but I have never heard them imitate,
although they might if kept apart. With their feathers fluffed up, heads
on one side, and wings spread out, they gurgle and caw to each other--and
sometimes to one of us humans. If we are sitting quietly in the verandah
they will sit on a chair-back within a foot or two and gurgle away just as
they do to each other. At 11 a.m. they have their bath, preen themselves, then
chase with their funny hops the chickens and dogs, whose tails they twitch
if they get near enough. They examine and turn everything over, throw
things about, and even quite heavy things are dragged off tables and shelves
and, if light enough, carried outside and thrown away.
They can fill their pouches with food, which they sometimes bury in the
flower beds. I think they are quite carnivorous and suspect them of having
dispatched a lame Dove which was hopping around one day. They certainly
eat hens' eggs, which they carry about in their bills.
My husband reared these chicks, brought by natives from a nest in a tree
by the river. He did not find it easy, as they were rather old, and would
not open their bills to be fed. They had to be stuffed for several weeks,
doing best on raw fiver, and later on took boiled maize, but never seemed
to do really well until let out to forage for themselves in the open Three
were reared, and two became great friends, dancing (hopping, rather) to each
other, cawing and spreading out their wings, and putting their beaks at
each other in an affectionate sort of way. Unfortunately a Toto, strange to
the place, saw one Crow and, mistaking it for a wild one, threw a stick in the
usual native way and broke its leg. Since then the two remaining Crows
have kept together, but obviously do not enjoy each other's company, and
sometimes the larger of the two will try to drive the other off.
Tropical Crows are not common round here, they seem to like the hot,
low-lying districts better, and at Kisi, near Lake Victoria, I have seen about
fifty of them looking over the native market when business was over.

A TAME TAWNY OWL
I am sending you what I think you will consider a most interesting and
unusual episode in the life of a Tawny Owl who went by the name of " Olive ".
The following notes are contributed by Mr. Lionel Vulliamy, of Cauldwell
Hall, Ipswich, in whose grounds " Olive " was found.
I had the pleasure of looking after her for a fortnight whilst her owner
was away from home, and during that time I found her an extremely
interesting and intelligent bird--quite different from what I expected an Owl
to be. Every morning she would greet my mother and myself with a contented
little " wheeze ". And I am quite sure she knew her name, as she would
always acknowledge it every time it was mentioned.
She was quite docile in the cage and would gently nibble my fingers, at
the same time closing her large dark brown eyes and showing their light-
coloured lids. She was always willing to get on to my hand or wrist, and
it was then that one realized the immense power of her legs and feet, and
one had to be a little careful in disengaging her.
Here is Mr. Villiamy's account:--
" Coming home one evening early in June, we found a baby Tawny Owl--
just a ball of fluff--sitting bolt upright on the ground near an ancient oak
tree. We could see, some 60 feet up, the hole where its nest was and out
of which it had fallen.
" The baby Owl, lit up by the setting sun, looked steadily at us. It made
no movement and did not even wink an eye. The flies were settling round
its eyes. It seemed too weak, or proud, even to try to shake them off. It
just stared steadily at us out of its great round eyes. When we picked it
up it was quite passive, and was evidently upon the point of collapse. We
gave it brandy and milk, and it soon began to revive. From the first it
showed no fear of us, and took food readily from our hands. Soon both
its feathers and its appetite began to grow. Mice, rats, Sparrows, rabbits,
--it ate them all with zest. It was rather a dreadful sight to see it seize the
body of a dead Sparrow. With one tug of its beak the head would be severed,
and at once swallowed whole. Often the Owl--whom we named Olive--
would then try to swallow the whole of the rest of the body--wings, feathers,
legs and all--in one gulp.
" Olive, in her earlier days, was kept in a Parrot's cage, and at night was
brought into the drawing-room. Here she would roam about enjoying her
freedom. Soon she began to make short flights. We then put her into a
large covered-in enclosure, where she seemed quite happy, and would always
fly to a perch and take her food from our hands. She seemed to like being
stroked, making a contented twittering sound, and with her powerful beak,
with which she could almost have removed a finger, she would gently nibble
at one's fingers.
" Towards the end of August we felt that the time had come to give her
her freedom, so that she could learn to find food before the cold weather
came. She has now been free over a month. Every night, as it gets dusk,
my daughter, and I go out into the garden. I whistle, and almost at once
Olive's answering call is heard, sometimes so far off that her call can only
faintly be heard ; sometimes she is quite near, and evidently waiting for us.
Gradually her call--too-whu--comes nearer, and soon, across the darkening
sky, she is seen in rapid flight, a splendid sight, with her fine span of wings.
She generally alights on the ground near to us, and then flies either on to

my head or shoulders. Sometimes she will come down from the sky with a
great swoop and alight on my outstretched arm so lightly and gently that I
hardly realize she is there. Then we feed her, generally with large chunks
of liver, which she loves greatly. Each time she leans forward to take a piece
from my daughter's hand I can feel her powerful claws contract and pierce
through my coat sleeve in her effort to get a firm grip.
" The other day she evidently intended to alight on my head, but, for
some reason, made a bad landing, and alighted on my nose. This gave her
an inadequate foothold, and one painful to me, as she dug her sharp claws in.
She scrambled up my cheek and forehead into a more secure position, leaving
a trail of blood on my face where her claws had penetrated the skin. But
it was all done in love. She always knows when she has had enough, and
can never be coaxed into having another mouthful, but for some time will
continue to sit on my shoulder or arm, looking round and making contented
little noises before flying off. She seems to have no fear of us, but, if a stranger
is with us, she will not come near however hungry she is.
"We are wondering how long she will continue her nightly visits. I suppose
that before long she will grow wilder and cease to be friends with us, but in
the meantime it is pleasant to have this large predatory bird on such very
friendly terms with us."
Hamilton Scott.

By A. Sherriff, F.Z.S.
The birds portrayed in the accompanying drawing are inhabitants
of Nepal, Sikhim, and Bhutan. There is nothing particularly striking
about their colouring but their continuous activity and sharp move-
ments make them most attractive as aviary birds. Like the Black-
headed Sibia they are never still. They have no song, but a low " tsee
tsee 55 is frequently uttered and the note of alarm is somewhat similar
to the trumpet of the Zebra Finch in a lower tone, continually repeated.
Like the Sibia they have the habit of sitting next to one another with
their tails crossed.
Heat is, of course, necessary during the winter but for the size
of the bird they are extraordinarily hardy. In captivity they do well
on ordinary insect food, grapes, honey and milk and they are particularly
fond of the last. If meal-worms are cut up they will in time eat them but
too many are bad.
They are best kept in an aviary with an outdoor flight because in
cages they fight, and it is amazing the injuries they inflict on one another
and equally extraordinary how quickly they recover.
There is no outward sex difference and no record of them having
been bred. It is unfortunate that they are not more often imported for
they are most attractive aviary birds.

AN AMATEUR'S EXPERIENCE IN IMPORTING
HUMMING BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975647575757576" page_id="56219640"  page_num="122" year="" vol="">
By Mrs. Wharton-Tigar
In September last year I accompanied my husband on a short
visit to Pernambuco, Brazil. This place is practically unexplored
from an avicultural point of view, so I determined to try and bring
home a collection of rare birds. With this end in view, I made
a hurried study of the birds to be found in that part of Brazil,
and in this I was greatly helped by an article by a Mr. Forbes,
written in The Ibis in 1881 , on the birds he saw in Pernambuco
when on a visit there.
Late in July I had met Mr. Seth-Smith and he had accepted my
offer to obtain and bring over twenty Humming Birds for the Zoo.
As I was returning in November and my stay in Pernambuco would
only last three weeks, I rather wondered if I had been rash in
making this offer !
We chose the Royal Holland Lloyd line to travel on, as it was
the only line we could find that would let us bring back birds and
would undertake to keep them warm. We sailed from Southampton
on the S.S. Zeelandia on 28 th September, and early dawn of 12 th
October saw us nearing Pernambuco. As we slowed down to await
the pilot boat the air was delicious, clear and not too warm; the
port showing itself in a very long line of twinkling lights. After
some hours we slowly got alongside the quay, and as we got in we
could see natives--niggers and mulattos--with pineapples, highly
painted gourds, and many large cages of birds, squirrel monkeys,
marmosets, and other small mammals, which they try to sell to the
passengers, mostly, of course, on the home-coming boats. I noticed
that the birds offered were not in good condition, usually sticky,
the Manakins and Hummers especially.
The State is generally known by the name of Pernambuco, but
the town there is really called 11 Recife It is divided into three
parts by the River Capiberibe, which winds in and out, separating
the portions known as Recife, Santo Antonio, and Boa Vista.
Bridges across give the place a gay appearance and in various parts

An Amateur's Experience in Importing Humming Birds 123
of the town there are small public gardens which I thought were
quite cleverly laid out. They are planted with beautiful trees of
different sorts, some of the acacia family, others resembling huge
laburnums; big bushes of oleanders (poisonous to birds, by the way)
and bougainvillia (really a creeper) throw rods 15 to 20 feet long,
covered with the gayest flowers in bright crimson, purple, and even
orange. There are hibiscus, with large single flowers in shades of
pink, red, and yellow, and tropical lilies with scented white and rose
flow T ers--these appeared to be crinums--and palms, often in wonder-
ful variety, tower up into the sky. Some of these must be quite a
hundred years old. The trees are mostly tall and branching,
bearing such fruits as the mango, the Jack fruit, the jaboticaba,
the caju, the mangaba, the araca, the goiaba, the sapoti, and the
abacate. All these, when in flower, are a great attraction to the
birds, especially the Sugar Birds, Quits, and Hummers, and when
in fruit Tanagers and Thrushes abound.
The morning air is most exhilarating out there, and the people
of the country are very early risers; from 5 to 7 a.m. is by far
the nicest part of the day, the temperature then being about
75 degrees. In the middle of the day, in the houses, it rises to from
80 to 85, but the welcome sea breeze prevents the heat from becoming
oppressive. The houses are built to withstand the great heat, with
verandahs and plenty of windows which are always open. We
were there in the very dry season and the heat was terrific, but
I was surprised to find that I could get about with less discomfort
than over here during a hot spell.
When I arrived at the "pension", which we had chosen especially
because it had a large garden, I found that our room was
immediately opposite a very large tree (a " jambo ", with pinkish
fruits looking like small pink wax pears and tasting like cotton
wool dipped in sugar and water !). This was not then in fruit, but
was covered with masses of creamy white blossoms from about 15
feet up to a great height and circumference. As I looked up I saw
hundreds of Banana Quits, several varieties, some very tiny, others
a little bigger, some very bright yellow, others duller. I also
noticed several Yellow Tanagers ( Calliste flava), this being a very

common bird in Pernambuco; and, besides seeing a number in this
tree, I often heard their sweet little song when sitting in the garden
under the sapoti trees. These latter were just ripening, their
queer fruits rather like a bad pear !
The tree opposite my window was a great source of pleasure to
me; at five next morning I awoke and looked out, and had a
splendid view. Birds were constantly backwards and forwards--all
sorts of Quits and many varieties of the Blue Tanagers, some a
glorious powder blue, some grey, and some nearly green. I took
these to be Tanagra cana , T. episcopus, and T . sayaca. I never
managed to buy any of the Tanagra cana or of the glorious bright
blue ones that might have been something even better. I saw a lot
of lovely little yellow birds with orange red heads, which I know
now were Nemosia sordida. I also frequently saw a beautiful
Thrush with crimson sides, all sorts of Doves, and many other birds
which were too far off to be distinguished.
I lost no time in going to the market at St. Jose. This is a
very disappointing place for birds, but surprises do occur. The
bird portion is small and close to the sugar-cane section, where
there are stacks of long canes, and natives about, chewing
monotonously all the time. The birds are all together, usually in
very large cages. Among others were Pope Cardinals in rough
condition, Saffron Finches, the several grey Sporophila that they
call " Patativas " and which are bought by Brazilians as song birds.
Often there are big cages of Cassiques; I saw some very bright
yellow ones but did not buy any as they are not popular in
England. There were plenty of Brazilian Hangnests, which if
caught wild are quite cheap, but if pale coloured are hand-reared
and command a high price.
Soon after I landed and made inquiries about bird collecting
I was told of a Swiss who was very keen on birds, and who, they
told me, had reared Hummers from the nest. I lost no time in
finding out where he lived. His name is Mr. Cordier and he lives
with his charming Brazilian wife in a bungalow where he has quite
large aviaries, well equipped and thought out. I arrived there on
a Sunday afternoon and he took me round his aviaries at once.

An Amateur&amp;apos;s Experience in Importing Humming Birds 125
They certainly were a fine sight and I never had a greater thrill.
He must have had at least a hundred Hummers, all in glorious
condition : the Bizorro as they call it (probably the Pigmy Wood
Hermit, a tiny brown thing no larger than a bumble bee), some of
the larger Wood Hermits, and Jacobins with glistening white tails
and wings, all of which had been in his aviaries for months.
He showed me with pride a tiny Horned Hummer which nothing
apparently would induce him to part with. He found a mate for
it, however, and I persuaded him to let me have the pair; but,
alas! they both died on almost the first night on the journey home,
after the rough usage they had had on the quay and on the ship
before I could get things straightened out. Besides the Hummers
there w r as a glorious collection of Manakins --Manacus manacus,
Pipra rufocapilla, rare Tanagers, Cayenne Crakes, Water Tyrants,
and even a Swallow.
I was soon told that I could have none of these treasures as they
were all booked to go to Germany via Havre in a few days. I believe
some of the Hummers were bought by Mr. Ezra for the Zoo.
Naturally, I felt crestfallen, but Mr. Cordier told me that more
could be found and collected for me. I told him what I wanted and
he said he would find all he could, and he did. It was a great
disadvantage of course to have to bring over newly caught birds, and
under a week before I sailed for home most of my Manakins,
Nemosia pileata, and several others were still being hancl-fed. What
an education it was to watch Mr. Cordier do this. If the newly
caught birds do not start to feed very quickly he liberates them and
they fly straight back to the forests.
Besides Mr. Cordier I went to a certain Joao da Matta, a smart
native who had been trained by Mr. Cordier, and from him I got
Sporophila hypoleuca , the five Hummers of a new species ( Helio-
master squamosa), and several of the rarer birds I brought over.
Around Pernambuco, in the surrounding towns, there are held
on Sundays various fairs. I managed to attend two of these and
on each occasion I was fortunate in finding something rare. I was
in Brazil for three Sundays and would have managed to attend
several more fairs--*&amp;apos; # feiras " they are called over there---but could

Mrs. Wharton-Tigar --
not, as my husband took a marked objection to standing about in
the blazing sun while I bargained with the natives! So I had to
give up the idea and we went to Boa Viagem instead, where surely
there is the most perfect sea bathing in the world.
Mr. Cordier undertook to cage and pack all my birds, besides
getting me through the Brazilian Customs (no easy matter !), and
to buy me all the necessary foods for the journey home. I had
taken out well-made cages for the birds to be brought home in, but
on arrival I found that I could not bring these in without paying an
exorbitant duty, so they remained in bond until I left--I never
opened them again until I arrived back in London. They would also
not allow me to land my supply of dried flies and ants' eggs, and
would have destroyed them if influence had not been brought to
bear ! These were also put in bond and I was alllow&amp;apos;ed to reclaim them
as I left, and they proved very valuable for feeding the birds on the
way back. They also object to meal-worms, so I left mine on board
in cold storage, and was very glad of them later. I should mention
here that we came home on the same steamer as we went out on,
the boat cruising down to Buenos Aires and back during our stay
in Pernambuco.
Another good way of picking up birds is to meet the Lloyd
Braziliero boats from Para and Manaos. I went on board several,
and on one occasion I bought a pair of Stilts from one of the
sailors. The poor birds were in a very bad condition, all crowded
together in a tiny basket. I also saw&amp;apos; two fine Hyacinth Macaw&amp;apos;s,
but could not buy of course. I saw Sun Bitterns and Trumpeters,
but I know very little about this type of bird so I did not buy any.
I just missed a very rare little monkey and fell in love with
" Chico ", a little Capuchin monkey now at the Zoo. How t fond he
was of me! I well remember his joy on my appearance at the door
of the bird cabin. Not having seen him for several months, I am
wondering w&amp;apos;hat my reception will be like when w r e meet again.
I shall never forget the clay w&amp;apos;e left Pernambuco. After waiting
on the quay with the birds in crates from 10 o'clock in the morning
until seven in the evening, w r e w&amp;apos;ere absolutely exhausted. All the
large, roughly made crates w r ere dumped on board, and I w&amp;apos;as left to

try and make Dutch stewards understand what I wanted done with
them. None of the bigger cages would fit in a cabin, so, to make
matters worse, I had to take all the wicker cages out of the Hummer
crates and carry them one by one to the cabin. The smaller cases
with wire fronts were all placed in a position so that the birds got
no light or air. Blank despair can only describe my feelings; add
to this acute seasickness and you will see how black things seemed.
The ship had allotted to me a third-class cabin in the worst part of
the ship for my birds, but luckily other passengers complained and
I was moved to two outside cabins in a more secluded and unused
part of the ship. The heat was so great that within a minute of
entering the cabin everything I wore was as wet as if I had got into
a bath.
I arranged the birds as best I could and went from them to my
bed for several days, wondering if I could manage to hold out, and
to add to my troubles the glass Hummer bottles kept on breaking
at such a rate that I thought I should never manage to keep any
Hummers alive. I can only put this down to the terrible heat as,
I am glad to say, none cracked after Madeira, so the situation was
saved.
I was greatly assisted on board by a charming Dutch lady,
Mrs. Van Eeghen, who offered to help and joined me at 6.30 a.m.
and 4.30 p.m., when we fed the birds. At midday I also changed
the Hummers' food. It used to take us two hours to do all the
feeding, twice a day, working hard. I followed out Mr. Cordier's
instructions about feeding to the letter, and they were pretty
strenuous.
On the whole the losses I suffered were moderate considering the
terrible and very sudden changes in temperature. After Vigo it
became very cold, and owing to the determination of my kind
friend, Mrs. Van Eeghen, the place was kept warm enough. She
was a great help in managing the Dutch Engineer and the Purser,
and also in organizing the preparation for landing the birds at
Southampton and tackling the stewards in their own language. We
packed everything as warmly as we could, stuck paper over cracks

the tender and a long train journey before depositing the birds
safely in London. No losses occurred, however, and the Hummers
were hurried to the Zoo, the other birds to my home in
Hampstead.
It may be of interest if I give below a list of some of the birds
which I finally managed to land in England :--
The following are first importations alive, so far as is known :

This was certainly one of the strangest birds which we came
across during our sojourn on the Little Barrier, one of its few
nesting grounds.
Our first aquaintance with it was on our way over to the
island from the mainland when small flocks were seen on the
water. The first night, however, as soon as it got dark, we were
startled by the loud cries which seemed to fill the air on every

hand. They were something like the call of a Guinea-fowl but
much louder and interspersed with numerous other strange cries.
At first we were baffled as to the origin of these calls, but as our
eyes became accustomed to the darkness, we were able to make out
the dusky forms of hundreds of the Petrels, always in couples
chasing each other at an incredible speed. All night long this
continued, and every night afterwards until the early hours
of the morning.
The Petrels nest in deep burrows in the densest virgin forest
above a thousand feet on the mountains of the Little Barrier.
A party of young scientists who were on the island at the same
&amp;quot;time told us that when they climbed up on to the higher ranges
amongst the nests, and camped there the night, the birds kept
coming and going the whole time, running in large numbers over
the sleeping bags. But always in the morning there were numbers
lying about dead, some with their heads chewed off. They thought
that the birds must have crashed against the branches or trunks
of the trees in the dark and were subsequently mauled by either
the large Tuatara lizards or the wild cats.
When on the higher ridges of the mountains, we found innumer-
able dead Petrels on the track, many of them quite out of the
nesting area. It is a very strange thing that large numbers of
the Cook's Petrel are always found dead during the nesting
season on the Little Barrier. Other Petrels nest there but no
dead ones are ever found. I have been on other islands where
various other species nest, but this never happens anywhere else.
The only solution to the problem is that the birds appear to fight,
and chase each other in mid-air, and certain ones get killed and
fall into the forest, or, on the other hand, they may kill them-
selves by striking the trees as they descend into the forest.
High on the ridges in the densest forest, at a height of about
two thousand feet, w r e found innumerable burrow&amp;apos;s of this Petrel,
mostly with a single young one in. This we ascertained by putting
a long stick dowm the hole which caused the young one to make
a low grunting noise. We could never reach the birds as the
burrow&amp;apos;s Avere too long and the ground too matted with roots

to dig down. The same burrows appear to be used year after
year, as we found no freshly excavated ones, all the earth round
the holes being covered with a growth of lichen and moss.
Considering the weak feet and beak of the bird it is a marvel
how the birds manage to tunnel to such a depth. It is also wonderful
how these swift, long-winged birds can fly with impunity in the
thick forest, especially at night when the darkness is intense. We
found an adult bird in the breeding grounds; it was sitting under
a log and appeared to be unable to fly. It had possibly been
stunned and was unable to find its way to the edge of the cliff.
The birds, as they come in from the sea when the night has set in,
simply fall down through the dense forest vegetation to their nesting
holes, but being unable to rise from the dense vegetation have to
make their way to the edge of the cliff, often a great distance,
and from there throw themselves over into the air. As w r ith most
other Petrels, the legs are weak, the bird being unable to stand
upright so that it can only shuffle along with the aid of its
wings. Cook's Petrel feeds mainly on minute marine life
commonly known under the name of " Plankton ".
Petrels are truly birds of mystery. The more one studies them,
the more mysterious and fascinating they become. A whole life-
time would be all too short to study their strange and diverse
ways.
The North Island Kiwi ( Apteryx mantelli)
The Kiwi is so intimately associated with New Zealand, it
was one of my great ambitions wdien I reached the hospitable
shores of that country to see something of the life of these strange
birds. The more I pursued my objective, the more remote did my
chances of its realization become. After several weeks spent in
various parts of the North Island where the only large areas of
native forest were left, I began to realize how very rare these
birds had become. And it is little wonder, for no New Zealand
bird has to combat so many enemies and probably no bird is so
inadequately equipped for doing so. The Kiwi is one of the most
defenceless of all living birds, for in the distant ages this bird

had no need of self-protection for it had no enemies. Dogs, human
beings, and forest fires were, after the first settlement of New
Zealand, the worst foes of the Kiwi. On the edge of the forest,
reserves the farmers allow their cattle, in the winter time, to
penetrate far into the forest so that they may feed on the under-
growth, and dogs are frequently used to round them up. The
Kiwis having a strong scent are soon found out by the dogs, who
in 99 cases out of a 100 kill the birds before they can be stopped.
The burning of the bush is again fatal to these birds, for when
asleep in hollow logs or in holes under the roots of the forest
trees, they stand no earthly chance when the fire sweeps along. In
the early days countless thousands must have been sacrificed in
this way, a fitting offering to the god Mammon! And in the
remote parts where the destruction of the forest goes on many
still perish.
In the Government reserves a new and very formidable enemy
is the opossum trapper, who penetrates to the farthest recesses of
the virgin forest in his quest. These marsupials, I might mention,
were introduced many years ago from Australia, in the mad days
when every pest under the sun was introduced into New&amp;apos; Zealand,
and have since increased and spread themselves all over the
country w&amp;apos;ith great rapidity. Though these animals in themselves
are quite harmless to the native flora and fauna, their pursuers
are not. A fev r years ago the skins of these mammals became
fashionable in Europe and so great w r as the demand that #1 or
more was paid for good skins. A skilful trapper could get 400 in a
season, so no wonder the forests were overrun by men, for the
main part unemployed, or others desirous of adding to a meagre
income.
The usual method employed in catching these inoffensive
animals is to find a track, usually at the bottom of a tree, and there
set a large steel-toothed trap. In a great many cases the tracks
are not those of the opossums but of the Kiwis, v&amp;apos;ho are very
local and never wander a great distance from their hiding places,
and who make well-worn pathways from their holes to the hunting
grounds. The Kiv&amp;apos;i sauntering along, probing the ground with

his long sensitive beak, invariably gets caught, the cruel jaws
smashing his bill in half. If it were not that organ, it was one of
his legs. The trapper, frightened to do anything with the bird
owing to the strict protective laws, either kills it outright and
throws the body away or lets it go to die a lingering death in the
forest.
In an extensive valley, one of the last large strongholds of the
Kiwi on the mainland, I w T as told that over a hundred birds met
their doom in one single season. Fortunately for both the Kiwis and
the opossums the price of the skins of the latter are down to 4s. Sd.
or less, and owing to their numbers being so reduced, they are
not hunted nearly as much as formerly, but not before the ranks
of the Kiwis have been sadly thinned out as well.
When up near the North Cape of New Zealand I found that
numbers of Kiwis are being deliberately killed by both the Maoris
and the white settlers, by the latter for eating and by the former
to sell to their fellow-countrymen for the making of the feathered
cloaks, either to sell to tourists or to use for special occasions.
Then there are, of course, other enemies in the shape of cats,
rats, weasels, and stoats, who prey on the eggs or the young
birds, and so it is a logical conclusion that in a generation or two
Kiwis will have ceased to exist on the mainland of New Zealand.
But as long as the island sanctuaries are preserved as such, the
Kiwi will not pass away altogether.
As most readers know the Kiwis are probably the most unique
of all living birds. The size of a large fowl, they are clothed with
brown hair-like feathers, and although they are usually called
wingless they possess very rudimentary wings which have no
feathers on them. They have no tail. The beak is very long and
supposed to be slightly flexible; the nostrils are situated at the
tip of the upper mandible which overlaps the lower one. The
colour of the beak is a fleshy horn colour and has the appearance
of being highly polished. After death the colour fades and the
gloss vanishes. From the base of the beak spring long hairs, which
no doubt in some way act as feelers. The birds possess very thick
and heavy legs, the toes being armed with extremely stout and

sharp nails, a single kick of which can rip open a man's hand or
foot.
The Kiwis are strictly nocturnal, only coming out after dark
and spending the night in probing in the soft earth for worms and
insects upon which they feed. They move noisily through the
vegetation and their continual sniffing can be distinctly heard.
Before day-break the birds retire to their comfortable burrows,
either in a hollow log of some large tree lying prone upon the
ground or else to a cavity in the roots of some giant forest tree.
My first acquaintance with the Kiwis was on the Little Barrier
Island where they were almost tame. Some of them had been
released there many years ago and they do not seem to have moved
very far from the spot where they were originally liberated. From
what we saw of them the birds seemed to prefer the open grass flats
near the shore to the higher forests which, according to most books,
is the natural habitat of the Kiwi. An hour or so after darkness
had fallen these strange, unbirdlike creatures could be seen ambling
along through the grass. One had only to stand still for a few
minutes to be aware of their noisy progress through the herbage.
When overtaken the birds would break into a peculiar ambling
run, swaying from side to side.
On the flats it was very easy to catch them, but not so on the edge
of the forest, for the bird, after running a few yards, would hide
in a clump of ferns or forest debris, or I have seen them press
up against the roots or the trunk of a tree and try to escape
observation in that way. In our hunting for the birds we used a
powerful electric torch which strangely enough did not seem to
dazzle or inconvenience them in any way.
Kiwis make a nest either under a pile of brushwood in a hollow
log or in a clump of tangled grass and fern or in a cavity at the
base of a hollow tree. One or two enormous eggs are laid, each
often weighing a quarter the total weight of the bird. How it
manages to lay such colossal eggs is a mystery. These are incubated
by the cock bird who, not being able to cover them, lies across
them.
Kiwis must be long-lived birds, for a large albino example

released on the island in 1913 was still there at the time of our
visit. This bird seemed to haunt the environs of the caretaker's
house.
We had no difficulty in catching the birds at night when they
were in the long grass on the strip of land between the forest
and the sea. They seem to be unable to move with the rapidity with
which they do in the forest. The birds made no defence save an
occasional snapping with the beak, though had we not held them
by the legs we should have undoubtably been badly scratched. We
found the birds in most cases troubled by ticks which w r e found
adhering to the head and ears. These have most probably been
brought over with the cattle. Unfortunately the feathers are very
lightly held in the flesh and they come out in large quantities when
the birds are handled.
Late one evening we caught a fine adult male (the male is
much smaller than his mate) intending to keep him over night in
a box which we had prepared and take his photograph in the
morning. He proved quite tractable until the morning but try
as we would we found it utterly impossible to take his photograph.
He refused to stand, even in the bright sunlight, the moment
he w r as released he would take a header for the forest. At length
we gave it up and restored him to a vacant Kiwi burrow T , to brood,
no doubt, over his strange experiences.
There is a belief amongst the colonists that Kiwis are dirty
birds and are infested w T ith lice. This was, as far as we found,
quite erroneous. All the birds we handled were in beautiful
condition and perfectly free from all parasites except the few cattle
ticks about the ears which doubtless the birds could not remove.
We kept several birds over night. These remained quietly
in their box and made no effort to escape, making no sound
whatever except an occasional squeak and a sniffing noise as they
no doubt searched for the food which we placed in the box.
Usually Kiwis are very noisy birds, and we often heard them
screaming around our tent at night. Their usual cry is an
awful scream, rather terrifying wffien heard at close quarters in
the middle of the night.

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds 135
We could never understand why the birds came down on to
the flat grassland where the soil was hard and dry and it would
be impossible to probe into the ground with the bill. Possibly the-
birds came down for the grasshoppers which abounded there.
The birds were certainly more plentiful there than in the forest.
The following is a short extract from a friend who was on the-
island after we le#t: " We camped a night near the mouth of
the Valley of the Styx and, both there and subsequently on the
ranges of the east coast, we heard the numerous Kiwis before the
Petrels started in. With regard to A. mantelli, on L.B., I would
draw your attention to an article by Captain Hutton in Vol. I,
page 106, Trans. N.Z. Inst., in which he states, It will be
noticed that the Kiwi (A. mantelli) does not appear in the list, and
notwithstanding current reports I am inclined to think that it is.
either very rare or else does not exist on the island.' However,
I wanted to correct the false impression I had given that the
Kiwis were confined to the Flat and its environs."
Of the other three species of Kiwis found in New Zealand I
saw nothing. They are extremely rare and only found in isolated
parts. The largest species of all I should doubtless have seen
had I been able to reach my destination on Stewart Island, but
I was driven back by tempestuous seas.
In the old days, 1850 to 1900, Kiwis were, at infrequent,
intervals, imported into Europe and proved to be long-lived in
captivity, their food being cut-up raw meat and earth-worms,
but they proved uninteresting captives as they only came out at
night and during the day remained hidden in the hay or straw.
There is now no hope that we shall ever see these interesting
birds in Europe, for the Government will not even allow permits
for specimens to be kept in the New Zealand " Zoos ". I saw
one of the Ministers who had to deal with the question and I
broached the subject of permits being granted for specimens to
be exported to various Zoological Gardens in Europe, but he was
very definite in his reply and stated that under no circumstances
would birds be allowed to be exported, or even to be kept in their
own country.

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
Perhaps it is for the best that the restrictions are on the hard
side, for it shows that at least there is some interest in the
preservation of the native fauna, but in spite of every effort on
the part of the Government I am afraid that the Kiwi will
disappear ere long from the mainland of New Zealand. Perhaps
in future days, when sea travel is cheaper, ornithologists will be
able to visit that island paradise and see far themselves these
strange birds in their natural setting and bless those far-sighted
people who set aside this beautiful island for the preservation of
their wonderful avifauna.
The Shining Cuckoo (Lamprococcyx lucidus)
Of all the smaller New Zealand birds this is perhaps the most
beautiful. It strongly reminds one of the wonderful Shining
Cuckoos of Africa. It was two months after landing in New
Zealand that I first saw one of these illusive creatures; previously
I had heard the strange and very distinctive whistle which caused
the Maoris to call them " pipiwarauroa ", which word they say
resembles their call, but I am afraid that this needs a very great
stretch of imagination.
It was only upon coming to the Little Barrier that I made
an intimate acquaintance with it. The first pair observed were in
the garden of the caretaker's house, where I found them busily
clearing the fruit trees of caterpillars upon which these birds
mainly feed. Like all the other birds of this island they were
comparatively tame and allowed one to approach them within a few
feet and watch them at their work.
Up to this last few years the winter quarters of this bird were
unknown. It was surmised that they wintered in the islands in
the Eastern Pacific. But recently they have been found in the
Solomon Group. They leave New Zealand in the early autumn
(January or February) returning in the summer at the end of
September or the beginning of November. Its habitat is rather the
outskirts of the forest than in the interior. It frequents orchards
and gardens, proving a great blessing to fruit growers by
clearing the fruit trees of insect pests, especially the caterpillars

and plum slugs, etc. The Shining Cuckoo is a peaceful and
gentle little creature, seldom forcing itself upon one's notice like
the rest of New Zealand's forest birds. In spite of its beautiful
plumage it is not easily detected when in the trees, the shining
green and striped breast assimilating it into its surrounding.
When the birds arrive at the end of September at the North
Cape they quickly spread themselves over the whole of the country,
being found quite commonly in the far south and in Stewart
Island. This Cuckoo is parasitic and usually places its egg in
the nest of the tiny Grey Warbler. It has always seemed a strange
anomaly that while birds will refuse to rear the young of other
species they will always bring up a Cuckoo ; not only that, but
very often any small " soft-billed " bird will, upon seeing a
young Cuckoo pop some succulent morsel into its mouth. This
I frequently noticed with the Cuckoo in question. In fact I even
saw a Sparrow drop insects into the mouth of a young Shining
Cuckoo. Evidently there is some instinct which forces other small
birds to take upon themselves this strange foster-parenthood and
about which we understand very little.
One of these beautiful birds was found by some friends and
reared for me to take home. It was found as a small nestling and
was kept until about two months old. It was a delightful little
bird and I very much regretted its loss, which I fear was from
feeding it on meal-worms. I am quite convinced that these are
too stimulating and indigestible for most small birds. I have
also found that they often cause a kind of wasting disease which
the pathologists cannot diagnose. Another specimen was reared by
some more friends. It was found, I believe, in a washhouse on the
outskirt of one of the cities. First of all it refused to feed so we
had to cram it by means of a " Filup " feeder. In a short time it
began to pick up hairy caterpillars upon which it was mainly
reared, but when these became scarce it began to feed upon an
insectivorous food mixed with hard-boiled chopped egg and
Madeira cake. I really did not expect that it would ever be
reared, for it was in such a poor and emaciated condition at
first. It picked up quickly when the caterpillars were available,

but I had little hopes of ever bringing it home. Yet though it
drooped at first it withstood the hardships of the long homeward
voyage of nearly seven weeks and is now one of my most treasured
feathered gems.
The Shining Cuckoo is about the size of a Sparrow, a shining
metallic bronze green above, white below heavily barred with
metallic bronze; the feet, which are black, are exceedingly small
and delicate.
The Little Blue Penguin (Eudyptula minor )
This delightful miniature Penguin is abundant all around the
coast of the North Island. It is to be seen in the Auckland Harbour
swimming about amongst the sailing craft, only the head visible
out of the water. It looks at first sight like some tiny seal. When
on shore it makes its home in a hollow log, a cleft in the rocks, or
in one of the thick tussocks of coarse grass. It is only when
moulting or breeding that it 'Stays for any length of time on the
land. It is then very extraordinary how far it will make its way
inland, often half a mile or so, usually up steep cliffs or over rocky
ground. On the Little Barrier we found them often right up in the
forest. Usually they only go far inland for the moulting and not
for breeding, which is carried out quite near the beach, more often
than not in a hollow log, two large, chalky white eggs being laid.
During the period of moulting the birds undergo a fast of from
two to three weeks, but prior to this they get very fat. The old
feathers do not drop out like those of an ordinary bird, but are
pushed out by the new growth, and these still adhere until the new
feather is almost full grown. Sometimes the birds find shelter in a
disused shed or outhouse and occasionally under a box. While
undergoing this unpleasant process the birds look very disreputable
objects, but as soon as this is completed they emerge resplendent in a
garb of the most beautiful shining grey blue and silvery white. The
texture of the feathers is singularly soft and silky and pleasant to
the touch. The pale coloured iris and pupil give them a very
peculiar look. In spite of their tiny size they are not wanting in
courage, and if taken out of their hols or burrow will defend them-

selves with the utmost vigour, often inflicting severe wounds on the
hands with their strong beak, all the while threshing one with their
flippers as hard as they can go. Their pluck is amazing, if one
stands between the bird and the sea it is almost impossible to stop
it reaching its native element.
The Little Blue Penguin does not walk in the usual upright and
rather dignified way as most of the larger Penguins do, but shuffles
along with a stooping gait, and if hard pressed it will throw itself
down and work its way along with the aid of the flippers. It is then
surprising how quickly it gets along.
Although so specially adapted for its oceanic life it suffers
severely in storms, and after very bad weather many bodies can be
seen on the beaches cast up by the tide. Otherwise this little bird
has but few enemies. This bird makes the most delightful pet
imaginable; a single specimen was being kept for me by a friend,
a charmingly tame little fellow who w r ould come up and talk to one
in his quaint, guttural Penguin language. All preparations were
made for his shipment, including blocks of frozen fish, but alas!
the day before I was due to sail he died. I very much regretted his
decease for I do not suppose that I shall ever have the chance of
another of these charming little birds.
Unlike most other Penguins, this is not a gregarious bird, one
only sees them singly or in pairs in the breeding season.
The Flesh-footed Shearwater (Puffinus carneipes)
The various names under which the different groups of Petrels
are known are, to say the least, rather confusing to the beginner :
they are called alternately Shearwaters, Prions, Mollymawks, etc.,
while their vernacular names are legion.
New Zealand and the surrounding islands are doubtless the
metropolis of this family, no less than thirty-four species being
found around the coasts and islands. Most of the closely allied
species are very difficult to distinguish when on the wing. New
species are being discovered all the time, many only differing in
the length of the primary wing feathers or in the slight variation
of the colouring.

Petrels are a group of highly specialized birds, many with
extraordinary nesting habits. Their powers of flight are amazing,
most species never resting upon land except at the breeding season.
In fact, owing to their weak legs, which are only adapted for
swimming, they cannot walk upright, but simply shuffle along on
their tarsus helped by their wings. Neither can they take off from
flat surfaces owing to the great wing span, but have to mount some
raised object or throw themselves over a cliff to enable them to take
flight. From their method of life, wdiich is purely aquatic, it will
be realized how strange are their nesting habits, for a good number
of this interesting family nest only in the depths of dense forests
on mountain ranges, where they excavate deep burrows in the soil
anything up to 15 feet in length, where they lay their single egg.
One of the chief nesting places of the Petrel in question is a
group of small islands known as the Hen and Chicken Islands off the
coast of New Zealand, which I was fortunate to visit during the
breeding season. The birds burrow r into the loose soil on the forest-
covered slopes of the mountain sides. The burrows instead of going
straight down often turn and twist, which must make it much
harder work for the birds in getting rid of the loose earth. After
a great many preliminaries a single white egg is laid in a chamber
at the end of the burrow. In some burrow&amp;apos;s we found an adult pair
of birds with no egg at all. They fiercely defended themselves
against our intrusion, and they can inflict very severe bites with
their large hooked beaks. Sometimes the burrows are also tenanted
by the unique Tuataras ( Sphenodon punctatum), a strange and
excessively rare reptile, supposed to be the last living link with the
prehistoric reptiles of the far dim, distant ages. These creatures
were once common around the coast of the North Island, but have
long since been exterminated and are now found only on one or two
small islands off the East Coast. We saw quite a few on the Little
Barrier and the Hen and Chickens. Although they look very
formidable they are in reality quite harmless. They have very large
and expressionate brown eyes. They are very strictly protected by
the Government and it is to be hoped that they increase, but it is
hardly likely that they will do to any extent as they are very slow

breeders. Though this is hardly the place to dwell at any length
on these peculiar reptiles I cannot resist from making mention of
what must be one of the rarest forms of animal life now inhabiting
the earth.
To get back to the birds, these do not seem to resent the presence
of these strange creatures and it has been stated that the Tuataras
will attack anyone interfering with the nesting birds. It appeared
to us that reptiles did not actually use the same nesting burrow as
the Shearwaters, but lived in a joint burrow which had the same
entrance. We found several eggs which appeared to have been
sucked, but whether it was done by the Tuataras I could not say.
No doubt if they did this the birds would resent their intrusion,
which they certainly do not appear to do.
Upon one of the islands there had been a copper mine which
had been abandoned for many years, and in the " bush " had been a
shack used by the miners. This had long since disappeared and
only a number of rusted corrugated iron sheets, which had formerly
been the roof, marked its site. Under these iron sheets several
Petrels had found convenient nesting sites. We released a couple
of birds which we found under one of the sheets, in order to see
how they would take off, but in this w T e were disappointed, for the
birds shuffled with the aid of their long wings down the hill-side
until lost to view.
One day a friend and I thought we would spend the night on
the island, so with the aid of a few T blankets from the yacht we made
our beds under clumps of " flax " on the beach. In the evening
just before dark fell the Petrels became very numerous, flying to
and fro from the forest-covered hill-sides. Shortly before midnight
they began to call. Of all the bird sounds I have ever heard these
were the most weird. Perhaps the surroundings accentuated it, but
all night long the ghostly black forms of these large Petrels flitted
across the star-spangled sky; there was not a breath of air or a
movement on the water except the gentle ebb of the tide as it lapped
on the stones only a few* feet away. Before, all was silent, then
they started, first one and then the other until the noise increased
so much in volume that sleep was out of the question. The cry was

exactly like the terrified screaming of a child. In the stillness of
the night with the sinister black forms like winged demons flitting
across the sky, it seemed as though we had chanced upon that inferno
where the Catholics tell us the souls of the unbaptized children go
for eternal torment. The more one listened the more human and
heartrending the cries seemed to become, so that we were not sorry
when the dawn broke and these strange creatures retired to their
burrows or to the distant sea for their fishing.
It will ever remain a mystery how the birds are able to penetrate
through the dense upper tiers of the forest on a pitch-black night
and find their burrows, and are then able to take off again and get
through the branches without injuring themselves. All around the
burrows the ground was bare and perfectly clean; there was none
of the dirt and mess one usually associates with sea birds, and in
the burrows all is scrupulously clean. Like most other Petrels the
young get excessively fat, weighing very much more than the adult
bird. In this stage they look like immense balls of fluff. In time
the young are deserted by the parents while they are still in the
downy stage. Gradually the young lose the down and assume the
adult plumage, becoming, during the course of many weeks of
starvation, much thinner. At last the pangs of hunger drive
them from the burrows, when they make for the sea and, throwing
themselves into the air, they are ready to brave the perils of the
ocean, not returning to land until they are adult and feel the
natural urge of reproduction.
In the olden days many thousands of these birds were collected
from the nesting holes by the Maoris on their " Mutton-birding "
expeditions, but since the islands have become sanctuaries this has
been stopped.
The Saddleback (Greadion carunculatus)
A three hours' journey from the Little Barrier Island by motor
launch lies another smaller and even more precipitous island, which
is also one of the last refuges of an exceedingly rare and aberrant
Starling-like bird, known in the old days to the colonists as the
" Saddleback ", a most conspicuous and striking bird, well known

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds 143
in the forests of both islands in the early days of colonization, but,
like most of New Zealand's endemic birds, its numbers were soon
reduced until it finally became almost extinct on the mainland. It
is now only found on the Hen Island and one or two very small
islets off Stewart Island. Some years ago a few birds were released
on Kapiti Island. These are still there, but they do not seem to have
increased to any extent.
Our first glimpse of this bird was very fleeting. On leaving the
Little Barrier, intending to go to the Poor Rights Islands, we
stopped for a short time at the Hen Island to see if we could see any-
thing of the birds. A short time after we landed and made our way
up the precipitous hill-side, we heard the loud and extraordinary
calls of the birds, and in a few minutes had a view of a very fine
male bird only a few yards away; he soon vanished from our sight.
The Hen Island is much smaller than the Little Barrier, and is far
more precipitous, rising in a short distance from the shore to a
height of 1,300 feet. The whole island is covered from the edge
of the sea to the top of the ridges with the most beautiful virgin
forest, the great pleasure of which is the undergrowth of magnificent
Nikau-palms, a very near affinity to the well-known decorative
palm so much used in Europe.
On our second visit we were fortunate in seeing quite a few of
these very rare birds. In the area of forest where we stopped the
birds seemed fairly numerous, but for the main part they were
extremely wary and difficult to observe, which is very unusual, for
most of the birds in the sanctuaries are very confiding. I believe
this was due to a certain expedition calling and shooting many of
these birds. This expedition finally arrived in Auckland to ask
for permission to collect native birds, which was, quite rightly,
refused, but not before great slaughter had been done to the native
avifauna in the island sanctuaries and in the Chatham Islands
and elsewhere.
We heard the loud and very distinct calls of the birds all the
time we were on the island, and noticed the Saddlebacks feeding
upon the berries of a tall shrub, Nothopanax arboreum. These
berries are relished by most forest birds.

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
Like many of New Zealand's indigenous birds, this species has
no near affinities and stands in a genus on its own. It is slightly
larger in size than a Starling, of a glossy black, with the whole
of the wing coverts, back, and upper and lower tail coverts bright
chestunt. At the base of the stout pointed beak below the eye is a
bright-orange wattle. This species is evidently in an evolutionary
phase in regard to the juvenile plumage, for in some districts
there is a distinct immature stage in which the young are a
uniform cinerious brown, and these do not assume the adult plumage
for a considerable time. On the Hen Island and on Kapiti Island
the young leave the nest in the adult plumage. There are several
species (I believe) which show the same tendency, Pennant's
Parrakeet being one of them. In the early days the immature
Saddlebacks were described as another species and called by Puller
the Jack Bird.
At the beginning of the last century the Saddleback was one
of the most characteristic birds of the New Zealand forest, and
was well known to the Maoris, who wove many legends about it.
Now it is absolutely unknown to the majority of New Zealanders.
It moves through the forests very rapidly, exercising most of the
time its great vocal powers. It mainly inhabits the upper tiers
of the foliage and does not, as far as I noticed, descend to the
ground, though this is no criterion, for my acquaintance with this
interesting bird was all too short. Its food is mainly the large
grubs found in decaying wood, which the bird procures with the
aid of its chisel-like beak. That this species is not difficult to keep
in captivity is proved by the fact that several were kept for many
weeks on the Hen Island prior to their being transferred to Kapiti
Island, where they were released. Otherwise there is no record of
its ever being kept. And now there is not the remotest chance that
it will ever be seen in the aviaries of aviculturists even in New
Zealand, for, like the Stitchbird, it is most rigorously protected,
at least in the North, for in the South on the one or two small
islets oh Stewart Island it is rather at anyone's mercy. But it is
to be hoped that no effort will be spared to save this vanishing relic
of New Zealand's unique avifauna.

New Zealand is noted for the abundance and also for the striking
plumage of its Cormorants, or, as they are locally known, Shags.
No less than sixteen species are found in New r Zealand waters,
some of them being of great beauty, but, alas! many of them are
now, owing to the insane slaughter of all Cormorants, excessively
rare and extremely local, some species being restricted to a single
small island or even one isolated rock.
The Pied Shag (Phalacrocorax varius) is one of the commonest
species, and many have been seen in a good many places around
the coast, especially on the outlying islands which are at all forested,
for this species is arboreal. On the Little Barrier Island the com-
monest of the Shags was found there. Not far from the caretaker's
house is a fairly large nesting site, on a cliff about 150 feet high
and near the top, where the old and gnarled pohutukawa trees
grow out at right angles to the cliff face. The birds built their
large and untidy nests on the most exposed branches which hung
over the waters in positions quite inaccessible to all foes, except
the fool with the shot-gun. At the time of our visit the young had
left the nest and were sitting in rows on the bare branches, looking
very lovely in their spotless black, green, and white plumage. The
old birds were flying backwards and forwards with heavily laden
crops from the sea, intent on feeding the youngsters, but this they
refused to do until we had moved off.
On Stewart Island it was a beautiful sight to see in the trees
by the shores of the placid waters of the many beautiful inlets,
large " shaggeries " inhabited by several species of Shags, the Pied
being predominant. In Stewart Island, twenty odd miles from the
southernmost extremity of the South Island, we have a vision of the
splendour that was once New Zealand's. The avaricious hand of
Man has touched this beautiful island but lightly, and the slight
wounds inflicted have healed. The excessive rainfall has been the
main factor which has saved Stewart Island from the mad
destruction that has gone on on the mainland, for here the forests
are too damp to burn.
Almost the entire surface of this island is very mountainous.

Messrs. Shaw-Mayer and Walter Goodfellow have just returned
from a trip to the new Hebrides, and have brought home a number
of birds new to aviculture. There are a number of examples of the
Royal Parrot-finch (Erythrura regia), a beautiful bird with red
head and mostly blue body; a pair of Palm Lorikeets (Hypo-
charmosyna palmarum ), two species of Zosterops (Z. flavifrons and
Z. griseinota), three yellow-tinted Honey-eaters (Glyciphila incana
flavotincta ), some Cardinal Honey-eaters (Myzomela cardinalis),
and a pair of Kingfishers (Halcyon julise).
A very good coloured plate of the Royal Parrot-finch appeared
in The Ibis for 1881.

I have never found Parrotlets injured by oily seeds. It is Lovebirds,
Brotogerys Parrakeets and Conures that are much better without them.
Parrotlets are usually fond of moistened bread as an " extra " to their diet.
I do not think Mr. Villiamy is likely to find that his Brown Owl grows
wilder when she has been longer at liberty. Owls never seem to forget their
friends and the British species, at any rate, usually recognize them after
long intervals.

It would appear that the climate of Somerset tends to produce avian as
well as human longevity. The April number records the death, at Chard, of a
twenty-year-old Goldfinch. A month ago I found an old lady in my parish
(Taunton) bemoaning the death of a pet Bullfinch which she had kept caged
in her kitchen for nineteen years--and it was not, evidently, a very young
bird when she obtained it. What struck me as even more remarkable was the
fact that, apart from occasional green food, the bird had been fed entirely
on hemp seed, upon which it appeared to thrive until a few weeks before its
death.

Four were packed but two died en route. Eight more were located but the
catcher, a white man, went down with dysentery and fever before these could
be roped in.
Dr. Burgess Barnett in your edition of February last mentions that the
only case of Mamba bite known to him was that of a Mamba which had been
handled for some days prior to its attack. This could not have been a Black
Mamba. No one could handle a healthy Black Mamba without being
immediately attacked.
The two I supplied ran " right true to form " when unpacked. Dr. Burgess
Barnett climbed to the back of the glass cage while I and his lady assistants
rushed out to the public side to watch the proceedings through the glass.
The first " out of the bag " was the small five-foot fellow. He was simply five
feet of quivering, pulsating rage. He opened his mouth like an angry terrier,
he hissed with malice and venomous hatred.
The second " out of the bag " was a larger fellow. He displayed exactly
the same unquenchable animosity to the world at large. Both snakes were
still at the back of the cage. Suddenly the smaller one saw the faces of the
ladies and myself peering through the glass. He was across with lightning
rapidity and literally hurled himself a us. The glass gave him a shock. This-
drew the attention of the bigger fellow to us. He was more cunning. He
came across, then turned as if to move away: after moving a short distance he
rose some three feet, his back towards us, and hurled himself at us backwards,
turning to strike just as he thought he had reached us. He also got a shock.
Nothing living could have dodged those two attacks in the open, unless they
had been specially prepared to meet them, and were on the look-out for them.
Even then they would have had to be terribly quick. Unlike the rest of
African snakes the Black Mamba strikes again and again. He does not retreat.
He fights to the death. He has been torn to pieces by a pack of six large
hounds, probably in less than one minute, but in that minute he struck every
hound and every hound died, one almost as the snake died, the last about one
hour after the fight. This dog was a Great Dane and probably was struck as
the snake was dying and its venom store all but used up. I am proud to have
been the first " fellow " of the Society to provide the Zoo with specimens never
previously exhibited in England.

EGG AND MILK FOR SICK BIRDS
I would like to endorse the remarks of the Marquess of Tavistock in the
February issue of the Magazine regarding the wonderful nourishing properties
of egg and milk for sick and ailing birds, especially Parrots and Parrakeets.
I recently saved the lives of two rare and valuable Parrakeets by administering
to them this food, which consists of one raw egg beaten up with a quarter of a
cup of fresh milk with the addition of a teaspoonful of brandy.
The first bird, a cock Ngau Island Parrakeet was as near death as any bird
I have ever seen: he lay limp with his eyes closed and hardly breathing,
another half-hour would have seen him dead. At first I poured the liquid
down his throat with the aid of a fountain-pen filler and repeated this each
quarter of an hour for the first day; the second day he had so far recovered that
he bit the glass filler in half, swallowing the end he bit off ! This seems to have
caused no ill effect. Later I obtained a small rubber syringe with a bone

nozzle. In a week the bird was able to feed himself on sponge cake soaked in
the egg and milk and now he is in perfect condition.
The other bird was a hen Queen Alexandra Parrakeet which fell ill a week
after I received her from the docks : she, too, was as near death as any bird I
have seen; for a week I forced the liquid down her throat with the aid of the
syringe and at the end of that time she was able to eat seed.
I feel sure that if bird keepers realized the great value of this food they
would use it. It would doubtless save many a sick and ailing bird. The thing
to watch is to try and avoid getting any of the liquid on the bird's plumage.
It is best to wrap the bird in a clean table napkin and if any does get on the
feathers to wipe it off with a warm, damp sponge at once.
It is perhaps hardly necessary to add that the birds, especially if they are
Parrots, should be kept at a high temperature ranging from 85* F. to 90* F.

A slight error occurred in my " Breeding Notes " in the March number of
the Magazine.
On p. 79 " Cayenne Rail ( Creciscus cayennensis) " should read " Cayenne
Rail ( Aramides cayennensis) ".
The tiny Cayenne Rail ( Crecicus ) is a much smaller bird than the far
commoner Aramides, which has been bred on various occasions ; the former,
I believe, never so far ; though there should be no difficulty in doing so,
provided a true pair were obtained, as all the Rails are ready breeders if the
aviary conditions are suitable.
I had four Crecicus cayennensis two or three years ago. Two of these I gave
to the late Mr. Edmund Meade-Waldo, who had them in an aviary in which
was the end of a water-pipe in one corner, covered with rather large-mesh
wire-netting. He several times saw one of the little Rails squeeze itself through
and disappear up the pipe carrying bits of grass in its beat, but nothing
further came of it. I also had at that time--in fact, it was in the same con-
signment--a single Crecicus ruber, a much rarer bird. The cocks of many of
the species of Rails will often build play nests, occasionally in the tops of
bushes, in which they will sleep.

By the Hon. Anthony Chaplin, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
" Of all animated beings this is the most elegant in form and the
most brilliant in colour," wrote Button : a daring statement if we
pause to consider Nature's many other works of beauty, for among
the Lepidoptera are there not jewels without rival ? Yet we must
forgive one, who has, like ourselves, fallen under the spell of the
Trochilidse to the extent of being unable to find in our vast vocabulary
terms fit to express their surpassing loveliness. Be that as it may,
these panegyrics are by no means confined to that illustrious Frenchman,
for Wilson, Waterton, Audubon, and Gosse are among others who have
been prompted to give vent to their feelings on this subject. Indeed,
so much has been written about Humming Birds that we need only
recommend the writings of the above and other authors, while we
confine our efforts to recording a few observations on the birds in
captivity.
Humming Birds have much about them that seems hardly in
keeping with very small birds. At times we are forcibly reminded of
much stronger types such as Boilers and even Hornbills. I will give
as an instance the deliberate and slow manner in which even the
tiniest Hummer scratches its neck with its claw ; there is none of
that almost invisibly rapid movement we are so used to in most small
birds generally. Again, a typical Hummer attitude is to sit with the

head drawn well back between the shoulders and with the bill slightly
elevated--a position very characteristic of Hornbills. This comparison
may seem far-fetched to those who do not realize that it is interesting
to the student of habits to find characteristics persisting in related
groups, irrespective of differences in size and gainliness.
The manner of flight in these birds has received its due share of
comment, but we think it necessary to point out that the wings perform
a horizontal semi-circular beat when the bird is hovering, so that the
haze produced by the rapid beating is not visible below the body but
only above. In all attempts made to draw Humming Birds in flight
this fact has been overlooked, and the " hazy semicircle of indistinct-
ness " is made to envelop the entire bird.
Many species have the habit of drawing the bill through the clenched
claw in order, no doubt, to clean it. This habit can be shared by few
groups, and then only by such versatile creatures as Parrots. It is
a most peculiar manoeuvre and one interesting to watch, especially
when the individual grasps its own bill with its own claw and very
very slowly wipes the entire length in as deliberate a manner as you
could wish to see.
Some species, notably Lampornis, Chrysolampis, and Lepidolarynx,
if disturbed when in an otherwise completely torpid condition will
utter a long drawn-out and plaintive call. This is difficult to account
for, as it can hardly be considered conducive to the sleeper's greater
safety, and we would defer from expounding any theory, at any rate
for the present, on this pleasantly surprising trait. It can be stated
that this torpidity is due as much to dietetic as to atmospheric con-
ditions, although it is a subject about which little can with certainty
be said at the moment.
The brilliancy of the Humming Birds' plumage is entirely different
from--although often compared with--that of the Nectariniidse and
Paradisidse. A Humming Bird will glow in partial darkness like a tiny
lamp, while the Sunbirds need a light playing directly on them in order
to be seen at their best. Indeed, the plumage of the former may be
called luminous, while that of the latter is best described as metallic.
As far as it is possible to say, Humming Birds undergo both a partial
moult and a true moult: during the former the wing feathers are

replaced in pairs at a time. When the wings are perfect there is a short
recuperative period, and then follows the more complete moult for the
body and tail feathers. The whole change of dress takes six months
and is virtually two moults running into one another.
In a former article it was pointed out that it was extremely doubtful
whether these birds ever take insects from flowers. We are now more
certain than ever that insects are taken only in the air, and small spiders
from their webs. The birds of the tooth-billed genus Androdon, however,
are probably divergent in their habits.
Finally, for the benefit of those interested in the classification of
this remarkable family, it may be remarked that Chrysolampis
moschitus bears many points of resemblance in its habits to Lampornis
nigricollis. In fact, we think it would be pardonable to place
Chrysolampis in the genus Lampornis. This view is in some measure
substantiated by the fact that Simon considers the peculiar bird known
as Chrysolampis chlorolcemus (Elliot) to be a hybrid between Chryso-
lampis moschitus and Lampornis nigricollis.

By the Rev. Kingsford Venner
It is now eleven years since I contributed to the Magazine, and
my apology for doing so now regarding a large and varied collection
of mainly common, but beautiful, birds is that many of us in
these days can only afford such. At the head of my collection I
will mention my lovely Leadbeater's Cockatoo, " Dawn ", absolutely
tame and affectionate. Curiously enough, I had both her and the
next inmate, whom I shall mention shortly, just about the time I
last wrote to you eleven years ago. " Dawn " is unusually vivid
in colouring, in fact she makes every other Leadbeater's I ever saw
look rather washed out, her breast being nearly the colour of a
boiled shrimp, not in the least rose " pink, as the birds are
absurdly described in nearly every bird book, unless you add salmon
rose, which nobody does. 11 Dawn " does not talk, except in her
own language, which consists of sundry murmurings and an
occasional burst of screeching (chiefly when some other bird escapes

from its cage and flies round the room). She used to lay two eggs
yearly, and brooded them closely, being then very uncertain in
temper, but this ceased about five years ago. She distinctly prefers
men to women, which rather bears out the common belief as to the
parrot family's sex-consciousness in their dealings with humans.
I now mention the other oldest inmate, a gorgeous Purple-cap
Lory, who lives up to his name of " Lucifer ", having on one
occasion murdered a lovely cock Plum-head, since when he has been
strictly by himself, except at the Zoo, where he resided for five years
and was provided with a mate in the shape of a Yellow-back Lory,
the only bird he would tolerate. On one occasion in his former days
with me he escaped and flew about the country for over a week,
feasting on strawberries, etc., in some fruit gardens about four
miles away, till he was lured down by a Blue-fronted Amazon belong-
ing to the owner of the aforesaid gardens, entered an empty cage,
and was claimed by me. So you see, his career has been somewhat
adventurous. By the way, I should imagine this species is a far
easier bird to keep than the Swainson's Lorrikeet, if I may judge
from my one and only specimen. He arrived in Sussex on a raw
November day in 1923, having come from Yorkshire in a wooden
box, no paper, and merely strips of wood over the top to keep
him in ! He has lived on bread and milk, not always sweet (when
I was away from home), in an open cage in those infernal regions
for most birds--a large greenhouse--sweltering by day, and
correspondingly cold at night, with (as I didn't know better in
those days) frequent bites at an orange. This I now believe to be
fatal to any milk-feeding bird, the combination of milk in any
form and the acid from oranges, etc., being, I believe in most cases,
most dangerous, and probably accounting for many people's failure
to keep lories, etc., on a milk sop diet. I imagine if fed on melons
and honey the above would not apply. He and all my birds which
are not outdoors are now in roomy box cages in a large room,
but will mostly go out either by day, on fine days, or altogether in
the summer. " Lucifer " will then meet his old flame, my hen
Rosy Cockatoo, with whom he was always most loving, sitting and
combing her head, a charming picture.

The other members of the family here are a gorgeous pair--cock
Red Collar and hen Swainson's--and perhaps the nicest bird I have
after " Dawn ", my little talking Swainson's cock. This bird came
from Keston last May, being priced very low, as he had no tail!
The weather being fine, I at once turned him out in an aviary and
gave him a little millet, canary, and a cup of bread and milk.
However, a few days later, I found him on the floor, looking rather
puffed out. Next day he was worse, being apparently paralysed,
except for his head. I took him in, placing him in a box cage in
the greenhouse, feeling sure that it was hopeless, but that as he was
paralysed he could not be in pain. I placed his Bread and milk
in a saucer, and he would drag himself to it at times and sip a
little, but his feet were tightly curled, and the only live part of him
seemed to be his head ! However, in a few days, he became slightly
better and, except for a slight relapse, completely recovered, except
that one foot, although he can use it, still remains curled or
crumpled up except when climbing. He has remained in that cage,
and now says his name, " Hullo, Cupid," in a small husky voice,
shakes hands, plays with a piece of wood, mimics the Cockatoos,
the creaking of a yard door outside the bird-room, and I have even
heard him trying to coo like a pair of white Doves in a cage near
him. His colouring is splendid. Incidentally, I must have colour,
a plain-hued bird, no matter how tame or sweet-voiced, doesn't
attract me.
To pass on, a glorious cock Pennant, an equally lovely cock
Blossom (Plum) Head (surely these two are the most, or among the
most, beautiful of all the parrot family), sundry Budgies of all
shades, and a pair of (I trust) breeding Cockateals complete my
" Parrots ". At the top of the other birds I must mention two
jewel-like Royal Starling cocks, one of which will take mealworms
from the hand. A lovely Amethyst cock died suddenly about a
month ago, apparently perfect in the morning, I found him dead
at night. And as if this was not a staggering blow in itself, next
day my Superb Tanager cock also departed-verdict: " Enlarged
heart and liver " (he had only been with me for a month). Now
we come to an important point in feeding, this time regarding

Tanagers. I seemed to have heard that much banana is very bad
for them, and yet when one receives one of these lovely birds it
frequently arrives with the remains of what must have been a whole
fruit of this kind, at least twice the length of the bird's body; while
any one who knows these birds will agree that they will, many of
them, demolish a whole banana in a few hours. So my Scarlet cock
and Veillot's cock get Zoo food, mixed with " Secto ", the latter
dry, apple, orange, and an occasional banana, never more than
a quarter or half a day. The two great orders of birds, apart from
the parrot family, which have always attracted me most are the
widely different, but equally fascinating, ones of " Finches " (in the
very widest sense, to bring in the Waxbills and Tanagers) and
" Pheasants ". Of the former, in addition to nearly all the British
ones (including some four or five species of Buntings), I have
Orange-cheek, St. Helena, Common, Gold-crest, Avadavat, Cordon
Bleu, and Yiolet-eared Waxbills, Black-and-white-headed, Tri-
coloured, and Bronze-winged Mannikins, Lavender and Fire-finches,
Gouldians, Cut-throats, grey and white Javas, Saffron Finches,
Nonpareil and Indigo Buntings, Red-crested, Pope, and Viginian
Cardinals, Pekin Robins, and some dozen Roller Canaries. A
large and varied assortment. While in pheasants I have (or had)
Golds, Silvers, Amhersts, Reeves, Swinhoe's, Edward's, Chinese,
Mongolian, Monaul, and Blue Peafowl. In my opinion, a cock
Monaul, with his absolutely " staggering " colouring, is not only
the most beautiful of all pheasants, but possibly of all birds,
although I admit that the ordinary Peacock, the Pennant's
Parrakeet, the cock Golden Pheasant (if this was not common, what
a price it would fetch), and sundry of the African Starlings, run
him fairly close. I use the word beauty to describe what is the
chief beauty to me--that of sheer glorious colour. By the way,
talking of Peafowl, I absolutely disagree with any one who describes
the Green or Javan species as the most beautiful. It lacks, of
course, what is, apart from its " train ", the great beauty of
the common species, its wonderful breast and neck colour. Green
is a beautiful shade or series of shades, but surely, especially in
a bird as big as a Javanese Peacock, it does need a little relief,

unlike red, blue, or purple, a complete coat of which often
makes a very lovely bird. However, I know many people will
disagree
I hope to be able to send you a few breeding results as the
season advances. I forgot, I find in glancing hastily over my list
of birds, to mention Grenadier and Orange Bishops. In my
opinion, the " best lives " among all small foreigners (and how
lovely are the cocks), are Paradise and Pintail Whydahs, Com-
bassous, and Zebra Finches. The latter, I find, are stupid, restless,
and irritating little beasts. If only they would settle down to
breeding like Budgies, instead of playing at it, dying eggbound, etc.

PARTRIDGE AND BULBUL FIGHTING IN
INDIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9675038" page_id="56219681"  page_num="155" year="" vol="">
By Alfred Ezra, O.B.E.
In Calcutta the Indians are very keen on Fighting Partridges,
This bird,which is the Grey Francolin (Francolinus pondicerianus ),
is very often hand reared and kept with great care. The birds are
naturally very tame, and follow their owners about when let out
for exercise in the fields, and never fly away, and will also call at
the owner's orders. They are kept in double cages, the cock bird
in one compartment and the hen in the other. The hen bird is
kept to encourage the cock bird to fight, by calling all the time the
fight is going on. A good deal of betting takes place, and the arena
is surrounded by hundreds of Indians, squatting on their haunches,
with their birds close to them. After a lot of haggling, terms are
arranged, and the two birds matched to fight are let out into the
arena by their owners, and they start fighting at once. The owners
keep encouraging the birds to fight by talking to them incessantly,
and the hens keep calling all the time. A good fight lasts about ten
minutes, and the beaten bird runs away to its owner, or flies away
from the arena. They generally fight viciously to a finish, but very
little damage is done. Only a few feathers flying from the neck,
and, perhaps, from the top of the head, is all the damage done. The

excitement of the Indians is great, and sometimes ends in a free
fight. The winning bird is generally caught up and kissed by all
its backers. The birds, after a few minutes' rest, are quite ready
to fight again. The fight is quite pretty to watch, especially as the
birds seem to enjoy it, and are none the worse after a fight.
Bulbul fighting is also a great sport with the Indians in Calcutta.
The Common Bed-vented Bulbul is generally caught in December,
and a cotton brace is put round its waist, with a long string attached
to it. This string is attached to a lightly made portable iron stand,
The bird is never put in a cage, but spends most of his time on
this iron stand. As the birds are handled all the time, and are
always fed by hand, they get very tame in a very few days. Both
cocks and hens fight. The birds are kept hungry when they are
to fight and, after all the betting is done and terms settled, the two
birds matched to fight are put in the arena, and some suttoo (ground
lentils, largely used in India for feeding birds) is thrown in the
middle. The birds attack one another at once, and fight on the
ground till one is vanquished, when it flies back to his owner. These
fights last only a couple of minutes, and the birds are given honey
and water as a refreshment after the fight. There is not quite so
much excitement over these fights as there is over the partridge
fighting, and a good many boys take part in this sport. The birds
are not damaged in any way, and after January, when the season
for fighting is over, they are given their freedom. In the fighting
they seem to tackle one another's feet most of the time.

India is so full of bird and animal life that each time one visits
it one finds it more and more interesting. In case it should interest
our readers, I shall give roughly the birds and animals that were
seen by Mr. Delacour and me on our visit to India last w t inter. On
our way from Bombay to Agra we saw : Episcopal Storks, Jabirus,

In the sanctuary at Bikaner we saw any number of wild boars,
chinkaras, foxes, Grey Francolins (Partridges).
On the 27th November we saw about six hundred Demoiselle
Cranes, one Grey Heron, some Stilts, Cormorants, Ducks, Dab-
chicks, Peafowl, and Spotted Sandgrouse. All these were seen at
Bikaner.
At Gagner, about twenty miles from the Palace at Bikaner there
were some duck including a few Marble Teal, one Heron, White-
backed Vultures, nesting close to my room, one small Grey
Hornbill, Silverbills, and Grey Babblers (Argya malcolmi),
Imperial Sandgrouse, two Houbara Bustards (Chlamydotis
macquenni).
On the 3rd December at Talwara Jheel, a night's journey
by train, 650 duck were shot, including a hybrid Mallard
x Pintail and two Marble Teal. We saw thousands and thousands
of birds, and at times the sky was overcast with them--mostly
Pintail, and Teal, also Mallard, Shovellers, few Red-crested

small waders. Next day near Haumangark saw 2,000 Teal, shot
fifty Common Snipe and some Jack Snipe, many Houbaras, Black
Buck, and Nilghai. 7th December saw between 5,000 and 6,000
Black Buck, not more than 200 yards away from our motor cars.
This was a most wonderful sight and one that we shall never forget.
A lot of Sandgrouse--Spotted, Imperial, Common, and Pintailed--
sixty-four Houbara Bustard, Imperial Eagles attacking Houbara
Bustard. The following birds are conspicuous in Bikaner : Pied
Chat (winter visitor), White-headed Chat (winter visitor), Indian
Grey Shrike, Bay-backed Shrikes. Saw 4,000 Demoiselle Cranes.
9th December, on the way to Jaipore. A large salt lake with
a lot of Flamingos and Pelicans. In the guest house garden,
Sunbirds, Zosterops, Hoopoes, Brown-backed Bobins, Coppersmith
Barbets. There was a very good 300 at Jaipore.
11th December on the way to Kotah lots of Drawf Turtle
Doves and Painted Storks (Tantalus), Bulbuls, Francolins,
Barbets, Treepies, Blue-throat, Fantailed Flycatchers, and
Ruddy Sheldrake on the river, also Black Storks. On a visit to
Mr. Dodd's shooting camp, near Calcutta, we saw Cotton Teal,
Owlets, Serpent Eagles, and other birds of prey, Kingfishers,
Zosterops, Jacanas, Orange-headed Ground Thrushes, Coursers, and
Snipe. India undoubtedly is the most wonderful country for birds
and beasts, and the thing that strikes one most is the tameness
of the birds.

As some readers of our Magazine are interested in the nesting
of birds, I herewith give a few notes on the nesting of my birds
in 1933:--
Rothschild's Grackle (Leucopsar rothschildi) . These birds
were most disappointing last year. They did nothing but build
nests and destroy them; laid one egg which was promptly

eaten. It seems such a pity not to establish these birds, which are
so rare and so interesting.
Chinese Blackbirds (Turdus mandarinus) . Several eggs were
laid and incubated. Young hatched but none reared. The longest
a young one was fed and lived was fourteen days.
Crowned Starling (Galeopsar Salvadorii) . The old pair that
have reared young each year had laid three eggs by the 9th May.
Three young were hatched out by the 24th May. Two of these
were found dead on the 29th, but the third one was fully reared,
leaving the nest on the 23rd June. Three more eggs were laid by
the 21st July. Two young were hatched out but only one reared.
I have let the hen bird out as soon as she had laid her eggs, and
the cock bird was kept in a cage in the aviary--the same method
that I used the last two years.
Slenderbill Starling (Cinnamopterus tenuirostris) . I am
again unable to report any success with these handsome birds. In
all two eggs were laid by the 8th June and one young one was
hatched out by the 23rd June. It died the same day, and the
second egg was broken. On 20th July there were three more eggs
in the nest. All fertile but none were hatched.
Wonga Wonga Pigeon (Leucosarcia picata). Laid two eggs
by the 27th March. These were incubated for ten days only and
then deserted. Two more eggs were laid by the 2nd May, and one
young hatched out on the 19th May. The other egg was infertile.
The young one lived for one month, but did not leave the nest and
was found dead. It was fully feathered and quite as big as its
parents.
American Bluebird (Sialia siaUs). Two eggs were laid by the
2nd April, but owing to the very cold weather these did not hatch
out. Four more eggs were laid by the 2nd May, and these were
only incubated nine days when the birds started to build again.
These birds are getting very old, so I do not expect them to rear
young successfully.
White-winged Mynah (Sturnia nemoricolor) . Four eggs were
laid by the 5th May and two young were hatched out on the 19th.
One young one was picked up dead two days later, and the other

one left the nest on the 4th June, but only lived for three days.
By the 17th June three more eggs were laid, but these disappeared
and no further attempts at nesting were made by these birds.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.811817">

eggs were laid by the 12th May and two young hatched out by
the 26th May. One young one was found dead six days later, the
other young one left the nest on the 20th June, and by the 26th
it was feeding itself. Three more eggs were found on the 6th July
and all hatched out on the 14th July, but these only lived for twelve
days. Another three eggs were laid by the 23rd August and two
young were hatched out on the 6th September, the third egg being
infertile. One young one left the nest on the 28th September and
the other one the next day. Both are now feeding themselves.
Fytche's Partridge (Bambusicola fytchii ). One egg was found
broken on the 19th June, another on the 26th June. A nest con-
taining one egg was found on the 30th June, and this hatched
out on the 19th July. A rather queer thing took place during the
rearing of the young one. The hen bird was always accompanied
by two males, and the three of them took a hand in rearing the
young one, and all agreed quite well together. This is the second
year that these partridges have reared young here.
Zebra Doves (Geopelia sinica). A pair of these went to nest
and two eggs were laid by the 14th April. Although the birds sat
well nothing came of this first venture, and both eggs were found
broken on the floor. One egg contained a partly-formed chick and
the other one was infertile. No further signs of a nest was seen
until the morning of the 4th June. A young bird was picked up
dead having apparently been killed on leaving the nest. After
a good search the nest was found in some ivy, containing another
young one. This one left the nest on the following day. Two
more eggs were seen in the same nest on the 16th June, and one
young one was hatched on the 1st July. This one was reared,
leaving the nest on the 21st July. Another two eggs were laid by
the 24th July, but somehow or other the nest was upset and both
eggs were broken. On the 25th August another young one was
noticed, having just left the nest, but this nest was never found.

On the 16th September a nest with two young ones was found in
the ivy. Two days later both were found dead.
Roul Roul Partridges (Rollulus roulroul) . These very
handsome Partridges have laid several eggs most of which have
been eaten up. On three occasions eggs were saved, and on the
22nd June one egg was placed under a domestic hen, but
unfortunately it was crushed by the hen the day that it was
hatching out. A second egg was placed in an incubator on the
19th August, and this one was hatched out on the 7th September.
The young one lived for six days and seemed perfectly healthy and
strong, but for some unknown reason it died suddenly.
Shama (Kittocincla malabarica). Five eggs were laid by the
18th May and all hatched out by the 31st, but the male bird
killed all the young ones by the 3rd June. Another five eggs were
laid by the 14th June and four young were hatched out by the 27th.
The male bird was caged up this time and the hen left to feed the
young. All went well for three days, then the hen refused to
have anything to do with the young. The only thing left to do
was to let the hen have her liberty, and see if she would then
feed her young. As soon as the door of the aviary was opened she
flew out, and was seen to go into some bushes nearby, returning
shortly with a beak full of insects. At last it looked as if this
would do the trick, but our hopes were soon shattered, as the bird,
after going in and out of the aviary several times, wandered farther
afield and found new interest in chasing other birds, and at night
she did not return to the aviary. The next day she was seen
about and then she suddenly disappeared. I am afraid she was
killed by some other birds. Another pair were just as dis-
appointing, and one egg was laid on the 5th May, but the birds
would not incubate it. Another egg was laid on the 22nd May,
and this one was incubated and a young one was hatched out on
the 5th June. This young one was found dead the next day.
Another two eggs were laid by the 17th June and one young one
hatched out on the 1st July. Both parents fed this one well for
twelve days, but on the 14th July it was found dead on the floor
of the aviary.

Madagascar Partridges (Margaroperdix madagascariensis).

<bodyText confidence="0.9879428" page_id="56219692"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
Three pairs of these Partridges laid twenty-nine eggs in all, and
some of these were placed under domestic hens, and some in an
incubator. Sixteen young were successfully reared. The males
attain their adult plumage at the first moult.
African Wattled Plover (Lobivanellus lateralis). After
laying four eggs by the 8th May, these birds began incubating in
a very poor fashion as they were very seldom seen near the eggs.
On the morning of the 19th June two eggs were noticed to be
hatching, and by noon they had disappeared from the nest. After
a search two young ones were found on the path at the far side
of the aviary. One was dead and the other one was kept alive
for thirty-six hours, but it was impossible to get it to eat anything.
I hope we shall yet be successful in breeding this very handsome
Plover.
Pied Grallina (Grallina picata). One egg was laid on the
27th April, but this was infertile. Two more eggs were laid in the
samq nest by the 8th June. One young was hatched out by the
23rd June. The other egg was infertile. The young one was
thrown out of the nest the next day. They again went to
nest and one egg was laid by the 22nd July, which was broken
six days later.
Superb Starling (Spero superbus). Several young ones
were hatched but as soon as they left the nest they were killed by
the Jays and Magpies in the aviary. In some cases the young were
even taken from the nest.
Royal Starling (Cosmopsarus regius). Two pairs of these
lovely birds built nests, but only one pair showed any interest in
the nest after it was built. One egg was laid on the 31st May, and
both birds took turn at incubating it. Unfortunately the egg was
infertile.
Amethyst Starling (Cinnyrinchus leucogasta). A pair of
these built a nest, consisting of leaves with a little mud added in
a bamboo log. The hen was frequently in this nest for long
intervals, but it was impossible to look into the nest as the bamboo
was eighteen inches long and the entrance hole was near one end

and the nest itself was near the other end. On the 27th June
one egg was found broken on the floor of the aviary flight, and
the next day the hen bird was noticed to have another broken
egg hanging from her feathers. As she did not take any further
interest in the nest, it was taken down but there were no more
eggs in it. As this is the first time these birds have laid here,
we may be more fortunate the next time they nest.
Pekin Robins (Liothrix lutea). Six of these birds in one
aviary made several nests, but as soon as an egg was laid it was
promptly eaten up by one or the other of the Robins. The few
of these birds that I turned out last year have disappeared from
the garden.
Bronze-winged Pigeons (Phaps chalcoptera ). Although two
pairs of these Pigeons were continually nesting, and several young
were hatched, only three were fully reared. In most cases as soon
as the young left the nest, the parents gave up feeding them and
started nesting again.
Sw inhoe's Pheasant-tailed Pigeons (Macropygia swinhoei).
Owing to the roughness of the nest made by these Pigeons nearly
every egg that was laid was not properly incubated, as they fell
through the twigs to the bottom of the baskets that are hung up
for nesting purposes. Only one young was successfully reared
after the baskets had been half filled with straw.
Crowned Lapwing (Stephanibix coronatus). These birds chose
a very awkward place for their nest which was on the pathway
against the door leading from the small flight to a large one. The
first egg was laid on the 28th April. This disappeared the same
day. Another one was laid on the 30th, and a Madagascar
Partridge was seen eating this later in the day. Two more eggs
were laid by the 1st July. These were incubated for five days,
and on the 6th day both eggs were found broken. Two more
eggs laid by the 12th August were taken away and placed in an
incubator, and one young was hatched out on the 9th September.
This one only lived for seven days.
Purple-headed Glossy Starling (Lamprocolius auratus).
A pair of these birds were continually building nests and then

destroying them. On the 6th July we were surprised to find a
nest containing three eggs. Three young were hatched out on the
15th July. Two of these were found dead on the 27th, but
the other one was successfully reared, leaving the nest on the
5th August. Five days after leaving the nest this one was fending
for itself. This is the first time these birds have been bred here,
and I hope now that they have started they will continue to breed.
Californian Quail (Lophortyx californicus) . One pair of
these pretty birds laid nine eggs and were then disturbed by a
pair of Madagascar Partridges. Some time later another nest was
found containing nineteen eggs. All these hatched out on the
29th June. Three were found drowned next day, four mysteriously
disappeared, but the other twelve were successfully reared. Another
pair laid in all sixty-eight eggs, but no nest was made, and the
eggs were laid all over the place. These eggs were collected and
placed under a Bantam, but a mole upset the nest just before
the eggs were due to hatch. Another lot was placed in an
incubator, but this also was a failure. Although a good many
chicks were hatched none of them would feed.
White-winged Wydah (Coliuspasser albonotata). Several
nests were built by these birds, and every one contained eggs, but
only three lots were hatched out. All young disappeared after a
few days. There are too many of these birds together to hope for
any success.
Orange-headed Ground Thrush (Geocichla citrina). Although
I have two pairs of these birds only one pair nested. Two eggs
were laid by the 6th July and one young one was hatched out on
the 19th. The other egg was infertile. The young bird was thrown
out of the nest later in the day. No further attempt was made
at nesting.
Long-tailed Grassfinch (Poephila acuticauda). There are five
of these birds together in an aviary with all kinds of small Wax-
bills and Finches. Although several nests were constructed and
numerous eggs laid, no attempt was made at incubating.
White-crested Jay Thrush (Garrulax diardi). These birds
have again been very disappointing. Although they hatched off

several young ones, on no occasion would they feed them. They were
always thrown out of the nest, and the parents started building
again.
Tambourine Doves (Tympanistria tympanistria) . Three pairs
of these doves nested here, and on five or six occasions hatched off
young, but unfortunately none were successfully reared. In every
case when the young were from ten to fourteen days old they tried
to leave the nest, and were killed in dropping from the nest to the
floor of the aviary shelter.
A hen Green Singing Finch, mated to a cock Alario Finch,
nested three times, and laid in all ten eggs. All were infertile.
Cape Canary (Serinus canicollis) . A pair of these birds built
a nest resembling a linnet's nest in a box bush. Two eggs were laid.
One was broken, but the other one was hatched, and the young
left the nest at the end of May. Further attempts at nesting were
spoilt by other birds in the aviary destroying the nests.
Chinese Painted Quail (Excalfact or ia chinensis) . Although
no nests were made, several eggs were found in different places in
the aviary. We made a rough nest for them, but we could not
induce the birds to enter it and incubate the eggs we had placed
in it.
Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet (Polytelis alexandrse). The
old pair laid five eggs by the 12th April, and three young were
hatched out by the 25th. One was found dead three days later,
and another one died when twelve days old. The third one was
reared, leaving the nest on the 5th June. The cock bird, which had
been removed during the incubation and rearing of the young, was
returned to the aviary. They nested again and four eggs were laid
by the 30th June. One young hatched out on the 14th July, two
eggs contained dead chicks, and the fourth egg was infertile. The
young one left the nest on the 20th August. It is a fine healthy
bird. Another pair in another aviary went to nest, laying six
eggs by the 25th April, and two young were hatched out by the 7th
May. Both young were found dead three days later, and the other
four eggs were infertile. The above pair were bred here in 1931.
These birds again laid six eggs by the 30th May, but all of these

were infertile. They went to nest a third time, again laying six
eggs. Unfortunately all these eggs were broken by the cock bird.
Another pair of these lovely Parrakeets, that were bred here in
1932, went to nest, and two eggs were laid by the 2nd June. Neither
of these hatched out, although both contained chicks. Two more
eggs were laid by the 9th July, both of which were infertile.
Ring-necked Parrakeet (Psittacula krameri). A lutino hen,
mated to a green cock, laid four eggs by the 27th March. One
young was hatched out by the 21st April, the other three eggs were
infertile. The young was fully reared. Another lutino hen, mated
to a green male, laid three eggs by the 2nd April, and two young
ones were hatched out on the 30th April, the third egg being
infertile. When these two young were fully reared and were about
to leave the nest they came to an untimely end through a swarm
of bees getting into the nest-box. An account of this appeared
in an earlier Magazine last year. Both these young birds were
the healthiest I have ever bred. A third pair of Ring-necks, both
lutinos, laid four eggs. All contained dead chicks. Four more eggs
were laid by the 5th May, and one young hatched out on the 2nd
June. Expectations ran high, whether it would be as yellow as the
parents, and would it be reared, and enable it to be recorded that
a lutino had been bred here at last. Another disappointment was in
store, as it turned out to be a green and, although it appeared quite
healthy in the nest, it had only left the nest three days when it
died of rickets. This pair, both lutinos, have never reared a young
one yet that was strong and healthy. In fact, this was the only
one reared, as all the other eggs had dead chicks in them. A hen
Ring-necked Parrakeet mated to a cock Alexandrine x Ring-neck
hybrid, laid five eggs by the 28th March, and three young were
hatched out by 21st April. These left the nest on 16th June. They
appear to be a trifle bigger than Ring-necked Parrakeets.
Alexandrine Parrakeet (Psittacula nipalensis ). The old blue
cock was paired to his own daughter, and the first egg was laid on
the 2nd March. Three eggs were laid in all. Two of these were
infertile, and the third one contained a partly-formed chick.

Another pair of these, both blue bred, laid two eggs by the 27th
March, but would not incubate, so the eggs were removed and placed
under a Ring-necked Parrakeet. Both eggs were infertile. I don't
think these birds are old enough to breed, and hope they will be
better next year. This pair again laid three eggs by the 13th April,
and one young one was hatched out on the 13th May. This was
unfortunately found dead the next day. The other eggs contained
dead chicks. Another pair of these Parrakeets, both lutinos, went
to nest, and three eggs were laid by the 23rd January. All were
infertile. They again laid three eggs by the 20th March, and one
young was hatched out on the 21st April. This was found dead
the next day, buried underneath the peat moss in the nest-box, and
the other two eggs were infertile. Another pair, both green, laid
four eggs by the 5th February, and three young ones were hatched
out by the 12th March. One young one was found dead on the 17th,
and the other two were found to have been brutally murdered the
next day, apparently the work of the parents, as nothing else can
get into the aviary. They again went to nest, and four more eggs
were laid, and three of these were hatched out by the 7th May. One
young was found dead the next day, the other two were reared,
leaving the nest on the 16th July.
Barraband' s Parrakeet (Poly tells swainsoni ). These birds have
been most disappointing, as, although five young were hatched by the
24th April, two died two days later, the other three were looking
splendid and being fed well for eight days, but for some reason the
parents gave up feeding and two young were found dead on the
13th April. The remaining one was taken away and hand reared.
They again went to nest, and three eggs were laid by the 31st May,
but the birds would not incubate them.
Malabar Parrakeet (P. peristeroides ). Three eggs were laid
by the 16th April, and two young were hatched out on the 15th
May. The third egg was broken. One young left the nest on the
1st July, and the other tw T o days later, both being extremely fine
healthy birds.

reared. This being the first Derbyan reared in Europe. A report
concerning this appeared in the Magazine last year.
Layard's Parrakeet (P. calthropse). The cock bird appears to
be sterile as altogether nine eggs were laid. None of them was
fertile.
Turquoisine Parrakeet (Neophema pulcliella). Four eggs were
laid by 20th June. Two were found broken three days later, one
was infertile, and the fourth contained a dead chick.
Elegant Parrakeet (N. elegans). The old pair that bred here
last year did not have any fertile eggs this year, although three
separate clutches were laid. Another pair, the male which was
bred here in 1932 was paired to a hen that has been here some
years, laid four eggs by the 29th April, All the eggs were broken
ten days later.
In the animal enclosure I was successful in rearing the following
birds :--
White Peafowl. Eight.
Mandarin Duck. Twenty were reared by full-winged birds in
the nest-boxes put up for them in trees.
Maned Geese. Four were reared.
Madagascar White-backed Duck. This pair of birds had two
nests. One young reared out of the first clutch, and four out of the
second clutch.
A good many Carolinas, Meller's, Bahamas, and Chestnut-
breasted Duck w T ere reared. A pure white Bahama was also reared.
Black-necked Swans did not nest.
Crane. One Sarus Crane was reared by the full-winged pair
about half a mile from the enclosure. Young one was brought into
the enclosure by the parents as soon as it could fly. I have eight
of these lovely birds full-winged now.
Hundreds of Chukor Partridges and Jungle Fowl were reared
at liberty, also a good many pheasants.
The amount of failures in the above list is most disheartening,
but on the other hand success is all the more appreciated when
something out of the way is reared.

ISLAND LIFE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998243263157895" page_id="56219699"  page_num="169" year="" vol="">
Skokholm is one of three or four small islands situated just off the
coast of Pembrokeshire, washed by the Atlantic and often unapproach-
able for days together when the sea is unkind. It is the home of Choughs
and Ravens, Puffins, Shearwaters, Guillemots, Kazorbills, and Stormy
Petrels, not to mention seals and rabbits. In spring and autumn it
is the resting-place of many migrants. Once thoroughly farmed, it
had been left untilled for years, until in fact its present owner discovered
and acquired it. Its house was restored, a garden formed, and now the
owner, his wife, and baby daughter find it a fascinating home. It would
not perhaps be everybody's choice, but the owner and his wife, being
true naturalists, find the life there all they could wish.
In Island Life (H. F. &amp; G. Witherby, Is. 6 d. net) Mr. Lockley
describes this life with great charm, while his wife's sketches, the work
of no mean artist, add greatly to its value, as do a fine series of
photographs. This is a sequel to a former book by the same author
entitled Bream Days , which those who read the sequel will wish to obtain
also. We can only say that Island Days will give those who read it
a few hours of very great enjoyment, especially if they possess a love
of wild nature.

It is with deep regret that we have to record the death of Mr. Gerard
Gurney, of Keswick Hall, Norwich, which took place there on 18th May.
Mr. Gurney was an enthusiastic and successful aviculturist and
a very good all-round ornithologist as his father and grandfather had
been before him. His grandfather had a world-wide knowledge of the
raptorial birds and founded the wonderful collection of Birds of Prey
in the Norwich Museum, while his father, who died in 1922, was the
greatest authority on the Birds of the Eastern Counties.

Correspondence
Mr. Gerard Gurney joined the Avicultural Society in 1918 and since
then has published many valuable papers in our journal. He possessed
magnificent aviaries at Keswick and a splendid collection of rare birds,
and, although always delicate, his untimely death at the age of 54, has
come as a great shock to all who knew him.
Our members will wish to tender their sincerest sympathy to his
mother in the loss of her only son.

surrounded with 18 in. and 36 in. galvanized iron sheets, leaving not even
a |--in. strip of wood uncovered for mice to scale--mice having been a source
of trouble to me last year ; the wire-netting is doubled at the back of the
galvanized iron sheets and buried a good 18 inches into the ground.
Block " B " is 18 feet square and divided into three divisions from 8 to
10 feet in height, the difference being due to the slope of the ground. In it

favourites of mine, viz. New Zealand Zoster ops and Rainbow Buntings ; the
wire of this block is of f in. mesh and a strong gauge, newly wired during the
winter, and there is also a safety door.
Block " C " (of which I cannot do a photograph) houses in two divisions
a few pairs of Budgerigars, and in a large flight shaped like a letter L

The cock bird is an adult red-head, the hen a black-head, bred by us
in February, 1933. At the early age of ten months she went to nest, which
resulted five weeks later in six absolutely perfect youngsters appearing from
the nest.
The young birds were left with the parents until we were quite satisfied
that they were capable of fending for themselves when they were removed
to separate quarters.
About a month after their removal the hen was sitting again and the
second nest produced four youngsters of equal calibre to the first six.
Six weeks ago the birds were still in such perfect condition and free from
any signs of moult that we gave them their nesting-box again, and they
made a very good start by producing a nest of young, as we could tell by
the noise from the nest at feeding time.
It was at this stage that our first troubles of the year began. The parents
started fighting to such an extent that all thoughts of feeding the young
became secondary to their desire to maim each other.
Something had to be done, so we took the cock away. The hen has fed
and brought out yet four more of the finest young Gouldians I ever wish
to see. Amongst the total of fourteen youngsters not one has ever looked
back, and the first signs of rough feather has iust started with the moult
of the first two broods towards adult plumage, although their health is perfect.

PHEASANTS

<bodyText confidence="0.9949114" page_id="56219703"  page_num="171" year="" vol="">
Regarding the communication from Mr. P. W. Teague regarding the age
of Silver Pheasants. I have a Golden Amherst Hybrid cock which I bred
in 1920. When about three weeks old, one of its legs was accidentally broken
in moving a coop. I was just about to screw its neck, when a friend who
happened to be with me at the time suggested putting it in splints. This
we did and the bird recovered and grew into a very fine Pheasant, but during
the last few years it has walked with a slight limp, no doubt due to the effect
of the early fracture. This Pheasant is quite a pet and practically tame.
On several occasions, when I have been short of aviary room, I have put it
in the poultry run. I have also had it loose in the garden but, on account
of cats, I now keep it permanently in an aviary. This bird seems to get
better plumage every year, and has now an enormous tail.
An extraordinary thing about Golden and Amherst Pheasants is their
liking for snow. During the very heavy snow-storm last year, I went out
one night, and found all the Golden and Amherst Pheasants sleeping out
in the snow r . I went to pick them up for dead, but found they were quite
lively, and they seemed to be none the worse for it next day.
Regarding a cross between the Silver Pheasant and the Golden Pheasant.
I think this is a very extraordinary cross, although I have heard of it once
before. Mr. Irving, of Belfast, has a cross between a Reeves and a Swinhoe,
which is the first I have ever heard of.
I bred last year a cross between a Golden Pheasant cock, and a Game
Bantam hen. This cross is a beautifully shaped bird, and walks with great
style. The most remarkable thing about it is that it is bigger than either
parent. It also seems wilder, and I should like to turn it out among the

poultry but I am afraid it would stray. I wonder if any of the readers of
the Magazine have had any experience on letting these Hybrids between
Domestic Fowls and Pheasants run loose.
If your correspondent of Sydney, Australia, will write me, I will find him
some literature on Pheasant keeping.
It may be interesting to readers to know that there are more people
keeping fancy Pheasants now than ever before. No doubt all this is due to
the persistent efforts of Mr. P. Lambert. Thousands of people interested
in birds have never seen any of the rarer kinds of Pheasants, but if they saw
them and could only be convinced that they required very little attention
and were hardy, they would take them up at once.

THE VALUE OF VITAMINS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999134904761905" page_id="56219704"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
Now that, owing to the difficulty of procuring fresh stock, the breeding
of aviary birds is becoming more important than it used to be, it is worth
while to follow up the latest scientific data about the foods at our command.
Investigation indicates that the vitamin contents of the various foods is
of greater importance to breeding stock than it was generally given credit for,
and that Vitamin E is especially necessary in this respect.
I am undertaking here a series of experiments with this ingredient in the
hope of being able to increase the fertility of cage animals and birds, but
results would be more conclusive if done on a wide scale, and I wish to suggest
that some of the members of the Avicultural Society, who are interested in
breeding birds, should also try out the effect of vitamins on their breeding
stock. Generally speaking I have found them infinitely superior to chemical
mixtures. The quickest and more effective way to stop a case of feather-picking
is to give the bird " Radio Malt ", manufactured by British Drug Houses, Ltd.
This contains Vitamins A, B, and D.
Vitamin E, which is so essentia] to fertility, is found in several green
substances such as bananas, pea-pods, carrots, lettuce, tea, but principally
in the germ of wheat. This latter is a by-product in the manufacture of flour.
It is probably, as far as health goes, the most important part of the grain,
but owing to the fad for white bread it is discarded and given to the fowls,
to the detriment of the Nation's manhood. I am trying the effect of this on

In this beautiful book the author-artist does for the Budgerigars what he
has done for the Finches in his book on those beautiful birds.
A wealth of informative matter published and contributed by well-known
European and Australian breeders has been carefully collated. This, together
with Mr. Cayley's personal experiences, will undoubtedly prove of great value
to the thousands of enthusiasts interested in these beautiful Parrots. Chapters
on the history of the species, its habits in the bush and aviary, housing, feeding,
breeding, and management, colour production and varieties, its training as a
talker and pet , and diseases and their treatment, make it an outstanding book
on the subject. ___

I think the introduction of this beautiful finch to this country is
quite a landmark in aviculture. Why it has been so long delayed I don't
know unless it is the difficulty and expense in getting to the far-off
islands where it lives.
It was first described by Dr. Sclater in 1881 from a skin collected
by Captain Kenneth Howard, B.N., on the island of Epi in the New
Hebrides, and this skin and a spirit specimen are still the only ones
in the British Museum. American collectors, however, were out there
a few years ago, and got a good series of skins from the type locality
and other small islands near by, which together form what is known
as the Shepherd Group. It was to these islands Mr. Shaw Mayer and
I went.
For a long time I had had this bird in my mind hoping one day to
be the first to get it alive, but the great drawback was, that these
islands are very poor in bird life, and there was nothing else there to
make it worth while in case of failure. Last year when Mr. Mayer
returned from New Guinea I found he had been considering the same
thing, so we joined forces and set out. I must say though that when
we left England it was perhaps more with the intention of going to

New Guinea, but as we bad first to go to Australia in either case, we
decided to leave it open until we got to Sydney and saw how the
boats fitted in. When we found there was one leaving for the New
Hebrides in five days we made up our minds to risk it, as it was by no
means certain if regias would be in sufficient numbers to pay expenses,
and I am afraid they were not.
Vila, the only port in the islands, is some ten days from Sydney,
and from there on it is difficult to get to some of the islands, and always
with great delay, so if we made a wrong choice much time would be
lost and great expense incurred. This is one of the drawbacks in going
to the more out of the way small islands, some of which are so unhealthy,
and the chance of getting any accommodation at all uncertain, as
camping out during six months of the year is quite out of the question
owing to the possibility of hurricanes which periodically devastate the
islands. Two such occurred last year on the island where we collected,
and one last January while we were there, of which more later.
Several species of Parrot Pinches inhabit the New Hebrides.
I doubt if there is one island without any. Close around the little
settlement of Port Vila we saw small flocks of the Blue Paced E. trichroa
every day feeding on the grass seeds in the coco-nut plantations ; and
on some of the islands farther north (Ambrym for one) the Blue
Collared E. serena and the Blue Faced are both to be found. The
former of these, also a beautiful bird, was first discovered as far back
as 1860 when MacGillivray procured one on the island of Aneyteum
right down south. This distribution is rather curious as typical regias
also inhabit an island in the Banks Group in the extreme north, while
the intervening islands have other subspecies. We thought it best to
go to the type locality and get true regias, which after all is the most
beautiful of all the Parrot Pinches either from the New Hebrides or
elsewhere. When in full plumage I think there is no doubt that it is
the most beautiful finch known. Gouldians look pale and washed out
in comparison with the striking contrast of the scarlet, blue, and green
of the regias, and I may as well say here that it seems to be as Lardy
as any finch known. Out of all ours we only lost three. One of these
we had to destroy because of a deformed leg, and the other two escaped
in Tahiti on our way home when the cages were being cleaned out

under very difficult conditions. What our birds bad to go through and
survived only ourselves know. We changed to three boats before we
got home, and sometimes this was late at night after the birds had
gone to bed. Colon on the Panama Canal was one port where we
changed from a French boat to an English one. The cages were lowered
by ropes over the side into a launch at 10 o'clock at night, and none
too gently either, and then left in the Custom's shed all night on shore.
To hear the birds dashing about it seemed as if they would all be
fatally injured.
After we arrived at Vila from Sydney our steamer was making a
special trip to some of the principal islands, so we took advantage of
this to become acquainted with them before deciding on a collecting
ground. In this way we visited Malekula where the natives are still
cannibals inland, Espiritu Santo, Pentecost, Tangoa, and many others,
finally returning to Vila. A week later we embarked on a still smaller
boat, indescribably dirty, for our final destination, which we reached
after three days. I shall always see the picture in my mind of this
beautiful island as we approached it in the early morning through a sea
like glass. It rose before us mountainous, and clothed in tropical
verdure to its summits, and how we scanned it through our glasses to
see if we could detect any open grassy spaces where the finches
would be likely to feed, but in vain. The boat only stopped long
enough to put us and our baggage ashore and then was off again.
Had she stayed longer I really believe after we had been on shore a
day we should have re-embarked and chosen another island as this
seemed so unpromising. We neither saw any of the finches nor any
ground where they would be likely to feed (from our point of view), nor
even any suitable grasses, neither did the natives seem to know the
birds we were after. It was several days before we could make them
understand, and longer before we definitely got its true native name,
although we had the assistance of two white traders who spoke the
language. We had mentioned the redhead, so they jumped to the
conclusion that it was the Cardinal Honey-eater Myzomelas cardinalis
we wanted and gave its name " susupaumiel ". At length after inter-
viewing scores of natives we made them understand, and found the
right name, which is " Taputi " ; the " u " is pronounced like a double

" o ", and means a " grass-plucker In some of the villages they called
it " Taput " without the final " i When asked where they were to
be found, they pointed to the great banyan trees. My experience of
other species of the family was that they went in flocks, fed on the
ground, and were easy to catch, so we were inclined to think that we
might still be on the wrong track, but when they told us the Americans
on the yacht " La France " had been after the same bird a few years
before, we thought they must be right, as we knew they had collected
skins of regias on this island. We found one might live there for months
or even years and never see a regia, because after all it is true they live
in the tops of trees and feed on fruit. In a way it is practically a fruit-
beating finch. Two traders who had lived there for years had never
seen the bird or heard of it, neither had the only white woman, the
daughter of the pioneer missionary, who was born and brought up on
the island and spoke the language like a native. I mention this to show
how concealed the birds must be in their tree-tops, and this on an
island where the number of species is very small.
There are several kinds of Ficus or Banyan trees growing on the
islands, so one or other is never without fruit, and it is on these the
regias feed. Some of these trees are simply stupendous, but the one
they liked best is called " nambulifer " with the accent on the second
syllable, and after that " naida ". The others were not of much con-
sequence so far as their fruits were concerned, and I imagine they
only eat them when times were hard. The " nambulifer " was the
size of a large cherry, dark maroon on the outside. The birds bite
through the rather hard outer flesh to get at the tiny fig-like seeds
embedded in a sweet pulp in the centre, which they crack and eat ;
so it is easy to understand why they have such strong bills for their
size. When feeding they pluck a ripe fruit and carry it to a stout
branch, where holding it under their strong claws, peck through the
outer part until they reach the seeds, and each bird always returned
to the same branch it had chosen. By watching this and placing lime
there, was the way they were caught. This was tedious work as they
were only obtained one by one and sometimes for days together none
at all. Of course we had to have native help here, and like all such
people, although they were well paid, quickly tired of the work as the

novelty wore off, and left ns ; in fact, most of them seemed to think it
derogatory to catch birds at all except for food, and laughed at those
who did. We never found one man who carried on right through to
the end. It was rather surprising how few full plumaged birds were
caught. We must have had quite twenty before we got one with a
red head, although at the last they were rather more numerous.
We arrived on the island in early December, and some of those
caught then still showed the iridescent lumps at the gape, and had more
or less yellow bills of the very young birds, so I think they commence
to breed in October or even earlier. A nest containing three very young
birds was brought in after the first week. This is placed in a fork, or
between two branches 30 or more feet above the ground. It is a
large domed structure more oblong than round, rather loosely
constructed 18 inches deep, with the opening at one end. The
materials used in every case were dried grass, dead leaves, fibre, and
the curly tendrils of some vine. The whole thing had a very bleached
appearance and many of the dead leaves were skeletonized. All over
the island grow great thickets of a tall reed-like grass 12 or more
feet high which are used by the natives to thatch their houses, and it
is the long narrow leaves of these, torn up, which the birds use. The
fine fibre had also been stripped out and very freely used. This seemed
rather a dangerous material, as a young bird from the first nest had got
some of it tightly twisted round a leg bringing the foot up to the thigh,
and so completely crippled I had to destroy it. In another nest was one
entangled by the wing, which was so badly swollen I thought it would
have to go too, but it eventually got all right and now I can't pick the
bird out, but it was bad for a long time. The nests have no lining
but at the bottom is a loose litter of broken grass and leaves probably
caused by the birds shuffling about. It was always difficult to get the
young ones out without entirely breaking up the nest, for as I have
mentioned before, their feet and claws are very strong, even more
pronounced when young, and with these they hold on to anything they
can grip, so much so that whenever one was picked up it always brought
another with it, either by the head, wing, or leg, and tightly they held
them too. The claws were also used freely for climbing about. The
opening to the nest was usually fouled by droppings which consisted

entirely of fig seeds, dry, and trodden quite liard. No nest contained
more tfian three young ones, and on two occasions only two, but in
both these under the litter was a clear egg pure white, so evidently
three is the complete clutch. When first hatched the bill is flesh colour.
This quickly turns to yellow and before they leave the nest it has
become orange. This looked strikingly beautiful against the dark
blue heads of the first plumage, but would probably not look so well
against the scarlet of the adult stage. The upper mandible quickly
changes to a dingy black, beginning at the tip and spreading upwards,
but the sides of the lower mandible remain more or less yellow for a
long time. The legs and feet at first flesh colour, gradually get darker,
and finally blackish. In all I reared seventeen young ones, but one
caught a chill after it could feed itself, through bathing late in the
evening during the hurricane when the temperature fell very low, and
died the next morning ; and another from the last nest of all jumped
from my hand on the verandah at Vila just as the sudden darkness
of the tropical night came on, and was lost under the house. The
remaining fifteen arrived here safely. They were among the most
delightful youngsters I have ever reared. They all had enormous
appetites, and it was really delightful to see a row of them all with
their orange bills wide open asking for food. At first the iridescent
nodules at the gape were bright blue, but quickly lost their brilliance as
the birds grew. On the palate were two crescent-shaped patches, black,
and very conspicuous when the mouths were open. Long after they
could feed themselves they still liked to be hand fed, and whenever
I opened the cage door they jumped out on my hand and arm with
beaks wide open. I reared them on a mixture of fig seeds (crushed at
first) with the yolk of hard boiled egg and biscuit meal which seemed to
suit them perfectly, and they were as easy to rear as any birds I have
ever had. At first the food was well moistened with water, but later
given fairly dry. When canary seed was supplied they took to it
at once.
In their first plumage they had the head and upper breast very dark
blue shaded into a much lighter greenish blue on the under parts, the
rump dark red and the tail brownish red, the back and wings dirty
green. At the time of writing (May) they are now five and four months

old, and all have red heads, but not quite the bright cherry red of adult
birds. Some, probably the older oues, are quite bright blue on the back
and fore breast. It is not a fact as an American orrithologist states (he
was judging only from skins) that they moult straight from the nest
plumage to the adult, for the first change is nothing like so bright, nor
is the body entirely blue. This can be seen by the pair in the Bird
House at the Zoo. Individual birds seem to vary in some particulars
as we caught birds still showing the blue nodules at the gape, while
some of our hand-reared ones lost them even before they were able to
feed alone, and others again still showed them much later. Also the
bills turned black in some cases much sooner than in others from the
same nest. The hen birds according to the same ornithologist are sup-
posed to have the wings entirely green, while the cock has the wing
coverts the same blue as the body, but we are still uncertain if this is
quite correct.
On 24th January two young ones were brought to me in the nest
which could not have been more than a few hours old. They were so
feeble and tiny, barely an inch long, it seemed impossible to do any-
thing with them. They were entirely flesh coloured, body, bill, and legs,
and opened a minute oblong mouth with the tips of the bill so slightly
developed as to be all but invisible, but the dark crescent marks on the
palate and the blue spots at the gape were highly conspicuous. I did
my best with them and failed, but they lived for four days.
The island we were on was entirely waterless so far as springs
or wells were concerned. The natives depend upon rain water and
the birds likewise. Fortunately the rainfall is heavy, but at times
they suffer from a shortage.
We found the regias extremely difficult to get on to seed. At one
time we thought we might have to bring them home as fruit-eating
Finches. It was no good trying to starve them on to it, we did this for
several hours first thing every morning, neither would they take soaked
seed. For weeks we looked in vain for husks, then after a time a few
grains of canary seed were eaten by a few, but not enough to keep them
alive. At first we gave them their natural figs cut in half, and these they
ate in quantities, but made a dreadful mess of the cages and them-
selves by throwing the outer red part about which stained everything

crimson. Then we started to take the seedy centres out on the
point of a spoon, and mixed it with biscuit and the yolk of hard boiled
egg. Hours and hours were spent every day over this until we loathed
the very sight of the fruits ; moreover the outer part of the " naida "
variety contained an acid which after a time burnt away the skin on
the finger-tips until they bled and became extremely painful. We put
a native on the job, and at first he rather laughed at the effect of the
fruit on us, but after a few days he suffered just the same. We had
thought that his fingers would be harder. The regias were very fond of
egg, and I think this kept them from falling off in condition. We kept
up this egg and biscuit even after they had taken well to seed, so we
landed here without one weak or thin bird. After we had left the islands
and could get apples, we gave them some every day, and greatly they
enjoyed it, and lettuce also.
Unless one has great patience, and is prepared to stay on the islands
until the birds are well on to seed, it would be useless to go there for them.
We were quite afraid to move out of the reach of the figs, not knowing
how the birds would fare when these were suddenly and entirely stopped.
E. trichroa and E. psittacus certainly feed on grass seeds in a wild
state, but I imagine that the species with entirely red heads, such as
pealei, cyanovirens, and serena must feed the same as regia. Perhaps
this is why so few Peale's ever come over, because so few survive until
they are eating seed. The other two have not yet been imported,
but as neither of them is as beautiful as regia, it is hardly worth while
bringing them when you can get the other. Cyanovirens comes from
Samoa, and pealei from Fiji.
There is still one more beautiful species to come, that is, tricolor
from Timor, discovered by Alfred Russell Wallace in 1868. It is a
green bird with the face and the whole of the breast blue. It seems very
desirable, and I have no doubt it is a grass feeder as Timor has much
open grass country. I have landed on the island, but never collected
there.
I mentioned how the New Hebrides are subjected to hurricanes and
that in January it was our ill luck to experience one. For more than
two weeks before we had constant high winds often reaching gale
force and gloomy skies. Later, as the wind grew still stronger, came

torrential rains without ceasing day or night. It seemed impossible to
imagine so much rain, just as if a sea was overhead, so solidly it came
down, and one began to wonder if the sun would ever shine again.
The wind still increased until it reached the peak which lasted more
than a day. The palms bent nearly double, and many snapped in two,
while large branches were falling from other trees all around. Nearly
all leaves were stripped off, and the noise and chaos bewildering.
I was alone at the time, living in a ramshackle iron shanty anything
but watertight at the best of times, and two miles from the nearest
village. Mr. Mayer was away weatherbound on a small island off
the coast unable to return. During the two worst nights I got a native
to come and stay with me as I was afraid if the place went I should be
unable to cope with things single handed. The natives were anxious
for me to remove to the village, but for many reasons it was im-
practicable, as in the first place I doubt if we could have got even the
cages through the storm. Some of the men spent the daylight hours
with me, and with tree trunks and heavy chains strengthened the
place as much as possible, but most of them were occupied in looking
after their own places. Everywhere inside was a foot deep in mud
and water, with bed and everything else wet through. Cooking was
mostly out of the question as fires were hard to keep alight. How
I looked after the birds I don't know, for they were not yet eating
seed, and fruits were impossible to get. Egg and biscuit was about
all they had, and even this under very difficult conditions. I used
to wonder how the birds were faring outside, for it seemed impossible
that any could live through it. A young Zoster op was picked up near
the house, blown from the nest, which I managed to save and rear.
The regias must have suffered, as all the ripe figs were stripped from
the trees and lay rotten on the ground. After the hurricane had died
down I saw many boys pass by with bunches of dead birds they had
picked up. Yet after all this, just a week later, I had the two youngest
regias I have mentioned brought to me, so their nest had escaped,
and the parent birds must have sat through it all and hatched out
the eggs.
These hurricanes must do considerable damage to bird life through-
out the islands. It was days later before we began to hear again the

beautiful notes of the Honey-eaters and tbe screeching of the Lories,
but I thought not so freely as before.
At the same time I was hand-rearing the young regias I also brought
up successfully sixteen Zosterops of two species Z . fiavifrons and
Z. griseinota. Some of these were very newly hatched when brought
in, but all lived, and also four Massena's Lories, Trichoglossus massence.
The Zosterops were reared on that invaluable fruit papayia (called in
some parts pawpaw) and the yolk of hard-boiled egg, while the
Lories, of course, were brought up on the sweet milk mixture.
Now we have introduced the Koyal Parrot Finch over here, it
remains to be seen who will be the first to breed it, and I hope it will
be long before the present stock dies out.
ON BREEDING BLACKBIRDS FOR COLOUR
By Mrs. Florence Verey
Now that the Protection of Birds Act comes into force, many British
bird fanciers will be breeding their own birds. As I have already been
breeding and rearing for several seasons, my experiences may be
useful or interesting.
I have bred Bullfinches for two or three years and have one aviary-
bred cock put up with a wild hen now, and am also hoping to breed
Linnets and Goldfinches; but as there has been lately a most interesting
article on Bullfinches in the Avicultural Magazine, I shall confine
myself to my experience of breeding Blackbirds.
Three years ago Mr. Watts, a well-known local bird-fancier and
veterinary surgeon, found a Blackbird's nest in his hedge with two
strange looking young nearly ready to fly. They were raided by a cat,
but he was fortunately able to rescue one which he presented to me,
and I finished it by hand, using Spratt's C.L.O., sieved flies, chopped
earthworms, and a little egg-yolk now and again.
This bird, a hen. I named Mistletoe. She is a very pale creamy
white cinnamon, or light biscuit colour, with greyish underfluff, pink
eyes, yellow bill, and pink feet and legs.

Mrs. Florence Verey--On Breeding Blackbirds for Colour 183
In her first season, 1932, she was mated to a normal cock which,
although already paired, left his own wife for the blonde beauty.
Three clutches were laid, all infertile. The hen was very fat, her
wing having been injured by the cat, and having insufficient exercise.
I built a large enclosure with natural grass, trees and bushes, where
she wintered into perfect condition, nested early, and hatched four
young, all normal, all reared. In three weeks another nest with six eggs
was completed, all hatched, two died, one being a cinnamon. The other
four had all greyish bars across the tails, one cock having grey barred
flights, and the other a cream feather on the shoulder. Third nest,
three eggs, one broken, two normal birds reared. So that in 1933 this
hen reared ten young, six cocks and four hens, and lost two, one being
a cinnamon.
I am now trying inbreeding to endeavour to fix the cinnamon
strain. The old hen is mated to the young cock with the barred tail
and shoulder mark. She hatched two young from three eggs on Easter
day. One very pale and one dark. The former died at six days and the
other left the nest in stormy weather and died of exposure. At this
time I was most extraordinarily fortunate in being given a nestling of
precisely the same shade as my old hen, and although quite four days
younger than the chick in the nest, I put it under Mistletoe, who did
not resent it, though very surprised, and took charge of the baby, both
cock and hen feeding it most carefully. It was very pleasing to see
how much care they took that the older nestling should have no undue
advantage over the smaller and weaker chick. I left it with them for
four days, and then took it in to finish by hand, when the other
chick died. It is now a very fine well-grown youngster. It was given
to me by a member of our local society, Mr. Drew, who, fortunately
for me, knew how anxious I was for another bird of that colour.
Mistletoe nested again very quickly, building her nest and laying
two eggs within 26 hours from the time I took the cinnamon away.
She laid five in all. Three hatched, one died, one cinnamon and one
normal doing well. At the time of writing they are seven days old.
A very interesting incident occurred which shows the homing instinct
of birds very strongly. I took a pair of ordinary Blackbirds that I had
bred from for experience in 1933, the hen being hand-reared in 1932,

and released them in woodlands some 10 miles away, and a little later
the old cock who had been caged nearly two years was also given his
liberty about 14 miles away. These birds all returned, and I took both
cocks back into the aviary during the bad weather, and then let
them out again. The old cock became such a nuisance trying to find his
way in that I was obliged to put him in a box cage. I then sent him
from here, that is Bournemouth, to Haslemere and released him
there. He came back the same night. The hen is very tame. She is
rearing her second nest at liberty and will allow me to touch her.
To return to my line-breeding : the other 1933 cock from the second
nest has been mated to a light-coloured hen from the same nest. She
hatched two out of four eggs, one, a pale cinnamon, died at four days,
one normal died at about a week. Another pair had a nest of three
eggs set clear and have laid again. The eggs are now due to hatch.
These birds are, of course, kept in separate aviaries, as they fight
desperately.
I make a staple food of Spiller's Saval No. 1 (2 lb.), 1 lb. dried flies,
\ lb. ants' eggs. This food seems to suit any softbill. It can be varied
very greatly. Spratt's C.L.O. food is better than the Saval when
hand-rearing, and for very young birds I usually sieve the flies. I some-
times use milk and sometimes " scrambled " egg. Grated cheese is
much appreciated, but I use it with caution. Fruit, currants, etc.,
are good occasionally. Blackbirds' nests are made of rough grass, roots,
and mud. The hen takes large lumps of mud in her beak, dips it in
water and then pushes it vigorously into the sides and bottom of the
nest, working it smooth with her breast and feet, lining it afterwards
with finer grass.
When she leaves the nest for a few minutes the cock either sits on
the nest himself or stands guard till she returns. They are most
particular over sanitary arrangements, no trace of any offal being
allowed in the neighbourhood of the nest. The parents eat the excreta
for about 12 days and later carry it away.
These inbred birds are very delicate and so far none have been
completely reared. At present the old hen has two, about one week
old, one of them being practically white. If I rear one I shall be
extremely fortunate.

This article, in spite of its title, is neither religious nor philosophical;
it merely attempts to delve further into the question of why birds
die and why they don't !
It is the belief of some students of human disease and also of certain
livestock breeders whose wide experience entitles their opinions to
respect that a &amp;apos;perfectly healthy creature cannot succumb to an attack
by internal parasites or bacteria ; something must have happened to
lower its vitality before these enemies can gain a foothold. That there
is a considerable amount of truth in this theory may be conceded
straight away. Anyone with experience in keeping the larger herbivora
on pasture learns that many animals will become infested with parasitic
worms and soon sicken and die if fed only on hay and grass, but will
remain perfectly healthy and free from parasites it they receive an
ample and well balanced corn ration in addition. Even an inexperienced
beginner in aviculture, moreover, is well aware that certain foreign
birds, when acclimatized, can stand our severest winters, but it would
nevertheless be folly to turn a newly imported example of the same
species into the open during inclement weather.
But the " perfect health " idea, attractive as it is in theory, has
certain limitations in practice, for a bird may have all the recognizable
symptoms of perfect health and yet be in a condition at any moment
to be attacked by fatal illness.
I have already in previous articles called attention to the fact
that, with identical feeding, housing, and general management, birds
of a certain species--sometimes even the same individuals--will do well
in one district and badly in another. It would, indeed, be helpful to
aviculturalists if some kind of geographical chart could gradually be
drawn up showing the districts suitable and unsuitable for different
species, information being derived only from the experience of people
who, if they met with failure in one district, had proved, by their
success in another, that their aviary management was not the cause
of their losses.
Eor the most reliable indications of good health in birds we look to

perfection in the colour and texture of plumage, liveliness, and a readi-
ness to breed at the appropriate (or inappropriate !) season. If the
" perfect health 55 theory were free from snags of any kind, the more
perfect a bird's plumage and the livelier its demeanour, the less liable
that bird should be to sudden attacks of illness. Unfortunately, how-
ever, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that it does not
always work out in this way : by good aviary management you can
get a bird into the most perfect show condition in a bad district for its
species and yet at any moment you may find it fatally ill; and not
only that ; your fellow-aviculturalist living in another district favour-
able to the species may be keeping the same kind of bird and, by reason
of inferior aviary management, his stock may never be a patch on yours
in looks and beauty of plumage, and yet his shabby specimens will
be alive years after the last of yours have gone to a better world--,
which is the most unkindest cut of all, but is nevertheless a fact of
common occurrence ! Lest the reader should think that I may be
unduly prejudiced in favour of my own birds and that a more impartial
observer would not detect inferior condition in the longer-lived
specimens in other collections, I may add that in different districts but
in the same aviaries I have been successful in getting a species of bird
into equally perfect show condition, but in the one place it was always
short-lived and liable to sudden illness and in another gave no trouble
at all.
Occasionally a bird, after years of perfect health in one place, will
start getting ill every time you put it back in the aviary where it has
flourished so long ; yet if sent to another district it may regain its
freedom from illness. Occasionally, too, though much more rarely,
a bird, after a series of illnesses, will enter on a period of immunity in
the very place where it was always going wrong. In all these cases
I am speaking only of acclimatized birds in what appears to be perfect
condition and plumage.
There is an unexplored and probably important field of research
in the direction of finding out whether any system of dieting can
reduce liability to disease. It is said that among domestic poultry
fowls getting an adequate iodine ration are markedly less liable to
disease than those whose diet is deficient in iodine.

The Marquess of Tavistock--Some Problems of Mortality 187
It is interesting to hear the experiences--often profoundly different
from our own--of aviculturalists living in Australia or California.
Birds that we find hardy they often find extremely difficult. I cannot
resist the conclusion that aviculture in such countries is working under
an immense handicap owing to the lack of experienced post mortem
examiners and post mortem work. If such work were undertaken in
competent hands I believe many people would be surprised at the
result--and also greatly helped.
What puzzles me most is the reputation for delicacy in confinement
earned in Australia by such Parrakeets as Crimson-wings and Mealy
Bosellas. There is, I think, a widespread belief that change of diet
is at the root of the trouble. Now when it is a question of accustoming
a bird whose natural diet is live insects, or even a particular kind of
nectar, to a totally different artificial food, I can understand that there
may be a probability of serious digestive disturbances, but frankly
I cannot believe that a seed and fruit-eating Parrakeet which in this
country need never suffer from digestive trouble can in Australia,
perish wholesale when put on a diet on wdiich in this country it can
rear its young successfully and (if given the right nest) invariably,
from the tenderest age. Of course, one can imagine a wild bird being
too terrified to feed at all in confinement and dying of sheer starvation,
and for this reason I can understand the deaths from paralysis of
newly-caught Barrabands, for the most acclimatized of Barrabands is
liable to paralysis if it starts to feed voraciously after a period of starva-
tion due to any cause other than illness. I have had cases of paralysis,
in Barrabands that strayed when at liberty and were returned half-
starved, and paralysis has occurred a few days after arrival in young
Barrabands bred by me and sent to American aviculturalists, it being
the custom of American railway attendants to neglect to feed the birds
entrusted to their care for long journeys. But the curious thing is
that the mortality complained of does not usually occur among birds
that are refusing food, and, although I write in great ignorance of
local conditions, it will take a lot to convince me that these mysterious
deaths are due to anything more than germ infection due to lack of
proper care and cleanliness in the trappers 5 outfit. Transport is
probably a matter of difficulty, and I can imagine the birds being

crammed into small and overcrowded boxes with no proper cleaning
of floors or perches. Perhaps the same boxes may be used for trip
after trip to avoid the bother of making new ones. In a hot climate
a few hours in an insanitary and infected box is enough to seal the fate
of any susceptible Parrakeet, and as the period of incubation of the
disease varies, it is perfectly easy to buy birds that look perfectly
healthy and yet find them drop off one by one a few days later. An
inexperienced person, or one who cannot ascertain the exact cause of
death, will attribute his losses to change of diet or to the bird's natural
delicacy or cussedness, but if you have had experience--as I did in
pre-war days--of a real good septic fever outbreak due to the primitive
sanitation of dealers' shops and travelling cages, you will know in what
direction to look for the true cause of your troubles !

Mr. Rogers sent me this pair of Doves early in March from an
importation just received. According to Mr. Newman in Aviculture ,
there appear to be more than one race of this Dove, and I have no
means of knowing exactly where mine came from, but the description
he gives seems to fit my birds. They are greyish-brown with purple
reflections on the neck and a dash of mauve on the breast. And they
have a black spot behind the eye and on the wing coverts, and a
graduated tail, the centre feathers rather pointed at the end. My
pair were rather rough in plumage on arrival but very quickly improved
in a warm flight. There were no nest boxes indoors, but the very
first day they were let outdoors they started to explore an open-
sided box filled with bracken, and quickly built a small nest of twigs
in it.
So far as we know only one egg was laid, certainly only one was
incubated, but I am sure the normal clutch must be two. I cannot
state the period of incubation, but a well-grown and feathered young

one left the nest on May 11th, and seemed surprisingly steady and
sensible. This species is recorded by Dr. Hopkinson as having been

THE BLACK MAMBA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99790584" page_id="56219736"  page_num="190" year="" vol="">
I must congratulate Mr. Moore for producing two " Black Mambas
These are very nearly mouse grey. It should have been obvious to any one
reading my notes in the January issue that I did not doubt the existence of
a dark-coloured Mamba and that I was merely having a " dig " at the many
people who circulate untrue or grossly exaggerated stories concerning Mambas.
The habits described by Mr. Moore of the " Black " Mamba when attacked
by dogs applies equally to large green Mambas. The Mambas in the Zoo
became very subdued shortly after being liberated, in the same way that
green ones do. As far as I know the venom of the dark variety has never
been proved to be more potent than that of the green.
Concerning animal myths and legends in general, Mr. Moore in a previous
letter suggests that there is usually something in them, and cites the case
of the Okapi. The fact that this animal was discovered in 1900 ? in a practic-
ally unexplored region is no justification for supposing that there are monsters
and other queer animals in existence to-day in comparatively settled areas.
A naturalist at heart likes to record things as he sees them, and not be
guided by hearsay. To the general public, animal " stories " are greatly
appreciated, and they provide the popular Press with excellent copy, and
in some cases they are even good for trade as many people living near Loch
Ness are aware, but that is no reason why I should believe in them.

two chicks in the Western Aviary, which are doing well. These birds first
nested early in the year, selecting a bare piece of ground in the outside run,
scraping but a slight hollow into which was drawn a few pieces of grass.
The first clutch of four pyriform olive-grey brown-spotted eggs was damaged
by frost, but a second clutch was more successful. The chicks, which could
run almost as soon as hatched, are beautiful little things, as all young plovers
are, with fluffy black and brown spotted down, and a very conspicuous buff
collar on the nape.
The experiment of liberating a number of Indian Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus
coromandus) from the Zoological Gardens has provided the interesting sight
of the flight of these small white herons. They are fond of flying in parties

of six or eight over the wide spaces of Regent's Park, and settling on the
grass or on the trees near the lake, returning regularly to the neighbourhood
of the Eastern Aviary or Three-island pond for food. In the evenings they
visit the Sea Lions' pond for any scraps of fish, and the flies attracted thereby,
and they have been accused of poaching lizards from the reptiliary.
Night Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) have bred this year for the third
year in succession in the Great Aviary. There are three nests and already
three young birds have been successfully reared from one of these. The sites
selected have been the large clumps of ivy growing on the central supports.
A specimen of the Pygmy Hermit Humming Bird (Phaethornis pygmseas)
was recently exhibited in a separate case in the Tropical House. It is one
of the very smallest species, and apparently difficult to keep for any length
of time. This one survived for five weeks only, and the body was carefully
weighed, turning the scales at 1 gram 400 milligrams, or the exact weight of
a threepenny piece.

MAGELLAN GOOSE ALLOWS HER EGGS TO COOL

There are so many things relating to bird culture which I'm afraid you
Europeans take as a matter of course and therefore do not mention, but
which would be most instructive to us Americans, so much younger at
bird-raising than you, that I venture to write regarding an experience of
mine which seemed rather unusual, and to ask whether any readers of
your Magazine have noted a similar procedure.
A few days since on inspecting the eggs of a Magellan Goose, I noted
that the shells were just pipped. This was early in the morning while the
weather was still cool and damp. The day turned off very hot indeed, and
a few hours later I saw the goose walking about with the gander, and she
continued to stay with him, away from the nest. This seemed foreign to
my usual experience with the variety, as the goose has usually sat most
closely while the eggs were hatching. On investigation, I found that the
goose had covered the eggs beautifully with her nest down, but had left
several small openings, apparently by intent. I infer that, because of the
great heat of the day, the goose decided (if geese do decide) that the eggs
would be better off with a light covering allowing a little air. At any rate,
all the eggs have hatched into strong robust goslings, so the treatment must
have been effective. I forgot to say that the goose stayed off all day, but
sat closely the same evening and through the night, bringing the goslings
off about noon the following day.
I have not happened to observe this particular behaviour before, and
wonder whether it is usual under like circumstances.
We find it necessary to yard our Magellans away from other geese, as
they are extremely vicious, not being excelled in this respect by such
varieties as the Spur-winged, Egyptian, Cereopsis, etc. I wonder if any
of your readers have some method whereby Magellans and other uncertain
tempered varieties can be safely kept in a mixed collection. One must be

philosophical about losses in bird breeding, for there are certain to be at
least a few, even under the very best of conditions and care, but preventable
losses should not be tolerated and killings by vicious varieties surely come
under that head.

[It is not unusual for waterfowl to leave their eggs for hours, especially
in warm weather, just before hatching. The safest time to send eggs of
Ducks and Geese, intended for hatching, seems to be when they are nearly
due to hatch. Then, if wrapped in several layers of cotton-wool, they can
safely be sent on a journey of some hours, with the certainty of their hatching
successfully. The length of time that they are allowed to cool should not
exceed say ten or twelve hours, and the weather should not be too cold.
Magellan Geese are noted for their pugnacity, especially when
breeding.--E d.]

The following letter, which hails from Romford, Essex, was written
to the Zoological Society :--
I am the owner, of two Macaws, one from Granada, which is light blue in
colour with golden breast, the other one from Venezuela. One of these
birds has recently started to lay eggs, two lots of these eggs contained dead
chicks. On the hen-bird's last lay a young Macaw was hatched and is
progressing well, it is&amp;apos; now over five weeks old. I understand that this is
extremely rare, and would esteem it a great favour if you would be so kind
as to enlighten me on this point. The two birds are in no way captive,
having complete freedom of a large garden, also the house ; they are fed on
any old scraps. They have a nest of shavings and sawdust in an old coal-
shed outside in the garden.

THE REV. KINGSFORD VENNER'S " NOTES A CORRECTION
My bad writing was probably responsible for several mistakes in the
article you were good enough to publish in the last number of the Magazine,
the only important one being at the end, where I am made to say that
I consider Whydahs and Combassous " the best livers " of all small foreigners.
I never said any such thing. I consider most of these birds, especially
" paradisea " and even Combassous, anything but long lived. The bird
I did refer to was the Orange Bishop, and this grand little species, for cheap-
ness, longevity and general hardiness, stands alone, and when in colour is
always a delight. I believe I had my present cock in 1928, and he is just
assuming his wonderful flame-like suit of velvet for the umpteenth time.

BRUSH-TURKEYS
The Mound-builders of Australia and islands in the vicinity are
some of the most interesting of birds, especially as regards their
breeding habits, which have frequently been described. The species
best known is the Brush-turkey (Catheturus lathami) of Queensland
and New South Wales, which not only thrives in this country, but
breeds under suitable conditions. On several occasions, in the
London Zoological Gardens, young have been successfully reared,
but at Whipsnade the conditions are more natural and success
should be more certain. A pair kept there in the Wood Lawn Bird
Sanctuary have already produced young this year, so a short account
of their behaviour may be of interest. As is well-known, the cock
bird alone constructs the mound, which he forms by scratching
leaves, grass, and sticks from a considerable area to his chosen site,
which is always in the partial shade of some tree or bush. He
commences early in the spring and continues working during the
daylight hours all the spring and early summer. Commencing at
some distance from his mound, he continues to throw the material
backwards with his powerful feet, until by degrees a large pile
is formed. It has been stated that several hens deposit their eggs
in the one mound, but from our experience I should say that this
is a mistake. However large the enclosure, it is useless to attempt

to keep more than one pair of Brush-turkeys. If there are two or
three hens the cock will select one as his mate and kill the others.
The mound being ready, the hen will climb to the top, scratch out
a hole and deposit one large white egg, which she will quickly
proceed to cover up, taking care that it rests in an upright position,
the large end at the top. The cock will then drive her off and finish
the covering process. A day or two later she will deposit another
egg in the same way, and continue until perhaps fifteen or twenty
have been safely placed in the mound. The cock bird continues to
guard and add to the mound throughout the summer months,
driving off all intruders in the form of large birds or mammals.
If the day is likely to be hot he will open up the top to prevent
the temperature becoming too high, but if the weather&amp;apos; is cold he
continues to pile on additional material. In five or six weeks,
providing all is. well, chicks will begin to emerge, and there is little
doubt that the cock, by removing some of the material of the
mound, helps them to escape from, the natural incubator. When
they emerge, the chicks are clothed with thick down over their
bodies, but their wings are well developed, as they need to be, for
they have to fend entirely for themselves. They are driven away
from the mound to lead their own lives and find their own living.
The mound used last year by the Whipsnade birds was removed
in the winter, and the material weighed. There were five tons of
good leaf-mould.

NESTING NOTES ON BRONZE-WING PIGEONS

The first pair of these beautiful birds I placed in a rather
spacious aviary in May of last year. Since they were exceptionally
tame, it was a delight to feed and otherwise care for them. More-
over, they lived peacefully with Greenwings, Diamond, and other
kinds of doves.
It was not until this year, however, that the Bronze-wing

Carl N'aether--Nesting Notes on Bronze-wing Pigeons 195
Pigeons showed any inclination to mate. On 10th January I observed
the male in his typical love pose : lowering his head and spreading
his wings to disclose to a rather unconcerned female his featherly
irridescence. Three days later, the birds began to build a nest with
small twigs in a large hanging basket. It was a simple but
substantial affair, this first nest. About this time the male Bronze-
wing became quite pugnacious, chasing the other occupants of the
aviary, including his mate, from corner to corner. Occasionally
the female would sit on the nest for short periods of time, but it
was not until four days later that she laid her first and rather
pointed egg, which she refused to incubate. Often after midnight
I heard plainly the low and rather plaintive call of the male,
followed at short intervals by his mate's " grunts
Seemingly displeased with their initial effort at home-making,
the Bronze-wings left the first nest exactly four days after the
first and only egg was deposited--in order to build afresh. In
a secluded, half-dark corner of the aviary they found a suitable
box at an approximate height of three and a half feet. On
29th January the hen laid one egg and again refused to sit on it.
On 4th February the birds proceeded to build their third nest, in
which, again, but one egg was laid, but this time the birds brooded
for three days, the cock during the day and the hen during the
night. Being very tame and very friendly, the birds hardly took
any notice of me when I entered their abode, except occasionally
to ask for a bit of hempseed of which they seem extraordinarily
fond. This time two eggs were laid, but Mrs. Bronze-wing showed
no desire whatever to incubate them. During all these weeks the
male was still sounding his low mating note. I placed the eggs
in the nest of some other doves, but they were both not fertile.
A dealer informed me that this infertility was undoubtedly caused
by the birds being a nest-pair, of which assumption, however, I
had no proof whatever. However, the breeder from whom the pair
was purchased, assured me that infertile eggs were by no means
rare among Bronze-wing and&amp;apos; other foreign pigeons, especially
among young pairs, and that I might confidently expect fertile eggs
later on--a prediction which in this case came true.

Thinking that the birds would do better if placed by themselves,
I transferred them to a small pen on 16th February. Here they
started nesting the following day and soon the hen laid her fourth
setting of eggs. Still she would not sit on them. Not until the
fifth setting of eggs was deposited---on 18th March--did the birds
incubate. On 2nd April, one young was hatched, the other egg
containing a chick improperly developed. For twelve days the
old birds sat tightly on the nest, taking excellent care of their
only youngster. Then they began to seek another nesting site. I
placed the half-starved youngster under a pair of pigeons which
fed him pigeon milk so that he soon recovered, gaining strength
and growing noticeably every day. On the fourth day, however,
I found him dead in the nest, his well-feathered little body still
warm and his crop well-filled. The man who had assured me
that the infertility of the Bronze-wings' eggs was due to their
being a nest pair, now informed me that the same trouble-
in breeding--was responsible for the death of the young bird, no
doubt, a weakling.
Late in May the birds built again--this time an elaborate nest
--well-rounded and solid. Both eggs that were soon laid, hatched,
though one young died soon afterwards. Faithfully, the old birds
have been hovering over their young now for slightly more than
two weeks. Yesterday (14th June) morning I found the young
Bronze-wing, well-feathered and almost full-grown, on the ground
begging his parents for food. They, however, instead of paying
attention to their hungry offspring, were calling to each other
devotedly. After placing the young bird whose crop was empty
back into the nest, I separated the parents in the hope of seeing
their youngster fed until he is able to feed himself. If need be,
I shall hand-feed the young fellow rather than risk losing him
at his age.
The behaviour of the Bronze-wing Pigeons described in the
foregoing paragraphs is, I have observed, more or less typical
of many other kinds of doves. Thus far, only the African
Triangular-spotted Pigeons, the Rufous-wing, and the Diamond
Doves have reared their young successfully to maturity. If any

reader of this sketch has evolved an especially successful method
of handfeeding delicate young doves or of otherwise preventing
the starvation of half-grown young, I should be glad to receive
his suggestions as to methods, and kinds of feed employed. It is
interesting to observe the enthusiasm with which dealers and
breeders in this country assure prospective purchasers that doves
will breed freely, never even alluding to their habitual tendency
to let their young starve.

Almost the whole of the entire surface from the water's edge
to the tops of the highest mountains in the centre of the island
is upholstered with a covering of the densest virgin forest in all
its primeval glory. Giant ferns and mosses reach perfection
under the shade of the forest giants and one's feet sink down in
the soft damp humus of untold centuries. The whole island is
indented with vast bays and inlets reaching many miles into the
island and resembling great inland lakes. One threads one's way
in a yacht or launch through a maze of forest-covered islands,
each one a jew^el of sub-tropical scenery, through narrow sounds
and creeks over still translucent green waters to the heads of the
amazingly beautiful fjords. All around are gradually sloping
mountains clothed from the water's edge to the topmost summits
with the luxuriant forest. Hardly a vestige of rock or earth is
visible, for here Nature seems modest of showing her gaunt
nakedness.
One is awed by the deep still peace which has reigned
over these calm waters since the very beginning of time. Here
Penguins, Cormorants, Gulls, and seals fish and desport themselves
in the tranquil waters undisturbed and unafraid of man. The

a
dense almost tropical vegetation shelters many of New Zealand's
rarest birds, the great Grey Kiwis, the Wattled Crows, Robins,
Fernbirds, and many others which are now almost extinct on the
mainland.
Many were the dark and sinister deeds perpetrated by the early
sealers and the crews of the old whaling vessels in these quiet
waters--but that is another story unfitted for the pages of this
Magazine.
Although to the casual observer conditions appear to be the
same as they were aeons ago, sinister enemies have crept into
this sylvan paradise. Rats, cats, etc., introduced many years ago
by the crews from the whaling vessels, have fattened and thrived
on the feathered prey which they found so plentiful. They have
multiplied to an alarming extent and take a very heavy toll of the
bird life. This in time will lead to the extermination of certain
species such as the South Island Robin, the Wattled Crows, and
the South Island Thrush. Introduced deer of several species have
done a great deal of damage in destroying the undergrowth.
To get back to the Cormorants, these birds are very conspicuous
with their black and white plumage, sitting on the nests with their
mates resting beside them. The large nests of sticks, whitened
by the droppings of the birds, are built between the forks of the
rather sparse branches which the birds have cleared of all foliage.
I often wondered how the birds managed to get the first sticks to
lie in place. This feat must require a considerable amount of
patience and ingenuity on the part of the birds. There is none of
the dirt or smell usually associated with Cormorant rookeries when
built on the rocks, for the nests being built over the waters, all the
droppings and debris are washed away.
All species are exceptionally tame and one can approach
within a few feet of the sitting birds. Unfortunately for the birds,
nearly all the New Zealand Cormorants are very confiding, and
this has been their undoing, for all species are ruthlessly
slaughtered around the coasts of New Zealand by the colonists
who state that they feed upon large quantities of fish and who
want but the slightest excuse for slaying any bird. Before the

coming of the colonists, when the birds were extremely numerous,
the seas were teeming with all manner of fish.
People go out in launches, catch fish by the hundred, a great
many of them quite inedible, let them die on the bottom of the boat,
then throw them back into the water, yet the same people will
grudge the Cormorants taking a paltry few for their sustenance.
I saw many species of Cormorants, but the most beautiful of
all and possibly the most lovely of all the known Cormorants is
the Spotted Shag (Stictocarbo punctatus), a species once common
around the shores of New Zealand, but alas, now comparatively
rare, being only found on a few secluded islands. Shortly after
I landed in New Zealand I was taken with a small party in a launch
to one of the few breeding places of the birds, a single islet in
the Hauraki Gulf. There was a small breeding colony in a cave,
the nests being made on the sloping sides of rock. The young
were almost full grown. In all there must have been about twenty
to thirty birds counting the young ones. Unfortunately many of
the adults had been maimed by the thoughtless wretches who
meander round the islands in the Gulf shooting at every sea bird.
Some had broken wings and others hanging legs. The birds are
very tame and had we have liked, we could have wiped out the
entire colony. We got within a few feet of the birds, which escaped
by diving through a hole at the end of the cave and coming out
into the open sea. This species is very sedentary, seldom
wandering very far from the spot where it first saw the light of
day; in fact its powers of flight are feeble at the best. At the
present rate it will not be long before this beautiful bird is
exterminated, for once a bird comes in competition with man and
his food supply, it stands no earthly chance, for then he has an
excuse to persecute it with the utmost vigour.
A description of the plumage would be too complicated and
would give no idea of the great beauty of the birds, as it differs
entirely from the ordinary Cormorants. It is much smaller than
the usual Cormorants, and has a slender beak; the head is
adorned with two crests, one on the front of the head and the
other on the nape, and in the breeding season white filomentous
plumes grow from various parts of the plumage.

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
I was fortunate in seeing, in the waters around Stewart Island,
the equally beautiful Blue Shag (S. steadi) a bird which was
almost exterminated years ago but has since gained ground.
The Yellow-breasted Tit (Petroica macrocephala)
This charming species is the Southern representative of the
White-breasted Tit, and is much more beautiful than the Northern
species, having the whole of the breast a delicate sulphur yellow.
It seems to me even more friendly than the white-breasted species
and can always be found where there are extensive patches of
native forest.
I first made the acquaintance of this bird at Mount Cook, many
thousands of feet above sea-level. It must be very hardy to
withstand the rigours of the very severe winters for it can hardly
migrate to lower levels as the only other forest patches which
have been left unburnt are either on high snow-capped peaks or
many hundreds of miles further south.
It is a strange thing that nearly all the New Zealand birds
belong to families found mainly in the tropics and yet the New
Zealand representatives are oftimes found where weather
conditions, especially in the winter, are extremely severe. But
there is little doubt that the birds feed to a great extent on insects
which are in a state of torpor and which lie hidden during the
winter months in rolled-up leaves, behind the bark of trees, and
in any small crevices in the trees.
The genus Petroica to which this bird and its congener belong
is much more closely allied to the New Zealand Robins than to
the true tits, in fact these so-called tits very closely resemble
the Robins in demeanour except that they are more arboreal.
They are tame and friendly, and one has only to imitate their
note and in a few minutes a couple are sure to come to within
a few feet. The male is always more in evidence than his sombrely
coloured mate. After he has paused to satisfy his curiosity he
passes on, diligently searching every nook and cranny for small
insects upon which this species entirely feed. This bird has never

to my knowledge been kept in captivity but it would doubtless
make a delightful pet and be much easier to feed than the ordinary
tits. However, there is not the slightest chance of this bird ever
being kept in its native country or exported which is really not
to be regretted when one thinks how very rare nearly all New
Zealand birds are.
The Yellowhead (Mohoua ochrocephala)
This very beautiful and striking-looking bird is found only in
the large forest patches in the South Island where it goes under
the name of " Bush Canary ". It is not common and one may
consider oneself lucky to come across a party of these active and
very inquisitive birds. Like their cousins from the North Island,
the Whiteheads, a party will, upon seeing a stranger, at once
come round and make an examination, but they do not stay for
long, soon passing on through the undergrowth of the forest,
searching in a very business-like way for small insects amongst
the leaves and clusters of berries. Few birds are more genuinely
gregarious than the Whiteheads and Yellowheads. They keep up
a continual twitter as they pass along, and this is increased when
they see a stranger. One can almost imagine their saying, " Oh,
yes, pleased to see you and all that but sorry that we can't stop."
No birds struck me as being so systematic as these two species as
they hunt for their food through the forest. It is a beautiful
sight to see a flock of these brilliant yellow birds passing through
the forest, every now and then giving vent to their exceedingly
sweet and musical song and adopting every possible attitude in
their search for food. I have often noticed Zosterops in associa-
tion with these birds working in closely united flocks.
There is something finch-like in the build of these birds, but
like most of New Zealand's birds, they form a very distinct genus
and have no near affinities. I can never understand why, in the
olden days when they were plentiful, they were never exported to
this country or even kept in their own country, but the chance is
now lost for ever.

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
The Black Fantail (Rhipidura fuliginosa)
It is a strange thing that most species of New Zealand birds
have two forms, one inhabiting the North Island and the other
the South Island. Often the South Island species is the brighter
of the two as is the case of the two preceding species, but it is
not so in this case for this strange gnome-like little bird appears
to be a uniform black from a distance.
I wish that I could convey to the reader, the strange and
rather eerie impression one gets of these dusky, fairy-like little
creatures as they, I was going to say, fly, through the forest, but
they do not appear to do that. They seem to float noiselessly about
in the gloom of the forests like some strange wraith. They are
not a bit bird-like and seem to be the goblins and fairies of one's
childhood days, at last come to life. Their aerial evolutions are
always most fascinating to watch; their movements are quite
effortless. They seem like some huge piece of down blown here
and there by every eddying breath of wind, twisting, turning,
falling and rising with a grace and airiness unknown to any
other bird, the large fan-like tail opening and shutting all the
while. It seems as though the force of gravity had no effect on
the Fantail.
Never for a second still, most of the Fantail's life is spent
in the air in pursuit of minute insects, often invisible to the
naked eye. One always knows when he has had a catch by the
faint click of the tiny beak as it closes on its prey.
I did not find the Black Fantail nearly as numerous as the
Pied. It consorts with its more strikingly coloured relation and
is said to interbreed with it, the young being either pied or black,
there being no intermediate type. It is also stated that a pair
of Black Fantaiis will have pied offspring, which rather goes to
prove that the black species is merely rather a common " sport "
or mutant of the pied bird.
The Fantaiis appear to be all feathers. I never handled one,
but I believe the body is very minute, much smaller than that of
the Gold-crested Wren. Even the trim little Zosterops appear
large when compared to these delicate little mites. Like many

other things in Nature the Fantails must be seen to be appreciated,
for the written word can never convey to the mind the delicate
charm of many a wonderful tropical flower, fish, or bird.
The New Zealand Harrier (Circus approximans)
This fine hawk is the butt of every so-called " sportsman
Every man's hand is against the Harrier, not because of any
depredations it commits in the poultry yard but just because it
is a hawk, and one day, who knows? it might begin to eat the
sheep like the Kea, so say the farmers, and it is always best to
be on the safe side, and it is a hawk anyhow, and should be
killed. But like the English Jay, the relentless persecution has
sharpened its wits and it is holding its own. In fact in the plain
and tussock country in the South Island it is common, and in a
day's travel one sees a great many birds. They are tame and
confiding if one has no guns and will hardly bother to move off
the roadway when one passes in a car.
This bird feeds mainly, as far as I could see, on carrion,
especially on dead rabbits which had been squashed by motors on
the roads. Sometimes it feeds on dead sheep and lambs but it no
doubt supplements this diet with insects and small weakly birds
and mammals. It lacks the strength and swiftness of the other
New Zealand hawk and would stand very little chance of catching
any swift-winged bird.
The Harrier is doubtless a settler from the shores of Australia
for it is quite unsuited to life in the forests with which New
Zealand was once covered. Now with the destruction of the
forests and the introduction of mammals it is far more at home
and has no doubt greatly increased.
Lacking the swift dashing flight of the Falcon, it flies with
slow and steady wing beats and is not lacking in grace when once
it gets properly on the wing, though the usual " throw off " is
very laboured.
These hawks periodically visit the outlying islands of New
Zealand but they do little damage where the islands are covered

with forest as they cannot fly through the " bush " owing to the
great wing span. But on the islands which are not forested the
birds play havoc with the young Petrels and Gulls, and, in fact,
any young shore birds. We often used to watch four young
Red-billed Gulls on Little Barrier Island. They were delightful
creatures; they seemed lonely and rather pathetic. They were
quite tame and seemed to know us. Once after an absence of
several days we missed them and later came across their remains.
I rather think a Harrier was the perpetrator of the deed. But
he had no doubt only killed them for food, for hawks do not use
sentiment, but we humans who kill birds for the pleasure of the
thing would rather think of the Harrier killing and feeding upon
rats and the like.
The Harriers differ a great deal in plumage, some being
almost black while others are a very pale grey. This I think is
merely a question of age, the darker birds being the youngest.
In the last ten years the New Zealand Acclimatization Society
have paid a subsidy on the heads of 149,000 hawks and many
thousands of others must have been trapped and shot by farmers,
of which there is no record. No species can possibly keep up with
slaughter for any length of time. It is a strange thing in life
how people will try to discover any bad trait in the character of
any animal and at once make it an excuse for ceaseless persecution.
How few people go out with the avowed object of finding the
good characteristics or attributes in an animal's life with the
object of saving it.
The New Zealand Falcon (Falco novaeseelandiae)
I saw very little of this beautiful little hawk in a state of
freedom for it is now exceedingly scarce and only found in the
few large forest reserves. Utterly fearless, it preys upon all
manner of birds, even ones which are twice its own bulk, especially
poultry, pigeons, etc.; hence it is the anathema of all farmers
and poultry keepers who. have killed it at every opportunity and
very greatly reduced its ranks. Owing to the smallness of the

wings and the swiftness of the flight this bird moves with ease
through the dense forests.
I managed to secure a fine adult bird of this species and I was
struck by the large and beautiful eyes. It proved quite an
intelligent pet and stood the long journey home quite well. It
is now in the Zoological Gardens where I hope it will live many
years. While in my possession the bird fed mainly on sparrows;
mice and minced meat it would eat upon occasion but never unless
it was very hungry. This bird had a very loud cry, something
like the scream of a parrot, which it usually gave vent to when
hungry or excited.
The Kakapo or Owl Parrot (Strigops habroptilus)
This is one of the few endemic birds which I did not see,
though it was the one which I desired to see most of all. Had
I not been laid up for some weeks with a poisoned leg I should
have been able to have got into the " Sounds " district and
doubtless to Resolution Island where the bird is still said to be
found.
There is little doubt unfortunately that this bird, the largest
and most unique of all parrots is on the highroad to total
extinction. Ever since its discovery in 1843 the Kakapo has
been the object of ceaseless persecution on the part of collectors,
in fact so flooded has the market been with the skins of this bird
that the price quoted in a recent catalogue of bird skins was
only 7s. 6d. Nearly every museum in New Zealand possesses
dozens of skins, a large percentage of the population in the South
Island possess at least one stuffed specimen, I even heard of a
person who, when the Kakapo was fairly plentiful, fed them to
his dogs for meat! Prospectors, roadmen, and hunters were
responsible for the slaughter of thousands for food. When at
last the bird was protected, stoats, weasels, and cats helped to
finish the work of destruction. Now this strange parrot has
disappeared from all the districts where it was once plentiful.
In the North Island, where it was numerous in the heavily forested
mountain districts, it is practically gone, no single specimen being

heard of for many years. In the Sounds district, its last stronghold,
it has been reduced to a mere remnant owing to the agency of
the introduced carnivorous mammals. The only hope now lies in
Resolution Island, where once this bird was common. This island
is a sanctuary, but there is no caretaker, and it is not known
whether there are weasels or rats on it. I was hoping to visit this
island but was unable to afford the necessary time. It seems that
no one has been there for many years so that nothing whatever
is known about the bird population. Many years ago there was a
caretaker there who was commissioned by the Government to
capture a limited number of the parrots for the other island
sanctuaries. Four birds were liberated on the Little Barrier
Island but have not been heard of since. There is little doubt
that instead of being liberated in the damp rain forest near the
summit, they were set at liberty in the dry manuka forest near
the coast where they would speedily die out.
Four more were transferred to Kapiti Island where they do
not seem to have increased. Two of these have been seen within
recent years, one a very old one and practically blind but which
Mr. Wilkinson told me was very fat and in excellent condition.
Otherwise there is no trace of them having increased.
In the South Island very few have been seen within recent
years. I have questioned many people but they all tell the same tale,
that where the Kakapo was once common it is hardly ever seen.
This strange bird is larger in bulk than most other parrots,
equalling in size a large Macaw, though with having a com-
paratively short tail it does not equal them in length. It is of a
beautiful light moss green, each feather being mottled wdth black
and yellow. There are facial discs like those of an owl. The feet
are large and heavy, eminently suitable for the terrestrial existence
which it leads. The whole of its habits are the absolute
antithesis of those of the ordinary run of parrots. It is nocturnal
and feeds mainly upon mosses, buds, leaves, and berries of the
forest shrubs. During the day, it hides in the hollow roots of
Some forest tree or in a cavity of a fallen log. After dusk has
fallen it sets out in search of its food.

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds 207
Quite wide tracks are made from the sleeping holes to the
feeding grounds and old pioneers have told me how surprised they
have been at the very large foot-prints made by the birds in the
soft earth. With long disuse the muscles of the wings have
atrophied and the bird is no longer able to fly. Flight of course
was not necessary to this bird, for nearly all its food was obtained
from the ground and it had no enemies to contend with. Few
birds are stranger or more highly specialized than the Kakapo.
Outwardly it bears a resemblance to the owls; it possesses well
defined facial discs, it has the soft downy plumage of the owls, and
it is one of the very few parrots which are strictly nocturnal. It
is said that this bird is a connecting link between the owls and the
parrots but this is impossible. The Kakapo has, owing to its
nocturnal habits, doubtless taken on some of the superficial
characteristics of the owls, otherwise it bears no resemblance to
them anatomically.
These birds feed mainly on the mosses which are so plentiful
in the New Zealand forests, and for this purpose it was supplied
with an exceedingly large crop. Old writers have stated that
when this was full the birds were almost unable to move.
In the days of the Maori Wars, between 1850 and 1860, when
bands of British soldiers were meandering through most of the
forested parts of the North Island killing Maoris and destroying
their villages there is little doubt that the bird life must have
suffered considerably, especially such large birds as the Kakapos,
etc. When the country in the South Island was opened up, the
slaughter was terrible, the birds forming the chief article of food
for the prospectors and saw millers. Dogs also played great havoc
with these birds as they were very easy to track down to their
burrows during the day. Being unfit to combat any type of enemy
and being very slow breeders (it is said that only one egg is laid
every other year) it is easy to understand how the numbers of
this bird so quickly diminished.
In the old days the Kakapo was frequently kept in captivity
and was occasionally exported to various European Zoos. By
all accounts it proved an exceedingly interesting and intelligent
pet, especially for a nocturnal bird. It fed largely on various

fruits, roots, buds, and green vegetables. There is but the very
remotest chance that the bird will ever be seen in this country
again. No stone should be left unturned in using every possible
endeavour to preserve this most unique of all the world's birds.
If any reader wishes to read the life history of this strange bird
I would refer him to Buller, Birds of New Zealand , in which
is a very lengthy chapter dealing with the habits of this bird.
The North Island Thrush (Turnagra tanagra)
Of New Zealand's two endemic thrushes, one of these, the North
Island species, commenced to disappear very soon after the
colonization of the country by the white races and a matter of
only forty years after it had been made known to science it was
reckoned as extinct, the last specimens being obtained in 1900.
Since that date it has never been heard of. I have good reason
to think that I saw an example of this supposedly extinct bird.
It was also seen by another member of our party who verified my
statement. I saw the bird twice, both times flying up a hillside.
I recognized it at once by being totally different from the introduced
thrush, a much bigger bird, a different coloured back, chestnut
tail, and thick, heavy beak, but owing to only seeing the bird from
above I was unable to see the chief distinguishing feature, the
white throat, but I have no doubt in my own mind that it was the
bird in question.
Like many of the other New Zealand birds which are called by
familiar names, these birds are not thrushes in the true sense of
the word, being very distinct and belong to a family confined
entirely to New Zealand.
The total disappearance of this fine bird is rather a mystery,
but I dare say forest fires, introduced carnivorous mammals, and
the inevitable pot hunter did much to hasten its departure from
this plane. Sir Walter Buller was perhaps the only person ever to
keep this species in captivity and his account is so interesting
that I have no hesitation in quoting it in full. He says of this
bird : "It was when I obtained a caged Piopio that I first became
acquainted with its superior vocal powers. In 1866 I purchased

one for a guinea from a settler in Wellington, in whose possession
it had been for a whole year. Although an adult bird when taken,
it appeared to have become perfectly reconciled to confinement;
b.ut on being placed in a new cage it made strenuous assaults on
the wire bars, and persevered until the feathers surrounding its
beak were rubbed off and a raw wound exposed. It then desisted
for several days; but when the abraded part had fairly healed,
it renewed the attempt, and with such determined effort that the
fore part of the head was completely disfigured and the life of th(c)
bird endangered. On being removed, however, to a spacious
compartment of the aviary, it immediately became reconciled to
its condition, made no further effort to escape, and for a period
of fifteen months (when it came to an untimely end) it continued
to exhibit th(c) contentment and sprightliness of a bird in the state
of nature.
" I observed that this bird was always most lively during or
immediately preceding a shower of rain. He often astonished
me with the power and variety of his notes. Commencing sometimes
with the loud strains of the Thrush, he would suddenly change
his song to a low flute-note of exquisite sweetness; and then
abruptly stopping would give vent to a loud rasping cry, as if
mimicking a pair of Australian Magpies confined in the same
aviary. During the early morning he emitted at intervals a short
flute-note and when alarmed or startled uttered a sharp repeated
whistle.
" This caged bird was generally fed on dry pulse or grain,
but he also evinced a great liking for cooked potato and raw meat
of all kinds, in fact h(c) appeared to be omnivorous, readily
devouring earthworms, insects of all kinds, fruit, berries, green
herbs, etc. He was supplied daily with a dish of fresh water, and
was accustomed to bathe in it with evident delight. At one time
he occupied the same division of the aviary with a pair of
Australian King-doves which had commenced to breed. The doves
were allowed to bring up their first brood in peace, but when the
hen bird began to build a second time, she was closely watched by

upon the nest and devoured it. The innocent little Ring-dove
continued to lay on in spite of the repeated robbery, and had at
length to be placed beyond the reach of her persecutor. During
the day the Piopio was unceasingly active and lively; at night
he slept on a perch resting on one leg and with the plumage
puffed out into the form of a perfectly round ball, the circular
outline broken only by the projecting extremities of the wings
and tail. Every sound seemed to attract his notice and he betrayed
an inquisitiveness of disposition which in the end proved fatal;
for having inserted his prying head through an open chink in the
partition, it was seized and torn off by a vicious Sparrow-Hawk
in the adjoining compartment of the aviary."
Little is known of the wild life of this bird as it had almost
disappeared before there was much active interest in the New
Zealand bird-life by naturalists. It frequented the undergrowth
in the dense forests and was never seen beyond the confines of the
thick vegetation. It was of feeble flight and obtained most of its
food from the ground which consisted of insects and berries. It
was chiefly noted as a fine songster, writers stating that it was the
finest vocalist of New Zealand's feather forms.
The South Island species, which differs very considerably from
the bird under discussion, is supposed to linger in one or two of
the very remote patches of forest which the Government have
grudgingly set aside as reserves in the southernmost part of the
South Island. I spoke to several people who knew these forest
reserves well and spent a considerable time every year in them,
but none had ever seen the &lt;# Piopio " as it was called by the
Maoris, though they did see upon rare occasions the South Island
Robin (Miro australis).

By C. S. Webb
The object of this expedition was to collect alive some of the
rare and local forms of bird-life which inhabit the forests of the
Usambara Mountains in N.E. Tanganyika. The port for this
region is Tanga, some six hours south by steamer from Mombasa.
It is very pleasantly situated and is opposite the island of Pemba,
famed for its cloves. Tanga is the outlet for all the produce of
the Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru districts where large
quantities of sisal and coffee are grown. Much of the intervening
flat country has been cleared of all bush to make way for the
monotonous looking sisal plantations and in many places there
are large rubber plantations which have been abandoned owing
to the unremunerative price of rubber. In both cases this means
the disappearance of nearly all bird-life in the areas concerned.
The Eastern Usambaras are situated about 35 miles east of Tanga,
the highest points being about 4,000 feet, and are covered almost
entirely with magnificent evergreen forests. At Amani, 3,000 feet,
there is an important government agricultural research station
with a large scientific staff, and it was largely owing to their
assistance in many ways that I was able to accomplish so much
in an otherwise hopeless area to collect in.
The birds in general are more interesting to those concerned
with their classification and the study of their habits rather than
to the aviculturist, there being numbers of local forms of dull-
coloured insectivorous birds which would be quite unattractive in
captivity. On the whole birds are distinctly scarce and the
limited number of interesting species coupled with the difficult
nature of the country makes collecting very difficult indeed. It
is almost impossible to go anywhere without a great deal of
climbing as there are no flat stretches at all in these mountains
and unless one sticks to native footpaths, the undergrowth is very
troublesome.

212 C. S. Wehh--Notes on a Collecting Trip to N.E. Tanganyika
One of the most conspicuous birds in this region is the Silvery-
cheeked Hornbill (Bycanistes cristatus), a large species which is
quite plentiful and can be seen at most times in a large flock.
Much has been written about the extraordinary nesting habits of
Hornbills, but many interesting details concerning the nesting
period have only recently been discovered. With the Silvery-
cheeked Hornbill (as with other species) the female is sealed in
a cavity in a tree with a muddy substance which sets hard, a slit
being left through which the male bird feeds his mate. Recent
observations have shown that she remains penned up in this prison
for over four months, during which period the eggs are hatched
and the young birds become fully fledged, the male bird feeding
the whole family. Even when this stage is reached, it is the male
which re-opens the cavity and liberates the inmates. It is
interesting to note that this is not done until the young are
capable of flying strongly. Why this method should be adopted
by such large birds with powerful bills, well able to deal with
any natural enemies capable of reaching the nesting site, it is
difficult to say, but it evidently works very well judging by the
numbers of Hornbills in existence. It is not easy to suggest the
origin of such a habit; perhaps one of the original Hornbills
had a faithless wife or one who could not be bothered with the
monotonous duty of hatching eggs and he settled the problem by
shutting her up. Anyway nowadays the female is in such a state
of subjection that she stays where she is put and in this respect it
seems that Bycanistes cristatus has succeeded where Homo sapiens
has failed. I feel sure that this instinct in the Hornbill is so
strong that if anything happened to the male, the female would
starve to death on the nest instead of liberating herself.
If these birds breed annually as is believed, the poor hen
must spend a third of her existence in a sort of prison with hardly
room to move. What would happen to the man who treated birds
like this in captivity? And yet nature has given her approval
of such methods.
These birds when not nesting, return nightly to the same
communal roosting place and may be seen crossing the valleys at

a great height returning from distant feeding places late in the
evening.
Sunbirds are not numerous in these evergreen forests, there
being an insufficient supply of suitable flowers on which to feed.
The commonest species is the Olive Sunbird (Cyanomitra
olivacea changamwensis), a dull green species with yellow pectoral
tufts which is highly insectivorous. An interesting species is the
Violet-backed Sunbird (Anthreptes longuemarei neglectus) which
is rather rare and lives in the canopy of the forest and subsists
mainly on insects and berries. Another tree-top inhabitant is
the Grey-chin Sunbird (Anthreptes tephrolaema rubritorques),
which is very rare, in fact so far only two skins of this race have
been obtained, so I was fortunate in capturing one alive. This
species is also highly insectivorous and is one of the most

<table confidence="0.731641" page_id="56219767"  page_num="213" year="" vol="">
charming Sunbirds I ever possessed, being delightfully tame and
very intelligent. The nectar-loving species such as the Scarlet-
chested Sunbird (Chalcomitra senegalensis aequatorialis ), Kirk's
Amethyst Sunbird (Chalcomitra amethystina kirkii) and the
Little Bifasciated Sunbird (Cinnyris bifasciatus microrhynchus)

<bodyText confidence="0.98589094117647" page_id="56219767"  page_num="213" year="" vol="">
are to be found in the Bush country which surrounds the mountains.
The Golden-winged Sunbirds frequent the highest parts of the
Western Usambaras at an elevation of about 6,000 feet where
there is no evergreen forest and where their favourite food-plant
the leonotis, is plentiful. The Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris
mediocris usambaricus), a pretty little species with a bright red
breast-band, is also fairly common at this altitude in the scrub
forest.
The smallest and one of the most beautiful Sunbirds in the
mountains is the Little Collared Sunbird (Anthreptes collaris
elachior) with its shiny green upper-parts and head, and bright
yellow under-parts and blue breast-band. They become exceedingly
tame in captivity and soon learn to take small mealworms from
the hand. They are somewhat similar to Zosterops in habits and
have a similar varied diet.
The natives in this region sometimes catch birds with the aid
of bird-lime made locally from the sap of certain trees. Birds

&amp;apos;caught in this way by people whose last consideration is for the
condition of the birds' plumage, are usually in a very bad state
and I strongly discouraged this method of capture. I constantly
impressed upon the natives that anything brought to me must be
uninjured and with undamaged plumage. Being accustomed to
their crude methods I was rather surprised to see a native arrive
one day with some Sunbirds which were perfect in every detail.
It was a mystery to me as they were obviously not caught with
lime or snares and I knew that they did not employ nets. The
condition of the birds showed that they had all been caught
quickly as they showed no signs of hunger which they soon do by
puffing out their feathers. My cook boy informed me afterwards
that they had been caught with fermented coco-nut water. This
is a sweet, clear liquid, which is very intoxicating and had been
put into the flowers where the birds fed. Having once tasted
this delicious brew, the birds, following a good old Spanish custom,
did not think of departing until they were full up. By this time,
unfortunately for the birds, they were decidedly under the influence
of drink and were easily caught by the natives. This trick is also
played on monkeys and baboons, when they become too mischievous
in the native plantations, the ordinary coco-nut " milk " being
replaced by manufactured coco-nut beer, and when the animals
have had " one over the eight " and have become stupid they
are promptly attacked and killed with sticks or bows and arrows.
An interesting bird to be found near Amani is the Yulturine
Fish Eagle (Gypohierax angolensis) which only appears in those
parts of Africa where palm-oil fruits are found. This seems
rather extraordinary for a Fish Eagle, but the evidence seems
conclusive that these fruits are an essential part of the bird's
diet, without which it would not survive for very long. Another
bird of interest is the Palm Swift (Tachynautes parvus myochrous)
on account of its peculiar nesting habits. The nest is always
attached to a palm leaf and is so small and shallow that it might
be called a ledge. The movement of the leaf in a breeze would
normally dislodge the eggs but this is overcome by sticking the
eggs to the nest with saliva. As these palm leaves are severely

tossed, about in any. sort of wind the young birds must cling to
the nest almost before they are properly out of the shell, otherwise
they couldn't possibly remain there.
One of the difficulties of collecting in mountainous regions is
the fact that many species of birds are confined to certain altitudes
which means establishing a collecting base at various altitudes
in order to get a varied assortment.
Among the seed-eating birds obtained must be mentioned the
beautiful Peter's Spotted Waxbills (Hypargos niveoguttatus),
which are usually to be found in pairs at some distance from
the mountains on the edge of the forest. Not being gregarious
or attracted to a call-bird, the capture of these retiring birds
which skulk in the undergrowth requires a considerable amount
of patience and labour. I found that a number of these birds,
but only the hens, were infected with a small kind of leech in the
eyes. These parasites are only found right inside the eye-sockets
and are not visible from the exterior. One is found usually in
both eyes in the inner corner and extraction is rather a delicate
operation as the eyelid has to be forced back, and with a pair of
tweezers, which have been filed to a very fine point, the butt-end
of the leech can be grasped and the culprit extricated. They
tunnel into a cavity on the inner side of the eye-socket and
sometimes disappear completely when efforts are being made to
dislodge them, and if not removed the bird eventually dies in
every instance. They are quite f in. long when extended and
must cause tremendous discomfort to the birds. It is interesting
to note that it apparently only occurs in Peter's Spotted Waxbills
and only in this district.
One of the rarest and most difficult birds to get a glimpse of,
let alone capture, is the Red-headed Blue-bill (Spermophaga
ruficapilla cana), a very pretty but quaint looking bird which
is rather a specialized feeder in its wild state, living almost
entirely on the seeds of a large type of forest grass known as
Olyra latifolia. As this grass is dotted about here, there, and
everywhere in the vast mountain forest, it is exceedingly difficult
to come in contact with these rare birds, and their capture was

one of the slowest and most laborious tasks I have ever under-
taken. Another shy but interesting inhabitant of the undergrowth
is the Red-eyed Crimson-wing (Cryptospiza reichenowi sanguino-
lenta), a few of which I was able to capture in nets. Perhaps
the most elusive of all the Waxbills is Hartlaub's Spotted Waxbill
(Mandingoa nitidula chubbi), which is green above and black
below, spotted with white, and the male having a red face. These
birds are smaller than Peter's Spotted Waxbills and are very shy
and rare. They appear to be nomadic and have no partiality for
any one spot, and seem to simply wander where the spirit moves
them. Although widely distributed very few people have ever seen
one, and this was the first occasion on which I had met with this
species, and then only one pair, which I was fortunate enough to
capture. One of the most charming of all the forest birds is the
Forest Weaver (Ploceus bicolor kirsteni) which can be heard at
most times uttering its sweetly pretty call notes. This striking
looking species is entirely insectivorous and arboreal and spends
most of its time hunting for insects in a clinging position like
the English tits. It is not gregarious and it differs entirely in
most of its habits from the ordinary weavers. When breeding
they successfully avoid their natural enemies by attaching their
nest to an isolated liana which cannot be reached from any side.
Red-capped Robin-Chats (Cossypha natalensis) are fairly
numerous throughout the forest and Heuglin's Robin-Chats
(Cossypha heuglini) are to be met with sparingly in more open
situations. These latter have a beautiful song, and are altogether
very charming birds. One pair which I eventually caught used
to visit regularly a patch which I had baited with millet seed for
Peter's Spotted Waxbills, thus confirming what I had noticed on
previous expeditions that Robin-Chats like to supplement their
usual insectivorous diet with a few seeds. The beautiful White
starred Bush-Robin is found at higher altitudes and only occurs
in the W. Usambaras, where the vegetation is more stunted in
growth. The climate at this altitude (6,000 feet) is delightful and
bracing, a great contrast to the hot and humid atmosphere of
the E. Usambaras, where I did most of my collecting. In the

C. S. Webb--Notes on a Collecting Trip to N.E. Tanganyika 217
lower forest regions at the beginning of April there is quite a
big influx of the brightly coloured European Orioles, on their
migration northwards, and occasionally the South African Oriole
(Oriolus auratus notatus) can be seen, which can be distinguished
in the field by its yellower wings, these being for the most part
black in the European species. A different bird entirely is the
striking looking Green-headed Oriole (Oriolus chlorocephalus ),
which is confined to the evergreen forests of East Africa. On
account of being so local this bird is far from being well known,
although in its native forests it is one of the most conspicuous
birds on account of its bright coloration and peculiar call-notes.
Of the insect pests to be found in these areas perhaps the most
annoying are the jigger fleas, those homely little fellows which
burrow under one's toe-nails and lay their eggs. Altogether I
was favoured by the attentions of eight of these creatures---not a
very pleasant experience when a lot of walking has to be
done as they leave a nasty cavity under the toe-nail which is very
sore and sometimes slow in healing. Another pest is the Safari
ant. These are the marching variety and go along in millions and
will kill and eat anything alive. They are very troublesome at night
and an Amani resident told me he lost forty-two young turkeys
in a night in this way. Fowls are frequently killed, especially if
broody, and one has to be especially careful with puppies or
anything that has not the sense to clear at the first sign of danger.
I had fifteen large and rare chameleons in a wire netting
enclosure which were all killed and eaten one night, and by the
morning only the skeletons remained. For safety all my birds
were kept on benches and tables, the legs of which were standing
in vessels containing paraffin. It is not an uncommon thing for
people at Amani to be driven out of their houses in the middle
of the night because of a visitation of Safari ants, in which case
one must stay with a neighbour until they have passed on. They
usually defeat all efforts to drive them out, on account of their
incredible numbers.
To revert to birds, I must mention that ornament of the forest,
the Crested Guineafowl (Guttera pucherani), which is found in

flocks in certain parts of the lower Usambaras. Being terrestrial
in habits they are caught fairly easily in snares by the natives.
This species is adorned with bright blue skin on the upper neck,
which has the appearance of being in folds, and its red face,
pretty black crest, and delicate markings on the plumage go to
make it a very handsome bird. They become quite tame within
a few days of capture and make delightful pets. Being forest
dwellers they are to a large extent insectivorous and probably
eat little else in their wild state. The curious looking folds of
blue skin on the neck baffled numbers of passengers on the way
home and quite a lot asked me why I had tied blue ribbon round
their necks. Whilst on this subject I might mention that the
number of " brainy " questions asked by passengers on such a
voyage is truly amazing. Some of these are very funny, such
as when one man asked me if I knew the botanical names of all
my birds, and an old lady, after surveying some Waxbills,
came out with the priceless remark " Are these what they Call
dickey birds 1 " To quote one more, a missionary woman, after
watching some Blue-headed Waxbills huddling up together in their
customary manner, remarked " and do they remain true to one
another 1 " A few examples such as these will suffice to explain
why collectors sometimes take to drink.
A few of my birds were collected at a considerable distance
from the Usambara Mountains, viz. Falkenstein's Sunbird
(Cinnyris venustus falkensteini) and the East African Mariqua
Sunbird (C. mariquensis suahelicus), which came from the base of
Mount Kilimanjaro, and the Blue-headed Waxbills (Urseginthus
cyanocephalus), Tanganyika Melba Finches (Pytelia melba grotei),
and Grenadier Waxbills (Granatina ianthinogaster) from further
south in the Central Province in the scrub bush country.

By Mrs. K. Drake
The cock Sugar-bird came to me two or three years ago, the hen
only last summer.
This season I thought I would try my hand at breeding them, so
I gave them an aviary to themselves. They very quickly paired and
made a hasty, but at the same time exceedingly neat, nest of the
materials I provided, viz. fine hay, moss, wool, and hair, in as hollow
open box inside their very small shelter, which measured about 2 ft. 6 in,
by 2 ft. 6 in. by 14 in. deep, raised high above the ground. The flight
is about 10 by 10 by 6 feet wide.
Two white, or rather bluish-white, eggs, with dark red splashes
(rather resembling a Nonpareil Bunting's egg) were laid in May and
the young birds reared for only four or five days. They quickly went
to nest again, and two more eggs were laid by the 6th June, the first
having been laid on the fourth evening ; and they hatched respectively
on the 16th and 18th June. The cock bird seemed to take no duties
upon himself, and became excited after four or five days ; so I made
up my mind this time to remove him, and I soon discovered the hen
was perfectly fit and able to take on the job of rearing herself.
The young left the nest on the 29th June and 1st July and flew
well, and in a few days they appeared to be receiving instructions from
their parents on the art of fly-catching.
They were fed chiefly on tiny flies caught in the flight. I also gave
a few mealworms, insectivorous food, milk-sop--yes, and orange !
Grapes they were very keen on, and also banana. The young soon
helped themselves to grapes and orange, and later banana ; flies, too,
I am sure they caught at the end of a week.
The young birds are a dull greyish-green colour and pale underneath;
the beaks are smaller than those of the adults, but quite in comparison
with their size, also they are not curved. They are now a month old
and fine little chaps, and the mother still gives them a few mealworms
and seems very fond of them.

I found wasps a great trouble, not only in eating valuable fruits, but
causing great annoyance to the parent bird, until I arranged a few
bottles filled with light ale and sugar and hung them on the outside of
the aviary. I caught them by hundreds, and fortunately not a single

so well when shown last season, have nested and reared one young bird. Two
eggs laid 22nd and 23rd June hatched on the 6th July. These birds were
in a cage 42 inches long by 20 inches wide by 2ff |inches high, with a pair of
Yellow-winged Sugar-birds. The young I found thrown out on the floor
of the cage. Thinking the Sugar-birds were the culprits I removed them and
replaced the young, only to find the young again on the cage floor, almost at
once. I removed the cock, and for five days all went well, then one young
one died, so I thought it best to risk returning the cock. He promptly helped
feed, and the young bird is now out of the nest, the cock still feeding it. The
young bird came out of the nest on 9th July.
Unfortunately it is blind in one eye owing, I think, to being thrown out
of the nest twice. I am sending on the bits of shell I was able to save.
Colour when hatched, bright orange ; no fluff until four days old, then a
little black.
It is now a brightish green all over, flights exactly like the adult birds.
They have built a new nest. Both parents build, but the hen alone
incubates. I think the hen will lay within the next day or so. First nest
built of fine hay in a wooden soap-box type nest, the new one in a small wire
travelling cage.
Food as usually supplied, i.e. nectar and sponge cake, insectivorous food
and hard-boiled egg with cut up mealworms, pear, orange, apple, and grapes
in separate dish.

THE DIAMOND SPARROW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9541195" page_id="56219785"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
(Steganopleura guttata )
This beautiful Finch occurs on the coastal regions of Southern
Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and the south-east of South
Australia. It is a favourite with aviculturists, being extremely
beautiful, easily kept, and occasionally a good breeder, though in
this respect individuals differ greatly, some refusing to breed at all.
These birds become extremely tame, and as a rule agree well with
other occupants of an aviary, though here again individuals differ,
some proving spiteful towards any weaker bird.
As the sexes of the Diamond Sparrow are, to all intents and
purposes, alike, it is difficult to be sure when one has a true pair.
The male is generally slightly larger than the female, has a broader
band on the chest, and blacker lores; but given these supposed
distinctions, it is none too easy to be sure of selecting a true pair.
It builds its nest of grass, lining the inside with finer grasses and
feathers, in any convenient situation, such as a box, basket, or
small travelling cage hung on the wall of the aviary. Of its wild
life Neville Cayley gives the following interesting account: " Like
many other species of Finches, the Diamond Sparrow is very sociable
in habits, breeding freely about houses and gardens, and visiting
the same nesting-trees season after season, if unmolested. Its large
bottle-shaped nests are to be found in a great variety of situations,

J. Delacour--Breeding the Hooded Pitta
often as many as a dozen or more being built in the same tree.
Orange- and lemon-trees, climbing roses, and thick garden shrubs
are utilized, and in some districts, as Gould states, the underneath
portions of the large stick nests of Eagles and Hawks---probably
selected with the idea of protection from enemies. On several
occasions the nests of the Double-bar Finch and Diamond Sparrow
have been found built in the lower portion of the nests of Whistling
Eagles. In one of these tenements as many as four nests of the
Double-bar and nine of the Diamond Sparrow were counted, all the
birds living contentedly under the protection of their rather for-
bidding, but to them harmless, hosts, the Eagles. During the
mating period the male is very domineering, ordering his spouse
about in no gentle manner. She remains submissive until the nest
is built, when she takes charge, becoming a veritable shrew, ruling
both her mate and home."
The habit described by Mr. Cayley of nesting in colonies is very
interesting, and the lack of success in breeding this species, which
so many aviculturists have experienced, may be due to the fact that
only single pairs have, as a rule, been kept.
In the wild state the Diamond Sparrow feeds chiefly upon the
seeds of grasses, but also devours small insects, and in captivity
canary and millet seed, flowering grass, and an occasional meal-
worm seems to be all that it requires.

(Pitta cucullatd)
By J. Delacour
Although many species of Pittas have been introduced into
Europe during the last twenty years, most of them very beautiful,
none had so far bred or even nested in captivity.
Pittas are forest birds, living on the ground and only perching
at night, and have insectivorous habits. They hop about noisily
on the carpet of dead leaves, not wild, but often difficult to see.

It was clear that a thickly planted aviary, with a moist atmosphere,
was the only accommodation to try to induce them to nest, and
I always thought my greenhouse-aviaries were very suitable for the
purpose. In fact, since the beginning, I always kept in them
some Pittas, in perfect condition. Their feet, which are very
tender, kept in good order, and their colours, which often fade
in cages, remained as bright as they are when at liberty.
Pittas prove quite harmless to other birds, even as small as
Humming Birds, but they are most intolerant to one another. It
is almost impossible to keep two together, even in a large aviary
and cock and hen of the same species, and this has been the
principal obstacle to their breeding in confinement.
In the early spring of 1933, however, I succeeded in keeping
together two Hooded Pittas (Pitta cucullata ), a species which is
often imported from India and extends to Indo-China and the
Malay Peninsula. Both sexes are alike, of a pretty, soft green
colour with a black and chestnut head, a crimson belly, and lovely
shining blue patches on the wings and rump.
There was no doubt that the smaller bird was a female, as it
had dropped a couple of eggs shortly after it had arrived. The
other one was taller, with a stronger bill, and gave the impression
of being a male, rightly enough. At a few days' intervals, in
May, 1933, both birds were let out in a large compartment of the
tropical aviaries, 40 by 15 feet, -with a temperature of 65 to 90
degrees all the year round. It is thickly furnished with tropical
plants, and contains a blue water lily pool. There live some forty
to fifty Humming Birds, Sunbirds, and small insectivorous species,
as well as a dozen Chinese Quails. None of them seems to be noticed
by the Pittas.
Each bird kept to a corner, under the thick vegetation; both
were always quite tame, and readily fed at one's feet. When
they met there was nothing more serious than a short fight, and
for months they lived as far apart as they could from one another,
in a state of armed peace. On 10th April, 1934, the cock started
calling loudly from the top of a tree, where he seldom ascended
before, and such serious struggles took place that I was almost

obliged to separate the Pittas; but at the same time they were
seen casually picking up and carrying about nesting materials.
I left them alone, and by 20th April they began to build a nest on
the top of a dry stone wall, all covered with plants, about 4 feet
high. The male was the first and principal worker, but the female
helped also. There were no more disputes now between them.
As the Pittas were pulling out plants and roots, I provided
them with small sticks, hay, dead leaves, and moss. All were
used, and by the 26th the main work was completed. The nest,
as is well known, at liberty, is a covered-up affair, the size of a
football, with a large opening in front, level with the ground.
The Pittas then worked at the inside, lining it with fibres, moss,
rootlets, and decayed leaves. On the 30th I saw the cock feeding
the hen. The first egg was laid on 2nd May; it was short and
rather rounded at both ends, white, spotted with pale reddish
brown. Eggs were laid the next three days, and both sexes sat
tightly on 6th May, frequently replacing one another, every hour
or so. Being very tame, one could touch them in the nest, but
sometimes they became annoyed, and flew savagely at one's face.
The first egg hatched on 18th May; on the 20th there were
three young birds, the fourth egg containing a well-developed
chick dead in the shell.
A curious circumstance is that the chicks almost immediately
poke their head out from their parent's breast, and even come
out on the edge of the nest, probably on account of the heat. The
result was that, twice in a few hours, I found one of them fallen
on the ground below the wall. I put it back, without injury, but
to avoid further accidents I built in front of the nest a small
platform of sticks and hay, where they could comfortably disport
themselves, and no more trouble occurred.
The chicks are naked, of a reddish flesh colour, the fore part
of the head being black; the bill is orange yellow, as is the gape.
Both parents fed the chicks mostly on cut up bullock's heart,
with meal-worms, a few earth-worms, and insectile mixture.
They are not difficult to feed, and I believe meat alone would be
sufficient to rear them. Naturally they always had a liberal

supply of it. On 24th May one young one disappeared, and
was never found.
Feather sheaths quickly appeared, and the growth of the
youngsters was very quick. They came out more and more on
the platform now, so much so that on the 31st one was out of
the nest, flying well enough. The weaker one also came out, but
was found half drowned in the pond, and just saved. A small
screen was put up to avoid further accidents. But it was of no
avail, and this same young Pitta was drowned on 5th June, after
having been flying well for several days. Both parents fed the
remaining young bird devotedly, and did not abandon and bully
it as I had feared, as the mother had started laying again in
the old nest on the 31st, while the cock began another nest, further
away, in a similar situation. Probably on account of the
stimulating food, the hen laid every day, as many as ten eggs, by
12th June. She insisted on laying in the old nest, and all but
one egg dropped on the ground. The old nest had been kept very
clean, the parents taking right away the droppings of the chicks,
but the cock had by then completed the new nest and would not go
to the old one again. The birds were not sitting. On 13th June
I removed the old nest and put eight eggs into the new one (I thought
ten were too many). Very docile, the hen went to the new nest
and incubation started immediately. Two eggs, probably addled,
were rejected after a few days. At the same time, both parents
continued feeding their first young, now quite strong, and eating
also by himself since 12th June. However, on the 21st, I took
him by hand (he is very tame), and removed him into another
compartment, where he now lives happily.
The first plumage of the young Hooded Pitta is as follows :
top of the head streaked dark brown and dull chestnut;
under parts earthy brown, rather pale; belly and vent pale pink;
nape black; upper parts blackish green; quills, as in the adults,
but duller; greater wing coverts dull black with whitish terminal
and subterminal spots; lesser wing coverts blackish green; rump
pale blue; bill brown, with tip and gape yellow; legs and feet
greyish pink.

226 J. Delacour--Breeding the Hooded Pitta
Green feathers appeared very soon, and by 20th June had
almost completely replaced the brown ones on the under parts. A
complete moult into adult plumage took place on the beginning of
August.
On 23rd June the head of a chick was observed, and four the
following day. At once a platform was built in front of the nest.
On 11th July, on my return from the Ornithological Congress
at Oxford, the four young Pittas were out of the nest, and they
all have been fully reared.
But we now come to the sad end of the story, and we shall
see that, like the Thrushes, Pittas have the most wicked and
puzzling temper.
As soon as the young ones had left the nest, the cock Pitta, whose
plumage, and especially the quills, were in a very worn state,
started at once building another nest, this time on the ground, but
against the wall. I provided him with the necessary materials; the
hen helped a little and, by 15th July, the nest was almost completed.
I noticed that day there was a fight between the two parents, but
I thought it was only, as usual, an introduction to their mating,
and paid little attention to it. The next day the hen was chasing
the cock, who kept hidden most of the time, and I decided to keep
a special watch on the Pittas. I went into the greenhouse every
hour or so, to see how matters w~ere going on; it was very much
the same. But at the end of the day the male was found dead in
the pond ! There is no doubt that the female, whose wings and
other feathers were still perfect, pushed him into the water and
prevented him from getting out. He was in perfect health
otherwise, and had no visible wounds.
The hen has not laid up to now; it is very probable that the
male wanted to breed again; but she refused to do so, hence the
struggle with its tragic end. She carried on feeding the young
ones and still is looking after them most devotedly to this day.
I only hope that, among the young birds, there will be a male
to replace his father. I have also got now a pair of Macklot's
Pittas in my greenhouses. But I have only three compartments
large enough and suitable for the breeding of Pittas.

The Yellow-crowned Penguin (Megadytes antipodes)
This very handsome Penguin is found very sparingly on the
Otago Peninsula near Dunedin, in the South Island, and through
the kindness of Mr. Black, a member of the Avicultural Society who
resides in the above-mentioned city, I was taken to a rookery in an
isolated bay on the peninsula.
This small colony of birds inhabited a patch of scrub situated
on a piece of sloping land running up to the base of high cliffs.
The whole of the scrub was intersected by a network of pathways
worn by the birds. These pathways were cleared of vegetation to the
height of about 3 to 4 feet, being about the height of the birds,
so that one had to crawl on one's hands and knees to penetrate into
the tangle of vegetation.
There were evidences of long occupation by the birds, for certain
stones which seemed favourable roosting places were surrounded by
thick piles of excrement and feathers. The birds were not so tame
as I expected and upon sight of us they hurried up the hill-side and
disappeared into their holes in the ground. It is surprising how
high these birds can climb, in fact right up the face of the cliff
nearly to the summit. We saw quite a few birds disporting them-
selves on ledges high up on the face of the cliffs, which they could
only reach with the utmost difficulty, but it is very surprising
where these very determined birds will get when once they try. The
strength and tenacity of a Penguin are amazing, even of the tiny
little blue fellow found so commonly around the coasts of New
Zealand.
We caught several of these birds in their rookery and brought
them down to the beach to photograph. They bite savagely, and,
when once they have got a hold, thrash one soundly with their
flippers. They move with great agility in the woods but when
chased on the open beach they throw themselves down on their
breasts and lever themselves along with their flippers; at other

times they move along with a very dignified walk. Seeing Penguins
in their natural state one is surprised at their great beauty. One
gets no idea of what a Penguin is really like from the poor, dejected
specimens which are usually exhibited in zoological gardens and
menageries. Their feathers have the most wonderful silken sheen
which is lost in the captive bird. It simply makes my heart bleed
to see these wretched creatures confined in the miserable twopenny
or threepenny shows one sees at fairs and such-like places.
Awkward as a Penguin is on the land it is amazing to see the
lightning rapidity with which it can move when once in the w T ater.
A tired and exhausted bird will fight its way by inches to the water,
until it at last sinks down as it reaches the very water's edge : as
soon as a wave comes and the bird is borne into its natural element
all is changed and no fish can equal it for grace and lightning
speed. The Cormorants are sluggards when compared to the
Penguins in the ease with which they move under water. The small
and isolated colony which we visited was composed of about twenty
or more birds, which according to Mrs. Black, w T ho had known them
for many years, never seemed to increase. Often these inoffensive
creatures provide targets for despicable wretches with guns as they
pass by the beach in launches, and fishermen will slaughter every
bird which they think takes a single fish out of the sea. Very
fortunately this small colony is in an isolated spot and far from
the beaten track, so there is a fair chance of their survival.
The Yellowy-crowned Penguin is a large bird almost equalling the
well-known King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonica) in size, but is
thicker set and has a shorter beak. A striking feature is the very
thick-set legs and feet which are a bright rose pink and also the
bright yellow feathers of the head which are like spun glass. This
is one of the rarest of Penguins and is only found in a few spots in
the southernmost portion of the South Island and on a few of the off-
lying islands to the south, such as the Campbell and Auckland
Islands.
The South Island Weka (Galliralius australis)
It is a strange thing that while the Kiwi and Kakapo, those
strange representatives of New Zealand flightless avifauna, are

known to the world at large, the Wekas or Woodhens are practically
unknown to the general public outside New Zealand. Not only are
the Wekas amongst the most peculiar and distinctive of New
Zealand's flightless birds but they form one of the strangest groups,
of birds known, and have always puzzled naturalists in regard to
their true position in the classification of birds. Their scientific
name " Gallirallus " implies that they are a connecting link
between the gallinaceous birds and the Rails. At first sight they
resemble huge, thick-set Rails, the size of a domestic fowl, and though
they possess fairly large wings they are quite incapable of flight,
depending upon fleetness of foot to escape their enemies, which
would be very few before the Europeans came to New Zealand. In
fact, in the forest and manuka scrub they will out-distance the
fastest dog owing to the rapidity with which they can move in the
undergrowth. Of course, in the open they would soon be out-
distanced.
Once exceedingly numerous over the whole of New Zealand, the
Wekas are to-day almost extinct mainly owing to forest fires, dogs,
and the bird proving itself a nuisance to the colonists. In the early
days of settlement no bird was tamer or more familiar. It
frequented the environs of camps and farm-houses always with an
eye on the main chance. It was exceedingly bold and aggressive,
seizing any food which was lying about, or even snatching it out of
the hand. Its unbounded curiosity caused it to enter houses and
camps and bear away any small movable articles, especially small
bright objects such as cutlery, watches, etc. When encouraged no bird
is more familiar than a Weka but, alas! the early colonists being
mostly a set of hard and unfeeling people, bent only on the destruc-
tion of the native flora and fauna, the Weka found very little
sympathy with them, .especially when it was known to take fowls'
eggs and chickens, so dogs and shooting soon diminished their
numbers, until this bird is a rara avis in New Zealand to-day.
I have been in many districts where a few years ago these
strange birds were very numerous, but now through persecution
they have become very rare and the few remaining birds exceedingly
wary. While it was possible to hear their weird calls at night it

was never possible to get a glimpse of the birds themselves, except
perhaps an odd bird which was picked up dead on the road having
been killed by a motor car. It was only upon going to Kapiti
Island that I saw Wekas in the bold and aggressive condition in
which they were in when the country was first colonized. Here they
were exceedingly familiar, living around the caretaker's house on
the look-out for any scraps of food, etc.; and although nocturnal in
their habits, they could be seen at any time of the day feeding
upon clotted milk which was left in pails in the open. So bold
and aggressive did these birds become that at last a wire-netting
fence had to be erected round the garden to keep them away. Even
now odd ones manage to get through the fence and wander into the
house picking up any small article and running away with it.
I once saw one carrying away a watch with a waistcoat attached
to it! I heard of a man who was very proud of an expensive set
of false teeth, as they were very costly years ago in New Zealand.
Once when in a forest he espied a nest high up in one of the trees :
this he endeavoured to reach, but before ascending the tree he took
the precious teeth out for safety, placing them on a log, but just as
he reached the nest a Weka quietly slipped out of the undergrowth
seized the teeth, and disappeared. Search as he could our friend
never found the teeth and, needless to say, never forgave the whole
tribe of Wekas.
These birds never seem to miss anything in the way of food, and
woe betide any picnic party who leave their lunch unattended for
a short space of time where the birds are found. Mr. Wilkinson,
the caretaker of Kapiti Island, told me many interesting things
about these birds as he had been very familiar with them for many
years. He said that they were the greatest enemy of all ground-
nesting birds as they invariably destroyed both eggs and young
ones. Often when a nest was being photographed a Weka would
come to investigate and destoy the nest and contents. He told me
of a young Weka which he once caught out of a family party, and
upon being restored again to the others, the female at once set upon
it and would have killed it, had it not been rescued in time. He
also mentioned that once he took the eggs from a Weka's nest but,

just as he was in the act, the cock bird rushed up, seized the eggs
one by one out of his hand, and took them to a place of safety.
Young Wekas are peculiar looking creatures and rather resemble
young Cranes covered with black down.
I shall never forget my first view of one of these birds, it was
in the forest on Kapiti Island. The bird was at the foot of a wall
of rock over which water trickled in just sufficient quantity to keep
in a state of perpetual dampness the wonderful collection of ferns
and mosses which covered the huge face. The bird seemed far more
like a mammal in its demeanour than a bird. It was full of
curiosity yet it seemed to half-control its feeling, pretending not
to see us and yet getting closer and closer as we stood and watched it.
It rather reminded me of the women in the working-class street who,
when a motor car stops outside one of the houses, find that the front
window or doorstep need cleaning, going about their business in a
\0x25A0seemingly casual way yet all the time being consumed with curiosity.
These birds are inhabitants of the thickest forest, usually where it
is damp and marshy, and in their diet they are omnivorous, nothing
seems to come amiss to them.
One would naturally think that such a bird as this would make
a delightful pet. I did until I was disillusioned; a more cruel or
dirtier bird it is impossible to imagine. It is impossible to keep any
-other kind of bird with them, short of Ostriches. They will kill
anything : some I know burrowed into the next aviary and in a
few minutes had killed and devoured a Pigeon and a Rail. Even
amongst themselves they are extremely vicious. One minute the birds
will be caressing and feeding each other; the next, one will be
holding the other down trying to brain it by raining hard blows with
its dagger-like beak on the victim's skull. During the time the
birds referred to were kept together, before separate aviaries were
built for them, they nearly tore each other to pieces, the cock losing
an eye. After this the other bird always attacked its mate from the
blind side.
In a few days they will ruin the largest of pens, tearing up plants
and shrubs, digging up the turf, and altogether making the place
into an absolute quagmire. Their water pot they will immediately

fill with mud, the food pots are turned over and the contents
emptied. It is also necessary to have wire or boards 2 or 3 feet
below the surface, or the birds burrow out. Mice and rats
*
stand little chance in an aviary where the birds are, in fact in
the wild state it preys largely on these obnoxious introduced
mammals and in that way helps to counteract the harm it does in
destroying native birds.
The call of the Weka is a shrill scream which can be heard from
a great distance. Heard on a lonely road in the stillness of the
night it is apt to be rather upsetting to one's nerves. The bird
also makes a low noise exactly like that of a motor boat.
Very few wild Wekas which I saw looked in good plumage.
I think this may possibly have been that the birds fight a great
deal, though some birds which I saw in captivity were in remarkably
good condition, the plumage having a wonderful gloss.
Four species of Woodhens are recognized by naturalists, one
from the North Island and three from the South. Although the
Black Weka (Gallirallus troglodytes) is not supposed to be found
in Stewart Island, I have seen a very dark form there which is
certainly not the South Island species. I also saw a pair in
captivity which had come from Stewart Island which were undoubt-
ably the Black species. These birds were very attractive, being very
tame and in the most wonderful condition, the plumage having
a remarkable gloss which I have never seen in any other bird. This
pair of birds reared young ones every year. Unfortunately I was
not in time to secure a pair. This species is certainly the most
striking of the four and in life appears to be a glossy mottled
black. After death the feathers fade to a dirty blackish brown.
On Stewart Island their calls can frequently be heard in the
late evenings and the birds are often seen as the twilight falls,
creeping about the damp coastal forests. These birds get most of
their food from the seashore, feeding upon dead fish cast up by the
tide and small Crustacea which they find amongst the seaweed.
Like the other three species this bird is disappearing from both
Stewart Island and the mainland, and there is little doubt that the
next twenty years or so will see the end of these intensely interesting

and unique birds except for the birds on Kapiti Island, which by the
way are not pure bred, being hybrids between the North and the
South Island species. Wild cats and weasels no doubt play havoc
with the young birds, though I dare say either of these pests would
hesitate to attack an adult bird.
The Paradise Sheldrake ( Casarca variegata)
It was an unexpected joy to find these beautiful ducks
comparatively common in the alpine regions around Mount Cook.
They were to be seen by the ice-cold rivers which flowed over the
glacial moraines often just below the terminus of the glaciers them-
selves. What the birds fed on was a bit of a mystery, for there
would be no aquatic life and very little vegetation. They were
nearly always in pairs, the male and female conversing with
each other all the while, each bird having an entirely different note.
Where there is a small flock the sexes are always even. These birds,
as if knowing what very conspicuous objects they are, are very
wary and difficult to approach.
Seen in flight in these inhospitable regions with the sun shining
on the lovely plumage, this bird well deserves -its name, for it is
then that the very striking colours which are hidden when the bird
is at rest are displayed. It is an exceedingly strong flyer and seems
as much at home in the air as on the water, in fact in captivity
this bird is not nearly as aquatic as most of the true ducks and in
&amp;quot; its habits of grazing and nocturnal rambling it shows itself to be
more nearly allied to the geese than the ducks. To my way of
thinking it resembles a goose far more than a duck, being very
similar in habits, form, and colouring to the well-known Egyptian
Goose.
On the first night of my arrival on Kapiti Island I noticed some
small white, ghostly objects moving about on the flats below the
house. I was at a loss to know what they could be until I asked the
caretaker, who told me that they were the ducks of this particular
species whose white heads stood out so conspicuously against the
dark vegetation. It seems as though some birds, especially New
Zealand ones, can do without sleep : such birds as Wekas, Keas,

and the various duck one never sees asleep either in the day-time
or at night. I have certainly never seen a Paradise Duck asleep and
I have had occasion to see them at all times of the night and day.
I think that this species does most of its feeding by night.
A few years ago this Sheldrake was thought (in Europe) to be
exceedingly rare and almost extinct, but although not common, it
certainly seems to be holding its own and at the present moment
seems in no danger of extinction. Once it was found in great
numbers in the Nelson District on the various " sounds ", and
large numbers were shot for the Wellington markets, but since those
days the birds have been very much thinned out and are seldom
seen in large flocks.
This bird seems equally at home on either fresh or sea water
and many birds are found around the various sea-coasts, feeding
to a large extent on the marine life. Though not originally found
on Kapiti Island several pairs have been introduced, but not very
successfully, I think, the birds in time flying over to the mainland
and getting shot. At the time I was on the island, contrary to their
usual habits, the sexes seemed to agree to part, the drakes going to
one part of the island and the hens to another.
To my mind there is something very pleasing about the beauti-
fully vermiculated plumage of these birds. The two sexes are very
dissimilar, the female being a much brighter coloured bird though
the male is considerably larger. The male has the head glossy
black with greenish reflections. The body feathers are mainly black,
finely vermiculated with white, grey, and rufous. The wing coverts
are snow white, the secondaries glossy green except the inner ones,
which are rather elongated and a bright chestnut. The hen has a
pure white head and neck, the body feathers are bright chestnut,
the feathers minutely vermiculated with grey, black, and white. The
hen has an " eclipse " plumage, in which she somewhat resembles
the male.
At the present moment there are quite a few breeding pairs in
Europe and it is to be hoped that these increase considerably, for
they are very intelligent and very ornamental, although extremely
spiteful to all smaller waterfowl. Some Grey Duck kept in the

same enclosure with a pair of these Sheldrakes gradually got so
used to the persecution by the latter pair of birds that they used to
allow them to grab them by the tail and run round until the
Sheldrakes grew tired and released their hold. On the bend of the
wing is a hard bony knob. Buller, the New Zealand naturalist,
wondered what its use was. Had he have kept any tame birds he
would have known. A very tame and intelligent drake I possess
will, upon my going into his enclosure, seize my trousers in his bill
and thrash my legs with his wings, often making very severe and
painful bruises, the female all the while keeping up a very loud
shrill cry. In fact, the whole time a human being is in sight she
keeps up this noise. The females of this species, both in a wild state
and in captivity, are extremely loquacious. The hen always keeps
the head in the air when calling, but the male holds his head near
the ground.
When green food is thrown into the enclosure, the female Shel-
drake, though not eating any herself, will stand upon it for many
hours so that the other birds are unable to reach it. Though the
drake vents his spite upon human beings, the hen confines hers to
the other ducks, who seldom get much peace. I think that pugnacity
is very much developed in nearly all New Zealand birds. Why this
should be so I cannot understand, for they had practically no
enemies and did not trespass on each other's feeding grounds, but
it certainly seems to have reached its zenith in this species for it has
the reputation with nearly all waterfowl keepers of being the most
savage of all waterfowl.
The New Zealand Grey Duck (Anas supereiliosa)
This duck differs from its congenitor in Australia (A. s. rogersi)
in being much darker in colour, otherwise it is very similar. It is
certainly the commonest duck in New Zealand, and even in these
days when it seems the object of every duck shooter to get his
picture in the illustrated -weeklies as soon as the shooting season
opens, with his body festooned with strings of slaughtered birds, a
bunch in each hand and a large display on the ground in front of

with the bird's natural enemies destroyed, such as Falcons and the
huge native eels, which must have taken a large toll of young birds,
the position must be about balanced.
Unfortunately the Mallard has been introduced into New Zealand,
and the males, being a bigger and more aggressive bird than the
native birds, have purloined most of the female Grey Duck in the
districts where they are common in the South Island. The hybrids
being fertile it will only be a matter of a few years before there
are very few pure bred Grey Duck left.
I found this duck far more common in the South Island than in
the North, possibly because of the larger amount of water in the
South Island and the population being smaller.
On several small lakes which are privately owned and where
the owners fortunately protect bird life, these duck can be seen
in thousands when the shooting season opens, for few species of duck
are slow to show their appreciation where they are welcome. In
captivity these duck seem like most of the order, very intelligent.
I often wonder why duck with all their attributes are not more
widely kept, for few birds make more delightful pets and are
more easily kept than the smaller ornamental varieties.
In its habits it seems to differ very little from the Mallard, a bird
to which it is allied, except that it will at certain seasons frequent
woods and forests and also that it frequently builds its nest high
up in trees. It is stated that the young ones are carried down to
the water in the beaks of the parents. This seems much more likely
than the old-fashioned idea of the young being carried down on the
back.
This species fortunately seems very well established on orna-
mental waters in this country, so that when there are no more pure
bred birds left in the wild state we shall still have them here.
The New Zealand Shoveller (Spatula rhynchotis)
I was unfamiliar with this species in a wild state, though in
certain parts I believe that it is not uncommon, but it is not so
generally distributed as many of the other species. It is certainly
the most handsome of the smaller native duck, but the adult

plumage is not assumed until the second year. This species is more
aquatic and insectivorous than most species. It feeds mainly on
minute insects which are sifted through the remarkable bill. The
bird moves rapidly along the surface sucking up the water, which
passes out at the side of the bill, all the minute aquatic life being
strained through the prominently developed lamellae of the bill and
the bristles on the tongue.
Shovellers are difficult birds to import. I once brought some
birds home on a voyage and soon found that they became paralysed
if denied access to water. This was remedied by borrowing large
copper cooking pans from the chef and giving the birds a daily
swim. I also strewed the water with a little fine insectivorous food
which the birds greatly enjoyed.
Altogether eleven species of duck are found in New Zealand.
Of these, two are practically extinct, three are stragglers from
Australia, only five being very distinct and are not found outside
New Zealand. Of these I only saw four species. Had I spent more
time in the South Island no doubt I should have seen more.

These birds are bred in Japan as domestic birds, in the same
way as Canaries are bred in Europe. As they have no great
attraction in themselves, aviculturists are not as a rule very anxious
to breed them in this country. The main features of these birds are
that they make wonderful foster-parents, and can be used for
rearing valuable foreign birds such as Gouldian, Parrot, Parson,
Cherry, and other valuable Finches.
This practice of using Bengalese Finches as foster-parents is
commonly adopted by breeders in Japan. I understand that it has
been tried by various aviculturists in this country for this purpose,
and in some cases has been successful and in others unsuccessful.
In order to ensure success, I would mention a few details as to the

selecting of these birds for foster-parents. The breeder of foreign
Finches should purchase about five or six pairs of Bengalese Finches,
and allow them to mate. Before using them as foster-parents it is
essential to mate the birds, each pair in a separate box-cage. When
a hen starts laying you will find that she always stays in the nest,
and the cock feeds her. In this case you are quite safe in placing
any foreign Finches' eggs in the nest in place of the Bengalese eggs.
If you find that the hen is often out of the nest during this period,
this means that the cock bird is neglecting to feed her, then it is
not advisable to use these birds for fostering purposes.
You will often find that a good cock Bengalese is feeding the hen
on the eggs in the day-time, and will take her place during the
night, and that a dark brown or black-and-wdiite coloured bird
is much more useful than a bird of a lighter colour, for this purpose.
The cage should be kept as dark as possible during the time of
breeding, except where the birds feed, which should be light. They
should also be disturbed as little as possible.
In conclusion, I would like to mention to our members who take
an interest in the breeding of foreign Finches, that they will find
the Bengalese Finches are of most valuable assistance to them as
foster-parents.

appeared in the November number of our Magazine in 1926. After
the birds were acclimatized indoors, they were turned out into a
large aviary. The blue cock took to his yellow wife at once, and
although they mated and laid for two years, all the eggs were
infertile. I then mated the blue cock bird to a normal coloured green
hen, and in 1930, for the first time, they reared four beautifully
strong young ones all of which were green. In 1931 the same pair
again reared three fine young ones, and they again were green. In
1933 I paired the blue cock bird to one of his daughters. She laid
three eggs, two of which were infertile, and the third one contained
a partly formed dead chick. This year the same two birds were
again mated, and by the 20th March three eggs were laid. One
young one was hatched out on 14th April, and the other on 15th
April, and the third egg was infertile. A few green feathers were
noticed on one young one on the 4th May, and on the 5th May one
blue feather was seen on the other young one. By the 7th May
several blue feathers were seen, but we were not certain this young
one was going to be a beautiful blue before the 12th May, when he
was covered with blue feathers. Out of the two young in the nest one
is a normal green, and the other a beautiful blue. Both birds left
the nest on the 9th June, and they are as healthy and strong as any
birds that I have bred. The parents were marvellous and looked after
the two young most devotedly. As I have been trying for over ten
years to establish the blue variety, I am more than pleased with
the result, and hope next year to breed one or two more. Besides
this pair, I have two more pairs of blue bred birds, and out of these
I hope to get some more blues. One pair of these blue bred birds
(brother and sister) produced two very fine young ones this year,
but both of these are green.
The lutino hen Alexandrine mated to a normal coloured green
cock keeps on producing green young ones. Next year I hope to
mate it to one of her sons when I should get lutino young ones.

A few notes in general about the birds at Lilford during the
past two years may possibly be of interest. The collection, of course,
has had its losses, but as these have not been considerable, by adding
and breeding we still have some interesting birds.
Season 1932 passed much as usual; Eagle Owl, Laughing
Kingfisher, Peacock Pheasant, Javan Jungle Fowl, and certain
others reared their young. Duck of various kinds nested, our best
results probably in this direction, as in 1933, being the rearing
of a small brood of Black-billed Tree Duck (D. arborea). A pair
of these, during the late summer of both seasons, nested in a hollow
log about 2 feet from the ground. Incubation, taken part in by both
male and female, lasted in each instance a remarkably long time--
thirty-five days. The young, on hatching, took to the water at once
and, assisted by both parents, were successfully reared after being
walked into a pool aviary. In the down, these youngsters, being
long in the leg and possessed of a young plover-like carriage,
differed considerably of course from the young of the true ducks.
Their colouring was black and white, a loud check of almost
draught-board regularity. They feathered at an early age, and
when full grown differed chiefly from their parents by the white
centre stripes of the long flank feathers being narrower.
As regards additions, w r e have concentrated on quality rather
than quantity; the most interesting birds acquired being a beautiful
pair of Donaldson's Touracous, and some of the more uncommon
Curassows, Lesser Razor-bill, Slater's, etc. One curiosity received
some time ago is a Boat-bill (Canchroma cochlearia), a stork-like
little Heron with an asinine expression and an ungainly bill.
The Raptors have been enriched by a beautiful Snowy Owl; the
waterfowl by Eyton's Tree-duck (D. eytoni), Versicolor Teal (A.
versicolor ), and three red South American Shovelers (S. platalea ).
Thanks also to the generosity of an aviculturist, Mr. Ronald Stevens,
recently returned from South Africa, our solitary male Red-billed
Pintail has now the companionship of others of its kind.

The Geese added include Ashy-headed, Lesser, and Blue Snow,
and a particularly smart little pair of the rarely imported Cackling
Geese (B. canadiensis minima). The latter, less than our Brent in
size, are, of course, Canada Geese in miniature, but remarkable for
their dainty feet, tiny bill, and different note. Roughly speaking,
this charming little bird compares to the bulky Canadian much as a
Bantam to a farmyard rooster.
In reviewing part of the above list, I may refer to the well-
known Touracous as birds suitable to a -well-bushed aviary, easy
to cater for, and ever pleasing with their olive-green plumage,
crimson trimmings, and quaint behaviour.
The Curassows also, like others of the group which we possess,
are confidingly tame, and from their rat-proof size and few require-
ments--grain, nuts, seeds, etc., are very easy to keep.
Referring to the South American Shovelers, 2 c?, 1?. The males
are conspicuous amongst other ducks by their tawny black spotted
plumage, pointed tails, and pearly grey heads. Our female is
much like a small and pale edition of S. clypeata , but having the
upper part of the tail white and, like the male, the bill shorter and
darker. Both males occasionally utter a peculiar connected
" Clutter-cluck-cluck
In emphasizing the insectivorous requirements of the Shovelers
in general, it is interesting to note that a pair of the examples
under notice went entirely off grain, and from May to November
(until the first frost) subsisted entirely upon such natural food as
they could procure. The nature of this appeared to be water bugs,
etc., sifted from the water by means of the delicate membranes of
their peculiar bill. Well known as it is this habit of the Shoveler of
extracting its food from the water in this manner, I cannot but
think it remarkable that from a moderately sized pond crowded
with about ninety duck, sufficient nourishment could be found to
support this pair.
Our Parrots at liberty are still much in evidence. The Indian
Ring-necks (P. torquatus) now number about eighteen. Some of
them nest annually in natural cavities of trees within a mile from
home. The first indication of nesting is usually noticed when the

males come alone to feed, later the females accompany them again,
but often with soiled plumage. Usually from one to three young
are reared. These can be distinguished when flying by their shorter
tails.
In a recent number of this Magazine mention has already been
made of the domestic affairs of our Macaws. These continue very
fit, and are incubating again this year. A Sulphur-crested Cockatoo
which had been at liberty for some years is now confined on
suspicion of interfering with the nesting Macaws. At large, this
bird was very noisy, flopped about like a great Snowy Owl, and
was much respected by others of the group at liberty.
Another bird now perfectly contented in a large aviary is a
pink-breasted Australian Galah. This example was well known
in the district, being at liberty for about fifteen years. Occasionally
it wandered as far as 4 miles away, but invariably returned
each morning and evening to be fed. Once it went down a chimney,
but was safely retrieved, and later, when disturbed from roost by
a falling bough during a gale, almost came to grief in the lights
of a passing car.
Referring to the wing power of Parrots at liberty, each species,
of course, like our native birds, has its own mode of flight. The
Macaws, when taking long flights, sail along with laboured wing
beats, the blue and yellow probably making fewer beats to the
minute than the red. On fine summer evenings I have observed the
always active Ring-necks frequently indulge in high aerial exercise.
At these times they fly in wide circles, pack like Sand Grouse, and
turn and twist with amazing rapidity. The Galahs, which are fine
movers, indulge in grand circling sweeps, uttering their fine call
at the time. To those people, also, whose acquaintance with the
African Red-tail is confined to the monkey-on-a-stick-like behaviour
when caged, it is a revelation to view&amp;apos; the activity of the bird as it
whips along with a woodcock-like flight, cleverly missing timber at
every twist.
A real tragedy during the period covered by these notes was the
loss by escape of a beautiful pair of Hyacinthine Macaws. These,
possessed of most formidable bills and the Macaw family predilection

for destructiveness, bit through the stoutest wire netting obtain-
able, and escaped one day at noon. Nothing more was seen of them
that day, but early next morning a familiar carrion-crow-like croak
was located from the sky, and both birds were identified several
gunshots high making a bee-line for some high timber 3 or 4
miles distant. Following them there, it was found they had moved
on. To cut short these unpleasant reminiscences, I need only
add that a bitterly cold spell setting in at the time, both birds
were eventually recovered 14 miles distant, injured and exhausted
beyond recovery.
In making passing mention of 1934, our most promising
youngsters to date, 15th July, are seven well-grown South American
Shovelers, 3 Javan Jungle Fowl, 1 Japanese Crane, and various
broods of duck. Our very recent additions, some of them owing
to the lamented death of the late Mr. G. H. Gurney, include Pileated
and Buff-backed Herons, Tiger Bitterns, Black Storks, White-
backed Trumpeters, White and Patagonian Black-cheeked Ibis,
White-crested Jay Thrushes, and one very interesting and rare
Maleo (Megacephalon maleo )\0x25A0--a curious pink-breasted bird which is
a native of Celebes.

It is a rather curious fact that cock birds with a strongly
developed paternal instinct often display, both in freedom and
captivity, the utmost annoyance and distress should they have reason
to believe that their mates are neglecting their domestic duties.
Sometimes the trouble arises through the hen being, in her
husband's opinion, unduly slow in starting to lay and sit, but the
male may be quite as upset--in fact, in some cases much more so--
should his partner imperil the safety of the eggs or young by
remaining long off the nest when they need brooding. How a cock
bird can know that the safety of his offspring is endangered by lack

The Marquess of Tavistock--Neglect of Duty
of maternal warmth is more than I can say, but that he does know
all his actions seem to declare in a way which renders any alternative
explanation of his conduct very difficult. I think the strongest and
most significant example I ever knew was that of a cock Many-
coloured Parrakeet at Keston who, when his wife, for some
unaccountable reason, struck work when the babies were still quite
tiny, went in and brooded them himself all night. A cock Many-
colour is no more naturally given to brooding young than is a
domestic cock, and this particular bird, as far as I am aware, has
never repeated the action, the necessity for it not having again
arisen.
Doves, as aviculturists are well aware, are often sadly deficient
in those virtues wherewith popular sentiment has endowed them,
and a pair of Diamond Doves in a friend's aviary recently provided
a most distressing example of parental conflict over a matter of
child upbringing. These Doves were young birds without previous
experience of the successful rearing of a family. They had tw T o
nests earlier in the year, one producing a chick dead in the shell,
the other a young one that only lived a few days. Whether the
death of the latter was due to the hen neglecting to brood it
sufficiently I cannot say, but from his subsequent behaviour it
rather looked as though the cock was of that opinion. The third
venture was more successful, the nesting continuing to flourish for
about ten days. The hen brooded it as usual during the night of the
tenth day, and her mate relieved her when she came off for breakfast
in the early morning, but when the time came for her to take
another spell, to his horror and disgust she flatly refused, saying,
no doubt, that it was a very hot day, and that anyhow the baby
was quite old enough to do without brooding. The cock, on the
contrary, was certain that it was still far too young to be left, and
his rage and annoyance knew no bounds. He chased his neglectful
spouse about the aviary, not merely pecking her as a male Dove will
do when driving his hen to nest, but striking her with his wings-
and sitting on her, not merely metaphorically, but also literally !
Not only was he angry with her, but he was out of humour with the
whole world, and savagely hunted the Canaries sharing the same

aviary, although he usually ignored them unless they got in his way.
After some hours of intermittent conflict, the hen gave way and
brooded the young one for about two minutes. The cock then went
on to the nest and also brooded for two minutes, after which he
came off and renewed his attacks on his partner. Evidently she had
said to him, " You can sit on the child yourself if you are so
fussy," and he had replied, " I shall sit just as long as you do ;
if you imagine you are going to put all the work on me you are
very much mistaken. Do you suppose that your husband is a
Tinamou, I should like to know 1 " As the day went on the conflict
increased in bitterness and, finally, about 7 o'clock, culminated in
a prolonged battle on the top of the unhappy cause of the dispute i
To save it from being trampled and battered to death, we finally
decided to remove it. As soon as this was done peace was instantly
restored; the erstwhile combatants sat lovingly side by side and,
after the manner of doves, began thinking about their next effort
in the nesting line ! After giving them further time to cool down
thoroughly, we returned the young bird, and the hen brooded it
during the night.
Next day, though there were one or two squabbles in the morn-
ing, the domestic atmosphere was less tense, and by evening the cock
had accepted the position, evidently concluding that his wife,
though a bit of a fool in some ways, on this occasion might, after
all, be right !

So popular has the Budgerigar become in all civilized countries
that several books have been devoted to its culture as an aviary bird,
but the authors of these only knew it as such, and had not had an
opportunity of meeting with it in its original home, Australia. The
latest book on this most attractive Parrakeet, however, has been
written by an Australian in Australia, who knows it in its wild life

as well as in his aviaries. Mr. Cayley is a thoroughly good
naturalist, aviculturist, and artist, and as such is well qualified to
write books giving the best information and instruction that their
readers can want. We are most of us familiar with his two previous
books, What Bird is That? and Australian Finches in Bush and
Aviary. Both are excellent as regards letterpress and coloured
illustrations, and now his new book, Budgerigars in Bush and
Aviary, makes a fitting companion to the other two.
The way in which the Budgerigar has lent itself to variety
breeding, and in a few years has produced a large number of colour
types is nothing short of amazing, though the danger is that soon
it will be difficult to find the original type which, after all, is an
extremely beautiful creature. I think we should do all in our power
to keep this wild type as nature intended it to be, however attractive
the various new colours may be, for, after all, these are no more
than artificial productions.
Mr. Cayley's chapter on the Budgerigar in the Bush is extremely
interesting. One naturally supposes that the Australian climate
is the ideal one for Australian birds, but we read of seasons when
the heat was so great that many thousands of Budgerigars and other
birds died from the excessive temperature. When one reads of
120* Fahrenheit in the shade, one wonders whether we are not
far better off here, for the seasons with us are rarely bad for breed-
ing Budgerigars.

I bought the parent birds from the late Captain Rattigan and, although
I have had them for two years, they never got farther than a half-hearted
attempt to build a nest. About six weeks ago they set about nesting in a
business-like manner, and there was no mistaking their purpose. They built
a very deep, loose nest, composed of the finest grasses and horse hair. I
ventured to build up the sides myself, otherwise nothing could have remained
in it. I got it secure and the birds did not appear to object to my interference.
Two little blue eggs were laid and duly hatched after a period of ten days.
One chick died, as the stronger seemed to get all the food, and the old birds
were apparently content to feed the first comer. This youngster has thrived
immensely and left the nest after only ten days. It simply would not remain
at home, and hopped about the flight in a disgracefully unclad condition, for

it had no feathers except on its wings. It has now been out six or seven
days, and is quickly getting its feathers. The parents are very attentive,
and are much more confiding since the baby arrived, coming to my hand for
white mealworms--the newly-skinned ones--which is the only live food I have
been able to provide.
I am wondering whether it is usual for these New Zealand Zops. to leave
the nest so early. The old ones seemed to regard it as a natural event.

When I was in Bombay a few weeks ago I called on an aviculturist there,
and amongst the birds he had was an Albino House Mynah. He very kindly
gave me this bird, and I brought it home. I have it now in my aviary, and
it seems to be doing well. I thought this might interest some of your readers,
as I have never heard of an Albino House Mynah before. I would be pleased
to hear if any of our readers have heard of one before.

THE AMERICAN MUSEUM'S WHITNEY EXPEDITION

<bodyText confidence="0.898993" page_id="56219811"  page_num="247" year="" vol="">
Having heard complaints of the wholesale collecting of rare birds by the
members of the above expedition, we gladly reproduce the following letter
from The Auk of July, 1934, a copy of which has been sent us by Dr. Frank
Chapman.-- Ed.
" Editor of The Auk.
" On behalf of the American Museum of Natural History, I beg to acknow-
ledge your courtesy in permitting me to reply to the letter which, under date
of 27th April, 1934, the Marquess of Tavistock writes to you for publication
in your pages. In so doing, however, I must express my regret that considera-
tion for his fellow-workers, if not protection for himself, did not induce the
Marquess to attempt to confirm the charges he makes against this Museum's
Whitney Expedition before giving them publicity. The facts are as follows :--
" Of ' the small Lory ' which the Marquess states ' is only found on a
mountain in the interior of Viti Levu ' and which we are said to ' have
apparently exterminated ' by ' killing no less than forty-seven ' specimens,
we secured twelve examples all taken during a short one-week trip, proof to

Correspondence
those familiar with the difficulties of mountain forest collecting that the
species is by no means rare; nor is it restricted to the island of Viti Levu,
but is also found on other large islands of the Fiji group. There are, for
example, specimens in the British Museum from Taviuni.
" Of the Masked Parrot ( Pyrrhulopsis per sonata), we took not only
' eighteen ' but twenty-six specimens. However, the work of Beck, our
collector, showed that this species is neither rare nor threatened with extinc-
tion. Viti Levu, the island it inhabits, exceeds in size the whole of south-
eastern England (counties of Kent, Sussex, Surrey, and Middlesex) and the
greater part of it is still unexplored. That in a short visit Beck could have
secured so large a series of this forest-inhabiting species is evidence of its
abundance, while the restriction of his labours to a limited part of its range
renders it obvious that he could not have seriously affected its numbers.
" As for the Norfolk Island Parrakeet ( Cyanorhamphus cooki), which Beck
is said to have ' decimated or exterminated ', he secured two specimens.
The ' great mischief ' ' it is feared ' that Beck did on Antipodes Island
appears to be restricted to collecting five specimens of the island Paroquet
(Cyanorhamphus unicolor) and two specimens of the Snipe ( Coenocorypha
auklandica tristrami). Incidentally, it may be remarked that the existence of
thirty-three specimens of the former and twenty of the latter in the Rothschild
Collection has not aroused criticism. Moreover, since Beck's visit to Antipodes
Island in 1926, Oliver ( New Zealand Birds, 1930) writes that both this Paroquet
and Snipe are common there.
On the whole, therefore, I believe we may assure the Marquess that his
* trust ' that the reports to which he so unfortunately gives credence are
* exaggerated ' is warranted. His concluding suggestion that we breed
specimens for our collections has, at least, the merit of novelty. But studies
of insular evolution, for which the Whitney Expedition was primarily
inaugurated, and also of other phases of geographical variation, based on birds
raised in aviaries would not, in our opinion, be acceptable contributions to
the science of ornithology.
" I confess that I am at loss to understand why persons who make or repeat
these charges against the American Museum do not write direct to us for
information, rather than to a third person. We have nothing to conceal, and
if excess of zeal should have led our collector to violate the ethics of his
profession we should be among the first to admit and regret it. Our critics
do not appear to be concerned with either the object or the results of an
undertaking to which at great expense we have already devoted fourteen
years, and which bids fair to occupy as many more. Nevertheless, we hope
that they may be interested to learn that there have already been published,
chiefly by the American Museum, forty-four papers based on Whitney Expedi-
tion collections, and that these merely mark the beginning of our studies of
this unique representation of island bird-life. Also, we are now preparing to
send a second expedition to the Pacific to make paintings and collect accessories
for the production of large Habitat Bird groups for a hall in the new Whitney
wing of the Museum which will be wholly devoted to a popular presentation
*of the work of the Whitney Expedition.

THE SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF
DUFRESNE'S WAXBILL
By Elsie Robinson
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99755355" page_id="56219821"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
This season I have experienced the greatest thrill of my existence
as a member of the Avicultural Society, in bringing off successfully the
breeding of a full clutch of four Dufresne's Waxbills (Coccopygia
dufresnii ).
In sending a photograph of the youngsters a few notes appended
may be of general interest to members of the Society.
The cock bird was purchased December, 1932, the hen June, 1933,
from one of our London importers. During the winter they were kept
in a bird-room, temperature under 60*, and allowed the freedom of the
flight from early May onwards, when they commenced to nest almost
at once. I gave a plentiful supply of hay, string, and feathers from
which they built their nests in various positions, such as under the
growth of climbing plants. Although the birds, throughout, have been
persistent sitters, their efforts were in vain as both the first two clutches
of eggs proved unfertile.
The third nest was commenced the third week in June, incubation
commencing with the first egg laid. The cock and hen took turns in
sitting, their regularity being almost amazing, for not once did I catch
them changing their turn, owing to their quick, shy habit of entering
and leaving the nest. My suspicions were aroused about 23rd July,

by the cock bird creeping all over the bark of an old tree in the aviary,
apparently looking for insects. I managed to curb my curiosity and
check the impulse of looking into the nest, deciding that, at any cost,
I would wait until such time as I might hear chirping before I would
take the risk, or venture too near the nest.
I will try and give some interesting details of the parents feeding
their young.
The first week the cock bird busied himself looking for insects,
being incessantly on the move, searching the bark of the old dead tree,
creeping over it as one notices our Tree-creeper doing, and I am at a loss
to understand how he could find sufficient food to keep the four
youngsters supplied until the second week, when he and the hen
started eating spray millet. I noticed also, about this time, they
went after larger flying insects and I gave what assistance I could by
shaking any insects from large trees in the garden into an open umbrella,
and so into the aviary. I might mention a sycamore tree was the best
hunting ground.
I find they will not touch the cocoon of the pine ant, though the
very small one of the meadow ant was eaten during the third week
and onwards, but still the majority of the food was spray millet.
One youngster left the nest first, 6th August, the others following
within four days. The parents were remarkably attentive, shepherding
and feeding unceasingly, getting them back into the nest at night in
a very clever manner. Ten days after leaving the nest the young were
feeding themselves and have never looked back, being very strong
and sturdy; in fact, at the moment, they so closely resemble the mother
it is difficult for a novice to distinguish them.
They are the most attractive young birds I have yet bred, being
almost finger tame. At the time of photographing they allowed the
camera, on a tripod, to be brought up close and even the movement
of the dark cloth did not disturb them unduly--so interested were they
in the proceedings that only when the shutter went off with extra
noise did they fly off, to return a little later for another group or
position. The photograph was taken on 16th August, ten days after
their leaving the nest.
I reared them in a flight with two pairs of Bichenos, both of which

The Seven Bicheno Finches reared at the same time and in the same Flight as the
Dufresne's Waxbills. This photograph was taken within a week of their leaving the nest.

had nests ; making me very nervous as to what would happen when
the young Dufresne's decided to fly, but all ended well and the
Bichenos reared seven young between them.
The young birds, in plumage, closely resemble the hen, if anything
the colouring is of a lighter and softer nature. Head and neck lavender
grey, fading to white under chin and throat and shading off into saffron
on breast. Back soft olive, upper tail-coverts orange. The rest of
plumage is a soft lavender grey. Beak pearly black.
Today, 1st September, finds the pair with still another nest of four
eggs, but I do not anticipate any result as the young birds have been
using the nest at night, even going to the extent of driving the parent
birds away. This did not, however, prevent the old birds from sitting
on the eggs in the day-time. I am rather surprised at the young birds
taking to the new nest as they had already settled into other sleeping
quarters.

her brother, Mr. F. Robinson, on securing the very excellent photo-
graphs which are herewith reproduced.-- Ed.]
1934: THE THINGS THAT DIDN'T COME OFF
By The Marquess of Tavistock
1934 has been a moderate season, partly spoiled by the abnormal
cold of late spring and the abnormal drought of summer. In our
delightful climate one can usually reckon that it will snow and freeze
intermittently until the end of the second week in May. After that
there is some prospect of warm nights. This year, however, it froze
until the end of the first week in June with the result that whatever
other records the close of the year may show, 1934 is an easy winner in
my avicultural experience in the matter of producing egg-bound hens.
The Ring-necks were the chief sufferers and have been a complete
failure. One pair of lutino-breds had three eggs, only one being fertile,
but the hen died within a few days of hatching. My two young lutino
hens paired, one to a lutino-bred and the other to an ordinary green :
both got egg-bound after laying an egg or two and refused to sit when

returned to the aviary. I gave them a long rest and returned their
nests when the warm weather at last arrived, but although their mates
tried hard to induce them to make a second attempt they never settled
down again and finally dropped into moult.
Their mother, who always gets egg-bound on the smallest provoca-
tion, I kept back from nesting until 15th May. She laid her usual two
eggs but only hatched one youngster and it died when a week or two
old, from what cause I cannot say.
A lutinistic Plumhead, paired to her two-year-old son, had clear
eggs and later, unfortunately, the young cock died, so only one remains
of the four I bred from lutinistic parents in 1932.
An imported cock Malabar was paired to a young hen I bred a few
years ago. She had laid successfully at Keston. She took to her nest
and then got ill and continued to get ill every time she was returned to
the aviary until in desperation I put her in another aviary and gave
her mother to her former mate. The old hen is a great hand at
getting egg-bound unless kept very warm, but rather to my surprise,
though she made rather heavy weather of it, she completed a small
clutch late in May. The eggs were, however, infertile, as the cock
was starting to moult and would not pair.
An imported hen, who had laid successfully two years ago, was
mated to a cock I bred. She dropped two eggs from the perch and then
got egg-bound. Her last egg, laid in the hospital, she sat on when
returned to the aviary but it disappeared after about a fortnight.
Though very beautiful, Malabars are tiresome birds to manage. They
come into breeding condition very early and usually go off early ; are
very subject to egg-binding ; can only rear healthy young in natural
tree-trunks in the open flight; and get frost-bitten toes on the very j
slightest provocation.
I had great hopes of breeding Racket-tailed Parrots this year, but
the hen behaved just as she did last season, going into the nest quite
a lot but getting no further. I recently acquired a second pair of this
very lovely but uncertain Parrot. Unfortunately the hen died of
paratyphoid within a few days of her arrival and was probably infected
when she reached me. The cock promises to become an even finer
specimen than my present one --if he lives !

The Marquess of Tavistock--1934 : Things that didn&amp;apos;t come off 253
The lutino Amazon, as usual, took a fair amount of interest in her
nest and came into breeding condition, but her mate, a fine-looking,
but wing-stiff and stupidly nervous bird, would take no notice of her.
Once more I am going to change the cock. The new bird I found
in a cage outside a dealer's shop and bought owing to his obvious anxiety
to breed. Already he is a most ferocious brute and when mated is
likely to put even the late-lamented Koko in the shade for pugnacity.
Leadbeater's Cockatoos had two lots of eggs, the first damaged or
addled ; the second, clear. I have changed the cock as this is their
second season of failure.
A hen Bluebonnet imported during the winter was mated to a cock
that had been kept some time in England. She did not get further
than occasionally looking at her nest and she declined her mate's
efforts to feed her. She is an extremely timid bird.
A hen Norfolk Island I had kept in a flight-cage all winter dropped
into moult as soon as I obtained the loan of a cock. She went into the
nest occasionally and the cock was seen to feed her, but one or other
wasted most of the summer moulting.
A pair of albino Roseate Cockatoos took no serious interest in their
nest, but they are young and still rather wing-stiff from close caging.
A rather second-rate hen Barnard, bred in 1932 and paired to an
imported cock, came into breeding condition but refused to take to the
nests we offered her. I substituted a fine imported hen but the cock,
with the fidelity common in his species, was unutterably bored with her
and had to be reunited to his first love. A new cock, obtained for
the second hen, was out of condition on arrival and did not breed.
Two pairs of Brown's failed to produce eggs. One hen spent a lot
of time in the log but could not overcome the passion for moulting
characteristic of this species in the summer months. They start to
moult in May because their ancestors did it in Australia, and when the
other birds begin to moult in July they feel it would be eccentric not
to fall in with the prevailing custom of the country and so they moult
a second time then ! The hen of the other pair has bred in former
years but last autumn, for some reason, she become a violent feather-
plucker and this season seems to consider that the abandonment of
the vice is an adequate substitute for domestic duties !

A young hen King Parrakeet bred in 1932 seemed on the point of
nesting for some time but she never quite settled down to her tree-
trunk and no eggs appeared.
Another imported hen, mated to an exceptionally fine cock, laid
five eggs but to my surprise all proved clear.
The old Sula Island King, mated to a cock from Salwatty Island,
never seemed satisfied with the nests we offered her and finally dropped
one egg from the perch.
A pair of Mealy Rosellas, imported during the winter, looked like
nesting when first turned out, but the hen is very nervous and never
settled down, though her mate did his best to persuade her.
The Worcester's Hanging Parrot, paired to a Golden-backed, laid
three eggs on the floor of the shelter and abandoned them after a half-
hearted attempt at incubation. Usually she lays in a box, but the eggs
are always clear.
The Banksian's first lot of eggs, as usual, proved clear and the Palm
Cockatoos have again done nothing.
The Grey Parrots have also disappointed me. After years of
fruitless search I actually obtained two genuine cocks. Unfortunately
the one I put with my old breeding hen died suddenly. He was a
foolish bird and even when he had found out where the food was would
sit on a perch till he was starving sooner than climb down to it, and
this, I fear, helped to terminate his career. The other cock I mated
to a new hen that had been a cage pet for many years, and she never
properly came into breeding condition although for several weeks the
male was very busy preparing the nest for her. The old hen (naturally !)
laid infertile eggs from the perch, but large Parrots take so long to mate
and re-mate that I did not attempt to change them over. Genuine
cock Greys are very big birds and very wide across the skull between
the eyes. They have long necks and powerful beaks and the eyes are
bold and round. The other supposed indications of sex recorded by
various earlier writers (and myself !) are of no value at all. A hen
Layard's Parrakeet, paired to a Plumhead, got egg-bound twice.
She is very amusing when this misfortune overtakes her, as she is tame
but cordially detests both her owner and the aviary attendants and
likes them to understand that in her opinion they are the poorest of

poor fish ! Consequently, when assailed by physical infirmity, she
makes a gloomy but not too successful effort to appear as though
nothing were wrong with her, much as strong-minded ladies of the human
race are apt to do when compelled to submit, as invalids, to the un-
welcome ministrations of despised relatives ! Whether as a protest or
not I do not know, but her second egg she never laid at all, gradually
re-absorbing it in the astonishing manner of which birds are sometimes
capable. Some weeks later she produced a clutch of two eggs during
warmer weather, but the Plumhead had begun to moult and the eggs
were infertile.
The greatest disappointment was with the White-capped Parrots.
The hen laid four eggs in a grandfather-clock box early in May and
as the cock murdered his offspring last year, we removed him to an
adjoining aviary when the young birds were due to appear. Two
eggs hatched and the young lived about a month, when they died within
a few days of each other. As their crops were full, the hen probably
failed to brood them sufficiently and they got a sudden chill.
The pair are usually fearless and spiteful but the sight of a horse and
cart, even at a distance, terrifies them to an extraordinary degree.
Two other disappointing failures remain to be recorded. I had
obtained a new cock Queen of Bavaria Conure as my former one was
always infertile. This year the hen laid three eggs and hatched two
young which were killed, I think by the cock, at a fortnight and a
month old respectively.
A new pair of Layards, to my great surprise, went to nest two
months after arrival, though the hen was pinioned. Three young
were hatched but they died for no apparent reason when a few
weeks old.
1934: THE THINGS THAT DID COME OFF
By The Marquess of Tavistock
Although the cold nights of late spring upset many of the early
breeding birds and the excessive heat and drought of summer
discouraged second nests, 1934 has been a fair average season for those
species not rare enough to invite the special attentions of " X ".

In the hope of increasing the supply of young birds for sale to meet
aviary expenses I had acquired a second pair of Pennant's from a
gentleman who had done a certain amount of exhibiting. Both birds,
in consequence, were very steady. The cock, as sometimes happens
with this rather variable species, has a certain amount of blue on the
lower breast but the marking is more curious than ornamental. I
provided a grandfather-clock nest in the open flight and the hen soon
took to it, but was so slow in settling down to actual business that
I feared she&amp;apos; was going to prove a dud and perhaps an egg-eater.
However, after hanging fire for several weeks, she really did start to sit
at the very end of May, her husband, -though not normally quite
fearless, becoming bellicose and showing a disposition to attack me.
All went well and at the end of July four young birds--two cocks and
two hens--left the nest, being similarly coloured in the " green phase 35
of young Pennant plumage with red on the cap, throat, flanks, and under
tail coverts. When one has had a few days to watch and compare them,
immature Pennant's can be sexed with certainty, the heavier and more
powerful heads and beaks of the cocks being noticeable even at that
early age. The hen Pennant &lt;got little help from her mate in the care of
the family once they were fledged, but she proved a devoted mother
and, though moulting herself, laboured on dutifully feeding her four
big children even when, had she been less unselfish, I am sure they
could perfectly well have fed themselves. According to my experience
the young of all the larger Broadtails, if they have the right food before
them, i.e. green food, soaked seed, and spray millet, will always start
to eat sooner than starve if deprived of parental aid at the time of
leaving the nest.
When the Pennant's were feeding young they were plentifully
supplied with sow thistle, groundsel, and knapweed. These valuable
foods are at their best in the green seed stage, i.e. when flowering is just
over. At this time groundsel and sow thistle begin to show white fluff
on the heads and the thistle-like flower of the knapweed or " hardheads "
turns from pinkish purple to brown. Aviculturalists whose supply
of green food is not unlimited should learn to gather what they have
at the stage when its feeding value is greatest. Weeds, grass, and green
oats carelessly gathered too soon when still only in bud and in flower

may be chewed up by the birds with an appearance of relish but the
amount they can actually find to swallow is negligible.
My second and original pair of Pennant's also did well this year.
Their success was rather unexpected as for the past two seasons only
two of their eggs have been fertile and the cock is certainly aged.
I was, indeed, intending to replace him by another but the substitute
proved a poor specimen and quite unsuitable, so I was obliged to try the
old bird once more. During the winter he flies loose but never goes
any distance from the aviaries. He had been kept as a cage bird for
many years by the owner of a public house in Wigan before he came
into my possession and his sojourn in that salubrious city has perma-
nently affected his character. Despite the fact that they have reared
many families together, I regret to say that the mutual regard existing
between him and his wife is of the most lukewarm character. She
would desert him instantly for a more eligible substitute if one presented
himself and he would not care two pins if she did ! He divides his time
at liberty between admiration of the Queen of Bavaria Conures, whom
I have even seen him try to feed ; flirtations with unattached hen
Broadtails ; and the exchange (from a safe distance) of back-chat with
rival couples of Platycerci in the aviaries. Being as big a coward
as he is a braggart he never tries conclusions with cock Broadtails, even
through wire netting, confining his attacks to their wives. The hen
Pennant of the other pair he particularly dislikes and it is evident that
she has said something about Wigan pubs that rankles deeply ! When
compelled to face domestic duties he is laziness personified, and I do not
blame his wife for her indifferent opinion of him. When he is first put
back in the aviary she is often master, and I believe she only gives
way to him at the finish, not because she has to, but because, in Broadtail
society, it is considered quite too impossibly incorrect for the husband
not to be ruler of his household ! It is, indeed, very amusing to watch
the way in which a big, powerful hen Broadtail who has fallen in love
with a much smaller and weaker male of another species will be most
careful, both out of consideration for his feelings and respect for the
conventions, to behave as though she were really rather in awe of him.
I have even seen a hen do this to a cock she had savagely bullied during
the time a more favoured lover was at hand but whom she decided she

would have to put up with as a pis alter when the favoured swain had
been sent away.
When the hen Pennant inspects the nest the old cock is far too lazy
to behave as a Broadtail gentleman should and skirmish about with an
appearance of great interest, waggling his tail. He justs sits comfort-
ably on the perch and gives a few whistles for her encouragement.
He is just as lazy when the children arrive and of late years I do not
believe he has fed anyone but himself. If a newly emerged nestling
flies clumsily from one end of the aviary to the other he flies up with it
and, having done that, he appears to consider that his duty as a father
has been adequately discharged ! This year a fine family of five have
been reared single-handed by the hen--two cocks and three hens.
The first to leave the nest--a hen--is almost entirely red, except on
the wings ; all have red breasts and the youngest member of the family
--a cock--is the most green.
My old pair of Crimson-wings laid four eggs and hatched and reared
three good young ones in a roomy natural tree-trunk in the open flight.
A new cock paired to a hen whose eggs with a hybrid cock have always
been infertile also helped to rear a good brood of three.
If you allow him the right kind of aviary and the right nest the
Crimson-wing is, in my opinion, the least trouble to manage and the
healthiest and hardiest of all the larger Parrakeets. Both young and
old keep far freer from chills and unforeseen ailments than any of the
Broadtails and they need less shelter and less " extras " in the way of
food when rearing young. A few boards in the flight, to provide shade
and protection from rain and direct wind from any quarter, are quite
sufficient and in a 24 X 8 X 8 ft. movable aviary with a turf bottom
it is unnecessary to give extra green food, apple and some seed thrown
down on a clean heap of peat to soften and sprout in the dew and rain
being all that are required.
The Crimson-wing's one drawback is the similarity of the sexes
until, it may be, the second complete moult, but young hens, well
reared, will lay at a year old and young cocks at the same age will often
show their sex by chuckling and calling, sotto voce , when at rest, in
a way hens do not do, since these only call when excited or on the move.

a good percentage of any clutch of eggs, this year established a record
by producing five young--two cocks and three hens. Young males,
I find, always show some " butterfly markings " on the wing even in
nestling plumage. It is a great pity that people will not do more with
this splendid Parrakeet as a liberty bird. When properly mated to hens
confined in aviaries adult males never stray and never get into trouble,
and their graceful flight and gorgeous colouring makes them highly
ornamental. They also possess the great advantage of agreeing when
at liberty with their own kind so that you can have as many cocks loose
as you choose to provide with hens and aviaries. At the moment
I have three flying in the garden and two have been out for part of
each season for years.
A pair of Mealy Rosellas which came last winter moulted some
weeks after arrival and began to show signs of being in breeding
condition soon after being turned into their aviary. The hen took
possession of a grandfather-clock nest and although at first she was
rather a nervous sitter she hatched and reared four fine youngsters.
The two young cocks have bright yellow caps with a few red and grey
feathers interspersed, while their sisters have grey caps much mottled
with brick red. It is often somewhat difficult to drive young Parrakeets
into the aviary shelter as the hole that leads to the shelter is a small
one. One of the young hen Mealies has proved the most tiresome and
obstinate pupil I have ever had to train. Young Barrabands, though
apt to lose their heads the first night and crash about in the most
alarming way, learn quickly and are rarely any trouble after the third
lesson. Not so the Mealy. She was almost as obstinate at the end of
the first week as on the first night, and it was the obstinacy of sheer
cussedness and not of timidity. I have been holding my arms above
my head for so long in my attempts to induce her to pass through into
the shelter that I am thinking of qualifying as an honorary fakir !
The success of the Yellow-bellies is recorded in a separate article.
The brood--again two pairs--are the finest and strongest young Broad-
tails I have ever reared. Last autumn I obtained for the first time in
my life a true pair of Yellow-mantled Rosellas, my previous Yellow-
mantles all being cocks. The hen, I was interested to discover, is
quite as decidedly yellow on the mantle as her mate, but in other

respects she differs as a hen Rosella of the common race would do,
having the characteristic greenish feathers behind the eye which are
the best guide to sex in mature birds. The pair were excessively wild,
always dashing into the shelter when anyone walked along the front of
the aviary. As often happens, however, their timidity did not prevent
them from proving good breeders. The hen, after some delay, took
possession of a hollow perpendicular tree-trunk and in due course
reared six lovely youngsters, I think two cocks and four hens. They
are decidedly yellower in first plumage than young common
Rosellas of the same age.
Plumheads also nested in a natural tree-trunk and had four eggs,
rearing one young bird. An undoubted young cock I bred three years
ago is again moulting out with a grey head, showing that the plum
colour may not appear with the second complete moult. Strange to
say a Slaty-head X Plumhead hybrid I sent to Mr. Whitley is
showing signs of adult plumage with his first complete moult, like a
Malabar.
Rock Peplars again nested in the rather unsuitable coco-nut husk
box that is the only domicile the hen will consent to patronize. They
hatched three young and reared two, or rather two were reared, for
they proved lazy feeders and so neglected their younger child that we
had to bring her in for some days and feed her on chewed seed, pea-nuts,
and brown bread until she learned to eat seed for herself.
Barrabands did not have a good season. The eggs hatched well
but the bitter nights in late spring accounted for many nestlings and
two pairs reared only one daughter each and the third pair two sons.
Next year I shall not allow them to start before 15th May. Roseate
Cockatoos, a white cock and a pale grey hen, after wasting several
seasons, reared two young in 1932 and two in 1933. This year they
seemed disposed to return to their former evil habits, for the hen laid
an egg from the perch and broke it when it was placed in the nest.
Later the pair appeared to be sitting in earnest but after a while they
gave up and the eggs, if any, proved to have vanished. I then
abandoned all hope but, contrary to expectations, the hen made a
third attempt and the young are now nearly ready to fly.
Unhappily the breeding of white Roseates promises to be as long

a road as the breeding of lutino Ring-necks, which took me twenty
years to accomplish ! One of my 1932 cocks, paired to a breeding hen
at Keston, proved a persistent egg eater, and as cock Roseates have to
sit, as well as their mates, an eg*g-eating cock is as hopeless as an
egg-eating hen for breeding.
My 1933 birds proved a pair. After wintering them indoors
I turned them into an aviary, but the prospect of white Roseates
being bred in 1935 so incensed " X " that he made a dead set at the
unfortunate young couple, sending illness after illness upon them until
I abandoned all hope of getting them to live out of doors this year.
Even so he was not satisfied, and finished off the cock in the bird-room
with a dose of bacillus coli, the hen being only saved after weeks of
illness and careful nursing.

By The Marquess of Tavistock
This large Tasmanian Broadtail has been imported not infrequently
during the last twenty years, but with the exception of Mr. Whitley,
who has had two cocks for a considerable period and bred some hybrids,
few people in England, I fancy, have been very successful in preserving
it for any great length of time. The fact is that the Yellow-belly is not
as well suited to the type of aviary most commonly used. Rather
intolerant of heat and very intolerant of stale ground and subject to
septicaemia, small fixed aviaries do not agree with it at all and it
was only when I began using 24 X 8 X 8 ft. movable aviaries that
my birds began to live a respectable time. Another reason for making
use of movable aviaries is the Yellow-belly's great fondness for green
food. No Broadtail needs or appreciates a larger amount or a greater
variety, and fresh branches should also be supplied regularly throughout
the year. Most individuals acquire a taste for meal-worms and the
staple diet should consist of canary, millet, oats, sunflower, and pea-nuts,
together with apple. Much hemp is liable to induce feather-plucking :
I once had a cock who was rendered so bad a feather-plucker by an

excess of hemp that six months of complete liberty on wild food, only,
failed to cure him ! He recovered, however, during the next moult.
In size the Yellow-bellied Parrakeet is fully as large as the Pennant.
The upper parts of the body are olive green with darker markings and
there is some blue in the wings and tail. Part of the head and neck
and the entire breast are lemon yellow, sometimes pure, sometimes
tinged with olive green or streaked with orange. A cock Yellow-belly
whose breast-colour is clear is a very handsome, though not gaudy
bird. The most beautiful specimen I ever owned was bred by
Monsieur Decoux, whose success in rearing this Parrakeet has never
been approached by any other aviculturalist. The cheek patches are
blue, as in Pennant's Parrakeet, and there is a red frontal band. Hens
are very similar in colour to cocks but their heads and beaks are so
much smaller that they are easy to sex. Young birds in first plumage
differ from the adult in having the breast dark olive green with only
a slight trace of yellow on the cheeks and throat. The dark markings
on the wings are also greener and are less pronounced. The bill is the
same fleshy horn colour seen in young Pennant's.
The commonest call-note of the Yellow-bellied Parrakeet resembles
the word " Kossuk " ! In addition each bird normally possesses one or
two liquid whistling notes or phrases in the character of which there
is much individual variation, as is usual with other members of the
family. My hen has learned the whistle of a former husband but rarely
uses it when in the company of a mate.
This lady has been in my possession nearly twelve years, but on
only one previous occasion--i.e. in 1932--has she laid. For some reason,
poor thing, she does not appear to captivate the heart of the opposite
sex ! Not being a cock Yellow-belly, I cannot say exactly why she
fails to charm, but until recently it is a sad fact that more than one
gentleman has either been mildly bored by her or actuated by a feeling
of downright contempt. One cock I had with her at Warblington
tolerated her and very occasionally fed her, but it was evident that she
had no real place in his heart. When at liberty, instead of coming to
see her at frequent intervals as a well-behaved Broadtail husband
should do, he rarely went near her aviary and turned a deaf ear to her
lonely whistles. Throughout the&amp;apos; winter he led a wandering existence,

often straying miles from home and not putting in an appearance for
weeks at a time, for he appeared well able to support himself even in
weather when our native birds were starving. In spring, however,
he never failed to return, not, sad to say, to revisit his deserted spouse,
but with the object of killing a certain Yellow-rumped Parrakeet.
Why he detested this particular bird more than any other cock Broadtail
in the collection and why he only wanted to see him dead in May (for
he ignored him at other times) was known only to himself, but by using
the object of his dislike as a decoy his recapture was easy and he then
spent a bored and idle summer with his unappreciated lady. Finally
his wandering habits proved his downfall. He was shot by a farmer
in mistake for a Hawk.
His successor was the young bird already referred to as having been
bred by our French member. Lovely bird as he was when in adult
plumage, his domestic virtues were nil. He never tried to be even
passably civil to the hen. When the nest-box was put in he was
interested enough, but if she ever came to look at it, too, instead of
making way for her politely as every well-mannered cock Broadtail
should do, he drove her away and went on looking at it himself. One
day he attacked her savagely and pulled out a lot of her feathers, so
that when they were reunited his wing had to be cut. That year the
hen came into breeding condition late and laid four eggs in July, but
the cock had started to moult and took not the slightest interest in the
proceedings. After two years I got tired of him and decided to replace
him by a bird whose manners left less to be desired. It was arranged
that he should be sent abroad but he had other intentions, for he
managed to make his escape while being boxed and, unless someone
has shot him, he is probably wandering about England to this day !
Inquiries for another cock for a time proved unsuccessful, but
when visiting the last Palace Show my eye fell on a nice Yellow-belly

anyhow ! It is true that later in the spring he did one day start driving
her a bit and had to have his wing tipped, but I do not think he really
meant to hurt her, but only wished to impress upon her that it was
time she settled down to business. She certainly was a very slow
starter ; though provided with the tall, bark-topped grandfather-clock
nest in the open flight she had patronized two years previously, she
seemed unable to get as far as her first egg. She let the cock feed her
in May and sometimes spent a lot of time in the nest, but when I left
home on the last day of the month her visits to the box were less
frequent than they had been and an ominous dropped tail-feather
from the cock heralded the onset of the moult. However, at the end
of June she did produce four eggs and her mate half-delayed his moult
in order to be able to attend to family affairs. In due course the four
eggs hatched and by the beginning of the second week in August gentle
pipings and sounds of scrambling inside the nest announced the early
exit of the family. On 12th August a fine strong youngster made its
appearance, to be, if it should survive, the first pure-bred Yellow-belly
to be reared in England.
While the young were being fed the old birds were plentifully
supplied with groundsel, sow thistle, and " hardheads The latter
plant, rather like a spine-less thistle in appearance and exceedingly
common in late summer, is a most valuable food for the larger Broad-
tails. The seed-heads are most appreciated when the pinkish purple
flower has died and turned brown. The two old birds seem very devoted
to their offspring and very solicitous for their welfare. The hen does
most of the feeding of the young while in the nest but the cock, though
moulting, feeds her and also feeds the young one that has emerged.
Twelve years is a long time to wait for a bird to start nesting, but now;
that she has succeeded once I hope the hen will continue and take her
place in the honourable company of regular breeders. Certainly there
is something about her now far more matronly and domestic than there
used to be and the meagre, old-maid air of former seasons has departed !
The young birds did well and are now independent of the parents.

A pair of California Mourning Doves were contentedly rearing
their young in a spacious outdoor aviary quite early this spring.
Besides Galapagos, Bronze-wing, and other kinds of foreign Doves
and Pigeons, its population included a single White Dove. A female
it was--rather small, tidy, and gentle. She paid very little attention
to any of the other occupants, all of which were mated. For several
months she lived thus quietly and to herself.
The Mourning Doves were on their second setting of eggs. One
morning early, while the female was still on the nest, I saw her mate,
the heartless philanderer, fly over to where the demure White Dove
was basking in the sunshine. At first she disregarded him entirely,
remaining stock-still. Then the flirt flew to a near by branch, spreading
his tail feathers in view of the silent and wholly undemonstrative
White Dove, and each time folding his wings with particular and
gentle grace. This wooing he repeated half a dozen times. Each
time he alighted on the branch on which his newly found friend was
perched, she would look up slightly startled. Finally, when
Mr. Mourning Dove, whose shameless philanderings were watched
with silent disgust by his wife on the nest, perched dangerously near
the White Dove, she made off to another branch. Apparently that
was just what he had wanted right along, for now he followed her
from branch to branch in dexterous flight, and always with widespread
tail. Just the same, when it came time to do his share of the incubating,
about 10 o'clock, he relieved his mate with faithful regularity, remaining
on the nest until after four o'clock--as any good male Dove should.
In due time the two eggs hatched, so that Mr. Mourning Dove had
less time to indulge in his love affair. His mate in the meantime had
become so jealous that she chased her hated white rival whenever the
latter showed up in the vicinity of the nest. During the next three
weeks, while the young Mourning Doves were rapidly growing, I saw
their father frequently in the company of the White Dove, who by this
time was responding whole-heartedly to his advances.
As soon as the young Mourning Doves knew how to get their own

food and water, I liberated their mother. She flew straightway to
the near by mountains--glad no doubt to be rid of her fickle and
faithless mate. Though this was more than three months ago, she
has not, so far as I know, returned once to her old home and her offspring.
Shortly after her departure, the newly mated pair built a very trim
little nest of twigs, lined with dry leaves and bits of dry moss. Twice
the White Dove laid eggs. Though she and her mate brooded regularly,
there were no young either time owing to infertility. When she laid
a third time, however, one egg hatched. Carefully the youngster
was nursed, the male being on the nest practically the entire day to
keep him warm, thus doing more than his usual share. For some
unknown reason he seems more attached to this particular youngster.
Maybe it is because he is the offspring of a wife than which he never
had a more beautiful one. Whereas she would fly off the nest almost
the moment I approached it, he would remain always, scolding me and
ready to strike me with beak and wing. The youngster has just flown
out of the nest. It is a handsome, strong bird somewhat larger than
either a young Mourning or a young White Dove, and somewhat lighter
in colour than the former. The hybrid is as pugnacious as its father,
shown by his fighting pose in one of the accompanying pictures, in
which he looks more like a fluffy young Owl than a young Dove. In
the meantime his parents are preparing to nest once more, and the
adventure in breeding these rather unique crosses continues.

These notes were commenced as a letter to our editor recording the
rather unusual circumstances under which I had reared two Diamond
Sparrows. It then occurred to me that, though they refer to no very
rare or remarkable birds, some early breeding records might be of
interest to members whose avicultural activities are likewise restricted
by considerations of time, space, and expense. At present my small

aviaries contain only foreign hardbills, so these notes are only qualified
to interest those whose activities lie in the same direction.
Here is the story of the two Diamond Sparrows, now about to fly
from the third nest in which they have already passed part of their
brief span of life. Having occasion to return home for a day in the
middle of my holiday, I found a deserted nest of what I thought to be
Diamond Sparrow eggs, the parents having, Zebra like, deserted them
in favour of.another site, where they were then incubating. As the
three eggs seemed fairly fresh I looked about for a foster parent, but
could only find a hen canary which had already reared a number of
Goldfinch mules and was now supposed to be paired with a Hooded
Siskin mule. Though the said hen seemed more likely to moult than
complete the incubation period, it was a case of " Hobson's choice ",
so I left her to it and, on returning home during the first week of
September, was surprised to find three day-old Sparrow chicks. I doubt
if she could have reared them but, as it happened, the question never
arose since, that particular aviary being seldom used and possessing
no safety door, the hen slipped out and, strangely enough, never
returned, leaving me to search for yet another foster for the
orphans--now two or three days old. Apart from Zebras, of which
I am always suspicious as foster parents, the only available repository
was a Bengalese nest from which, on my mid-holiday visit, I had removed
all but seven of the twenty or so eggs it then contained. It now held
one partly fledged Bengalee and one naked youngster of, apparently,
about a week old. Having, with the aid of the invaluable teaspoon,
extracted the minute Diamond Sparrows from their first nest and
presented them to the Bengalese, I visited the nest a few days later
with the intention of removing their corpses, only to find all four
birds well on the way to the independence one has already attained.
Though, no doubt, many others could record similar experiences,
I think this is worth mentioning as further proof of the value of
Bengalese as foster parents, and of the wisdom of approaching all
similar problems in the spirit of that friend of our childhood, Robert
Bruce.
While writing of unusual breeding experiences, I wonder if any other
member has found both cock and hen Diamond Dove each incubating

two eggs in separate nests ? As there were no other adult birds in that
aviary, I presume the cock must have taken over the responsibility for
the nest deserted by the hen, but as I found her sitting on the more
developed embryos, while those under the cock appeared quite clear,
I am rather at a loss to understand how they managed it, and, although
this enterprising effort at mass production seemed to have little prospect
of success in the case of Doves, I am now rather sorry I didn't let them
complete it, instead of removing the eggs from the cock, who then,
dove like, did his best to prevent the hen from completing the
incubation of her two eggs. Ultimately, however, they settled down
to a normal division of labour.
To date (18th September) I have reared nineteen young Diamond
Doves from two pair, the first young being hatched in February, and
eleven young from one pair of Peaceful Doves. I have found the
latter not only very prolific but much less trouble to breed than
Diamonds, since they are less liable to try and destroy their young
on commencing another nest. In fact, I have repeatedly had young
Peaceful flying with the parents while the latter were rearing the next
pair--a practice seldom or never possible in the 4 case of Diamond Doves.
This is the third season I have had these doves breeding at this rate and,
so far, I have found no ill effects revealed in either parents or young.
I am convinced that a liberal use of maw seed is one of the secrets of
success in breeding these two species of Dove, and I am now trying
it with Pigmys as well. In view of the considerable importations of
Diamond Doves, it is both surprising and unfortunate that the more
reliable and steadier Peaceful Doves should be so difficult to obtain.
They are a beautiful species which, in my experience, are much more
" peaceful " than other of the. Dove family both in relation to their
own and other species ; one of the pairs referred to above having reared
most of their young in the same aviary as a breeding pair of Diamonds.
My own aviary-bred Peacefuls have just started breeding, paired
to imported adults I was able to secure through the kindness of one of
our members--Mon. Decoux, of Gery, Aixe-Sur-Vienne.
Bicheno Finches have done very well here this season, one pair
having reared six young from three nests. Much the same applies to
Olive Finches, now rearing their third brood. In connection with the

award of tlie Foreign Bird League breeder's medal tbe question has
arisen whether these are Olive Finches (Phonipara lepida ) or Little
Finches ( P . pusilla), and I should be grateful for information on this
point from anyone who has had experience of both species and sub-
species. Cuban Finches have also been very satisfactory.
Through a series of unfortunate accidents (two due to the inadvertent
use of sheeps' wool as nesting material, as a result of which two sitting
hens had their legs dislocated) I have had no success this season with
either Hecks or ordinary Longtailed G-rassfinches, but I have a pair
of the now rare Parson Finches incubating steadily, and am hoping
to build up a stock of these interesting and beautiful little birds, the
importation of which seems, unaccountably, to have stopped. Last
season I reared fifty-one young from two pair of Zebra Finches but, this
year, the average from ten pair in an aviary to themselves has been much
lower. I attribute this partly to the upsetting effect of a number of
young birds on the breeding pairs, and partly to the fact that at least
half the total number were 1933 birds. In my experience these agile
and aggravating little finches need to be at least two years old before
they can be relied upon as steady breeders. I find that, when a
considerable number of pairs are housed in the same aviary, the young
are not hatched and reared consecutively but in batches. This is due
to the fact, already referred to, that a number of young birds in an
aviary bring all nesting operations to a standstill by their indiscriminate
use of nest-boxes as night nurseries, and this practical difficulty leads
me to believe that, though the species is most prolific when their
gregarious nature can be gratified, the best results will generally
be obtained when the numbers of breeding pairs in any one aviary
is kept within manageable dimensions, and the young from each nest
removed immediately they are independent, that is when they have
been ten or twelve days out of the nest.
Of my present collection of hardbills Bed-headed Parrot Finches
have been the most satisfactory, one pair having reared all the young
from five eggs and, immediately they were independent, started to
repeat the process in the same nest with three eggs. If only someone
could discover a reliable method of sexing them, these most active,
beautiful, prolific, and exceptionally hardy little birds would be ideal

for an aviary, and I hope a supply of aviary-bred Parrot Finches will
soon be available to bring the species within the reach of those who
hesitate to secure imported (and generally half-naked) specimens at
the present price of from ten to twelve pounds a pair.
Desertion, due to the hen starting to moult, denied me the privilege
of being, possibly the first, and certainly the second breeder in the
British Isles of Black Seed Finches (Melophyrrha nigra), two young
being almost feathered when the parents ceased to feed them. As this
species is very hardy, and my pair were feeding their young largely
on the invaluable milksop--the use of which generally means successful
rearing--I have good hopes of rearing some of these rather rare and
interesting birds next season. I would be interested to know on what
authority this species is referred to as " Cuban Bullfinches ". The facts
that they seen to belong to that genus, and do come from Cuba, is hardly
sufficient reason for giving them a name which seems to have no
scientific authority whatever.
As the other species now in my aviaries are either of no particular
interest or have failed to breed, I will not usurp any more space in
referring to them here.

TERNS OR SEA SWALLOWS

Those of us who love to watch and study our less common British
Birds in their natural haunts, have a very soft spot in their hearts
for the Terns or Sea Swallows, those most elegant and charming of our
sea birds, which, like the true Swallows, pass the spring and summer
months only in our islands, journeying away in the autumn to far
distant southern shores. There is no more delightful experience than
that afforded by a visit in May or June to the summer home of the
Terns, where one has to tread with the greatest care lest one should
crush the eggs or fluffy newly-hatched young, while overhead the air
is full of wheeling, scolding Terns. Over the near-by sea they are also
gliding, ever watchful of the surface of the water, and every now and

then dropping with a plunge into the depths and quickly returning
to the air with a prize of a tiny fish. In the spring and autumn, if we
are lucky, we may see the pretty Black Tern as it pays a brief visit
to our lakes and broads where once its ancestors reared their broods.
Thanks to the protection afforded them nowadays we still have five
species of Terns which condescend to make their summer homes and
rear their families with us, and some of us have been fortunate enough
to see some at least of these. And surely those of us who have obtained
a partial knowledge of these lovely creatures wish to know more about
them, and we have every opportunity to do so now if we carefully read
Sea Terns and Sea Swallows. 1 Mr. and Mrs. George Marples have spent
years in the study of our British Terns, and I suppose no one knows
more about them than they do, and moreover they are skilled photo-
graphers and have accumulated a wonderful collection of studies of these
birds, pictures which are unrivalled in excellence, though I suppose
few birds have been more photographed than the Terns, whose elegant
form invites the work of the artist. In this new book we have been
given the rare treat of learning much of the life habits of these lovely
creatures, for it is the best monograph on the group that has appeared,
and records many facts connected with their lives that were not known
before these two naturalists undertook their intensive studies.

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
A SUGGESTION
Unfortunately aviculturists cannot avoid death of their birds ; death
from disease can, to a certain extent, and should, be prevented, but not
death from old age. What becomes of the corpse ? Is it decently (or other-
wise) interred in a quiet corner of the garden, or are the rites and ceremonies
of cremation duly and faithfully carried out ? Is there not another and
better way to dispose of the body ? Perhaps there is.
Have our members considered the preparation and mounting of the
skins, and the presentation of same to their local schools. It would not
take long for a decent little museum to be built up in many schools. What
a wonderful natural history and geography lesson this could become for
the children, but above all, think how this would inculcate in each tender
mind a love of the beautiful, and how this love could create a desire to own

and care for feathered pets. This early training should be of incalculable
benefit to the future of our hobby by enlarging the number of its adherents
and creating, through knowledge, a spirit of tolerance and inquiry.
For a start, will our members give this suggestion a trial, and in order
that the effectiveness of the scheme may be studied by the Council of the
Society, may I make a further suggestion that for the present this scheme
be tried in a few schools only, and if proved successful then each aviculturist
supports the schools in his own district.
Our members have the valuable material to form the nucleus of the
collection, and it is up to us to make the best use of same.

well, and a badly mounted specimen is almost worse than none at all.-- Ed.]

STOCK DOVE x DOMESTIC PIGEON HYBRIDS

Scottish Blue Pigeon (nearest to Blue Rock with almost \ in. black bars).
The first pair were starved as the perch fell down from the hole where the hen

the hen reared the youngster, but it was faulty on its legs, so I killed it. The
Stock Dove wing pattern is absolutely dominant, and the two broad bars,
so characteristic of the male parent, are non-existent, quite contrary to
expectations.
I hope to try it with a " checker " next year. The hen is quite a good
bird (Stock Doves and Wood Pigeons, i.e. true wild Quests, hand-reared, go
absolutely mad unless kept tame and in fairly closed places for about six
to eight months). A friend tells me he has put a number of Stock Dove and
Quests' eggs under his racers, and the young rarely survive ten days. Probably
these young Pigeons require the food of the " wild " for ready development.

our member who gave me the information may have something to say in

I must say I still think that the number of Masked Parrakeets taken was
unnecessary and excessive.
In regard to obtaining material for museums from birds bred in captivity,
it is a common error of ornithologists who are not aviculturists to suppose
that birds reared in confinement at once show such aberrations and
abnormalities as to render them useless for purposes of scientific study. As
a matter of fact, it takes several generations of captivity breeding before the
slightest variation from the wild type begins, and an immensely long period
before the original type is swamped and lost by the domestic variations.

NOTES ON THE CYANORHAMPHUS

The Cyanorhamphus Parrakeets form a very distinct genus and
are confined to the New Zealand region ; though some members are
found on far distant islands which are no doubt the last remaining
outposts of some vast continent which was submerged beneath the
Southern Pacific Ocean many eons ago.
These Parrakeets vary in size from slightly larger than a Budgerigar,
in the case of the New Zealand Alpine Parrakeet ( Cyanorhamphus
malherbei), to as large as a Pennant in Cyanorham&amp;apos;phus cooki from
Norfolk Island, which is the largest of the genus.
In colour they are not particularly striking, being more or less of
a uniform grass green marked with either red or yellow, and blue. These
Parrakeets are remarkable for the fact that they inhabit regions far
from the tropics and several species are confined to desolate, bleak,
and often treeless islands, where the species have become, owing to
the absence of trees, practically terrestrial.
Unfortunately civilized man has dealt very hardly with these birds
and several species are now extinct ; others are on the verge of
extermination, while none are in a flourishing condition. The two
commonest species, which were confined to the mainland and which were
found in great abundance before the advent of the white man to the

shores of New Zealand, are now greatly reduced in numbers and are
found only in the most remote forested districts as well as on several
of the islands off the coast.
The two species mentioned, the Red-fronted Parrakeets and the
Yellow-fronted Parrakeets, were very well known to British aviculturists
forty or more years ago, and were bred with comparative ease in the
aviaries of several bird-keepers. But it was the same with these as with
any other bird which was comparatively easy to obtain, people did
not bother to breed them and they just died out. Now these interesting
species will never grace our aviaries again.
The Antipodes Island Parrakeet [Cyanorhamphus unicolor)
This unique Parrakeet is confined to a tiny island far distant from
New Zealand, and well on the way to the chill Antarctic Ocean. Very
few specimens have been brought away alive. Buffer, the great New
Zealand naturalist, had several; the Zoological Society had one or two
many years ago ; in fact, the type was described from a bird in the
possession of the Society, the habitat of which was then unknown, and
recently the Marquess of Tavistock possessed a single example. This
bird, which is doubtless the last which will ever reach these shores,,
was procured by a sailor from a small ship which stopped at the island.
The bird was knocked over with a stick by the man on the shore, which
shows how fearless this species is in a wild state.
I had great hopes of visiting the lonely island which forms the homo
of this strange Parrakeet, for I thought that I might be able to get
as a passenger on the small Government steamer which once a year
visits the islands in the far south in search of castaways and also to
replenish the food store on the islands which is kept in case any
unfortunate individuals get shipwrecked there. But, alas ! I found
out from the High Commissioner in London that, owing to means of
economy, the steamer no longer visited the islands in the borders of
the Antarctic, and the would-be castaways are now left to their fate !
Every inquiry possible was made, and I found that the only means
of getting there was to charter a special ship, which would have to be of
a large tonnage owing to the tempestuous seas. The price asked was-

#500, which, needless to say, was quite beyond my means, so
I reluctantly had to give up the project.
I very much regret to say that I fear the numbers of this bird have
been greatly reduced by the members of a certain American expedition
which has been ravaging the islands of the Pacific for several years and
almost wiping out whole species of birds. This expedition collected
many skins of this species, and from what I heard of the brutal slaughter
by the members of the expedition of this isolated type its fate is certainly
in the balance.
The death knell of various rare island species is certainly sounded
when such expeditions as these pursue their depredations unchecked.
Instead of assisting ornithological research they appear to be hampering
it, at least for future generations. They have left such a name behind
them that they will never be allowed to collect again in many of the
British Islands, especially New Zealand.
During my visit to Stewart Island and the outlying islands I saw
something of the terrible seas of those parts, and it is little wonder
that few ships ever call at the bleak islands in the far south. The
great marvel is that a Parrot has been able to adapt itself to such severe
conditions as prevail on the island on which it is found. As mentioned
before, it is very unlikely that the bird will ever be seen alive again by
aviculturists in Europe, for with the stopping of the Government
steamer and the total closing of the seal-killing season there is no reason
for any ship to brave the terrible gales which rage in those seas.
The Antipodes Island Parrakeet is completely terrestrial and lives
on the ground amongst the tussock grass, feeding upon the seeds of the
grass. The very boisterous winds have made flight almost impossible
for this bird, and it is very feeble on the wing, though it can run and
climb about the rocks with the greatest agility.
W. R. B. Oliver, who has seen the bird in its native haunts, tells us
in his book New Zealand Birds that this Parrakeet " is a ground bird
which walks and climbs but seldom takes wing. It is found among the
tussocks and scrub and also on the rocks along the shore, including the
breeding places of the Penguins. It is quite fearless and makes a low
chattering sound as it walks about. It breeds in holes in the thick
matted bases of the grass tussocks ",

276. Sydney Porter--Notes on the Cyanorhamyhus Parrakeets
A short description of the home of this unique bird may be of
interest, and the following is an extract from a letter from the High
Commissioner of New Zealand in London : " The Antipodes Islands
lie : some 490 miles east-south-east from the southernmost point of
Stewart Island. . . . The largest island is known as Antipodes Island,
and measures 4 miles from east to west and 2 miles from north to south.
At its highest point it reaches an elevation of 1,300 feet. The coast is
rocky and precipitous, with steep slopes covered with tussock rising
from the tops of the cliffs to the high land in the centre of the island.
... The tussock grows from 4 to 6 feet in height in many parts and
so close together that it is a matter of difficulty to force one's way
through it. There are no trees on the island, but some patches of shrubs,
particularly in the shallow gullies, where rank growth of fern are also
found. In addition to the various seabirds which nest there, the island
is noted for a small Green Parrakeet, which is found fairly plentifully
amongst the tussock grass."
The weather on this isolated island is far from ideal, terrible gales
and storms sweep over it in the winter time from the Antarctic and
make it anything but a desirable place for a Parrakeet to live on. But
in spite of this it seems to have been able to fight the elements and hold
its own until the coming of the arch-enemy of all feather life, Man,
who seems to have made short work with this highly specialized and
interesting species. The Antipodes Island Parrakeet is about 14 inches
in length and of a uniform yellowish grass-green, with the primary
coverts and the outer edges of the primaries bright blue. The legs are
particularly long and eminently suited for the terrestrial life which the
bird leads.
Some of these birds were transferred to Kapiti Island in 1907,
but there were none there when I visited it. Highly specialized animals
hardly ever thrive when transferred from their own habitat to another.
There is certainly no tussock on Kapiti on which the birds could feed.
Buller says : " My captive birds seemed perfectly happy although
caged when adult. They partook freely of maize and oats, also of apples,
grapes, figs, and, indeed, ripe fruit of any kind. They could bite
severely, as I soon learned to my cost. . . . Although captured as adult
birds they readily take to confinement and do not fret, as most other

birds do, at being caged. I have noticed that this species has a habit of
resting at night in an upright position, holding on to the wires of its
cage by both bill and feet."
The Macquarie Island Parrakeet (Cyanorhamphus n. erythrotis)
Macquarie Island will no doubt be better known to readers as the
original " Penguin Island ". It is one of those tiny islands which lie far
off the coast of New Zealand and well on the way to the Antarctic.
It was until recently the scene of the most terrible and disgusting
slaughter of the Penguins, when every year tens of thousands of these
hapless birds were driven into great vats or digesters to be boiled down
alive for the sake of a cheap commercial oil used mainly for the greasing
of ropes, as it was a trifle less in cost than mineral oil. On this island
lived a small Parrakeet of the Cyanorhamphus group, a bird like the
Antipodes Island Parrakeet, which was particularly terrestrial in its
habits, more from force of circumstances than anything else, as there
are no trees on the island, it being too bleak and wind-swept.
This Parrakeet, like the last, derived its sustenance from the seeds
of the tussock grass and also nested under the clumps of the same grass.
A scientific expedition which called at this island within recent years
failed to find the bird at all. One of the party who had explored
the island told me that though they examined every part of it they
failed to find the bird, so had reluctantly to come to the conclusion
that it was extinct.
Some time afterwards I met one of the professional Penguin killers
from Macquarie Island, and he told me that the Parrakeet had
disappeared prior to his advent there some years before the War. There
is little doubt that this bird was exterminated through the agency
of cats, which were brought by the Penguin killers in the very early
days and which were left to fend for themselves when the men left in
the winter. These animals have greatly increased and still take a great
toll of the bird life. The Macquarie Island Parrakeet is similar to the
Red-fronted Parrakeet, but is of a more yellowish green, especially on
the under parts, and there is very little blue on the wings.

There is no doubt that in the course of time both this bird and its
ally, the Yellow-fronted Parrakeet, will vanish from the mainland of
New Zealand. Fortunately it will not vanish from the face of the earth
so long as the New Zealand Government still retain the Little Barrier
Island, Kapiti Island, and the islands off Stewart Island as sanctuaries
for New Zealand's much persecuted bird life. On these islands the birds
are numerous, especially the Bed-fronted. The latter birds are also
extremely common on some more very small islands, the names of
which had perhaps better not be mentioned.
Once exceedingly common, the Eed-fronted Parrakeets were to be
seen in flocks of thousands ; now on the mainland they are restricted to
a few very remote localities. On my arrival in New Zealand I spent
a considerable time in searching for these birds, and at last tracked
down a small colony in the forest reserve of Lake Waikaremoana. In
every other locality I was told that the Parrakeets were very plentiful
forty years or more ago, but had now quite disappeared and were now
never seen.
Like most of New Zealand's birds, it is dependent on the forests for
its food, and it is intolerant of any interference on the part of man.
For wherever timber-felling operations are started prior to the burning
of the forest, the birds quickly disappear. Many years ago Parrot
shooting was a favourite " sport " with the colonists, and this no doubt
helped to reduce the numerical strength of the birds to a great degree.
This Parrakeet is very rarely kept in captivity in New Zealand now.
When I was first in New Zealand I did hear of one, but when I tracked
it down it proved to be a White Cockatoo ! We shall never see this
interesting species in our aviaries again, except perhaps an odd one or
two now and again which happens to be smuggled out of the country,
for the New Zealand Government would rather see fifty perish in a forest
fire than a single pair leave the country for breeding purposes.
To show the great rarity of this bird on the mainland, many people
who were interested in birds had never seen it and most ordinary
people had never even heard of it. The birds which I did manage to see
on the mainland were exceedingly timid and it was impossible to get
within a good many hundred yards of them, except once in the forest

at Takahue, when one alighted near to us, but as soon as it became
aware of our presence it was off like a shot from a gun.
On the Little Barrier Island this Parrakeet finds sanctuary and it is
extremely common ; in fact, I should think that the Parrot population
of the Little Barrier is greater than that of the entire mainland. On
first setting foot on that fascinating island the Parrakeets were the first
birds which attracted our attention. What a joy it was to see these
brightly coloured birds only a few feet away instead of a quarter of
a mile away as I had done on the mainland ! Here they were utterly
fearless, and my first " birdy " thrill after landing was to see one of
these birds only a few feet away feeding on the seeds of the native
flax which grew on the beach.
The favourite diet of the Parrakeets is the seeds of this plant
( Phormium ), known locally as " flax ", but bears no resemblance
to the plant known as flax in Europe. The seed pods are like
small hard bananas and are borne in clusters in a candelabra-
like fashion on stems which grow from 10 to 15 feet high. Each
pod is packed with peculiar flattened black seeds, the kernel of
which in the centre is white and nut-like to the taste. By the time the
pods are ripe one finds that nearly all have been torn to pieces by the
Parrakeets. On the Little Barrier I endeavoured to procure a quantity
of these seeds for my Norfolk Island Parrakeets, which would also
doubtless feed on them, since the plant is found on Norfolk Island.
As all the seeds were eaten as soon as they ripened by the Parrakeets,
I plucked a huge stock of the partly ripe seed pods and placed them
under bushes covered with branches of trees, hoping that they would
ripen in that way. But on arriving at my treasure store some days later
to collect the seed I found that I had been outwitted by the Parrakeets,
who had discovered my hoard and systematically opened every pod.
Around the caretaker's house on the island the birds were com-
paratively tame, coming down to feed on the various seeds in the garden
and also on the apples which they seemed to relish in a half-ripe state.
It was when in the apple trees that we were able to approach nearest
to the birds, usually within two or three yards.
On a small group of islands which we visited we found the Parrakeets
very plentiful; on one of the very smallest islands they were especially

numerous. These islands are very small, and although they were covered
with the densest vegetation it was amazing that they supported such
a large Parrot population. Most of the islands were almost inaccessible
except the one where the Parrakeets were so plentiful, and access to
this was only gained through climbing up a precipitous and partly
dried-up waterfall. During the rainy season it would be quite impossible
to gain access to this island at all. It is doubtless the inaccessibility of
these islands which has saved the Parrakeets.
The season had been very dry and there were only one or two small
pools on rocky ledges, and these formed the sole drinking places for the
birds on the island. All manner of native birds were perfectly tame ;
the Parrakeets came round and settled within a foot or two of one ; in
fact, they seemed to ignore the presence of human beings, treating us
as though we were non-existent. I have seen few birds as tame
in a wild state as the Parrakeets on this island. A professional bird-
catcher could have caught hundreds in a morning. I spent two days
and one night there, sleeping under the shelter of a huge " flax " plant
on the beach so that I could observe the habits of the birds at their
drinking places early in the morning. In this I was disappointed, for
I found that the best time for seeing the Parrakeets was in the heat of
the day, when there was a constant stream of them coming to drink
and bathe. It was on this island that I heard for the first time the very
distinctive goat-like bleat of these birds which caused the Germans to
call this species " Ziegensittich ". At first I though there must be
numerous kids in the " bush 55 as there are on many of the small islands
off the coast, but I soon found out the noise was made by the
Parrakeets.
On the first three of the chain of islands which we visited the " flax "
plants were entirely stripped of their seeds, and on these islands the
Parrakeets were not nearly as plentiful as on the last island, where
there was still a large quantity of seed, so it is obvious that the birds
pass from one island to another as the supply of seed runs short. There
must be a considerable shortage of seed in the winter time, for I cannot
think what the birds would eat except the hard seeds of a pampas-like
grass called in the vernacular " toi-toi
I spent a good many hours watching the Parrakeets at their drinking

place and noticed that some of the birds seemed to prefer to settle on
the perpendicular rocks and suck up the moisture which oozed through
the cracks. I noted, too, that the birds were extremely agile in their
movements on the rocks, running up perpendicular faces with the
utmost ease.
On another fairly large island some miles away from the small group
mentioned above we found the Parrakeets fairly numerous, but not
nearly as tame as on the former islands. We were fortunate in finding
a nest of almost fully fledged young ones within 2 feet of the ground.
This nest was in a hollow puriri tree and the three youngsters could
easily be reached by the hand. During the time my hand was inserted
in the nest it got covered with tiny lice-like insects ; when I withdrew
it it was covered with a brown crawling mass of these creatures.
Whether they came off the birds themselves or from the rotten wood
I do not know, but it must certainly have been very uncomfortable for
the birds. The youngsters were exact replicas of their parents except
that the cere was very large, occupying quite half of the beak.
I understood from other naturalists that the Parrakeets were also
very common on another small group of treeless islands to the north of
New Zealand. These islands we intended to visit but did not do so.
This was a matter of great regret to me, as I understood that owing to
the absence of trees the birds were ground-nesting.
It is almost impossible to get hold of any of the Cyanoramphus
Parrakeets now in New Zealand. On the mainland the birds are so
scarce and wary that no one is able to catch them. Then there are no
bird trappers, for all birds are protected and it is against the law to
own any native birds except Keas and Zosterops. Even were it possible
to get hold of any it would be impossible to get Government permission
to export them out of the country.
All the islands I have mentioned are bird sanctuaries, where all
bird-life is rigidly preserved and Government permission is needed to
visit them. This is, of course, as it should be, for no one wants to think
of the unique avifauna of New Zealand becoming extinct. But so long
as the islands are protected the birds will be safe from extinction. The
only fear now is from the increase of cats and rats upon the islands and
from forest fires. It has been known for cruising parties to land

on the islands and deliberately set fire to the forest during dry
weather.
If the New Zealand Government paid as much attention to
the wicked and wanton burning of forests, with its terrible toll of bird
life, which goes on everywhere unchecked, as it does to the slight moral
lapses of some of its citizens it would earn the thanks of posterity.
Buller says, in writing of this species in the second edition of his
work, published in 1888 : " It is quite the cottagers' friend in New
Zealand. Riding or driving through the suburbs of the provincial
towns--Porirua and Karori districts, for example, near Wellington--\0x25A0
you will notice in many of the farmers' houses and roadside cottages
small wooden cages of primitive construction (often merely a candle-
box or whisky-case, faced with wire-netting or thin bars) fixed up to
the front of the building or under the simple verandah. On closer
inspection each of these cages will be found to contain a tame
Parrakeet--the pet of the rustic home and ' Pretty Poll ' of the
family. I have often been quite impressed at finding how attached
these simple people become to their little captive." Now all is changed,
for, search as I would from one end of the country to the other in my
endeavour to obtain examples of this Parrakeet, I found only four
examples in captivity, and these belonged to two naturalists who kept
them and did not wish to part with them. Most New Zealanders do
not know that a Parrakeet ever existed in their country, so rare is this
bird to-day on the mainland.
The Yellow-fronted Parrakeet (Cyanorhamphus auriceps)
Rare as the Red-fronted Parrakeet is, this bird is far rarer. It is
almost unknown on the mainland of New Zealand, though in the middle
of the last century it was even commoner than the other bird,
appearing in flocks of countless numbers and devouring the corn
and fruit of the settlers.
The first time we met with this rare bird in a state of freedom was
on the Little Barrier Island. It will always stand out as one of the
" red-letter " days of my life, for it was on that day we climbed Mount
Archeria, the highest peak in the centre of the island. The island
looked so sinister and foreboding as we approached it that I little

dreamed of being able to stand on the top of its inaccessible-looking
peak. But it proved easier than it looked. The climb was one of the
most interesting I have ever done ; up to 500 feet the way lay through
dense manuka-bush, which is a secondary growth, replacing the burnt
forest, after that the way lay through virgin forest of mixed growth
until, at about 1,000 feet, this changed to kauri forest, there being many
magnificent specimens of this giant forest tree. At about 2,000 feet
this changed into semi-alpine rain-forest. Here it was a veritable
fantastic fairyland, stranger than was ever pictured in the imagination
of man. Everywhere seemed a fantastic mixture of trees, rocks, ferns,
and mosses. In some places, strange as it may sound, it was like a fairy
cavern where it was impossible to tell which was the ground, the rocks,
or the trees. From the top it was possible to see the whole island, running
in precipitous forest-covered ridges from the sea to the culminating point
in the centre.
On the summit one stood in the clear rarified atmosphere in the
brilliant sunshine, far above the rolling white mist clouds which the
currents of air wove into strange wraith-like shapes. It was here that
one realized the true significance of the beautiful Maori name
" Hauturu ", meaning " the resting place of the winds of Heaven
It was at a height of about 2,000 feet that we first heard the
chattering of Parrakeets, but it was a different note from that made by
the Red-fronted, a softer and more melodious sound. I realized almost
at once that it was the call of the Yellow-fronted Parrakeet from the
sound I had heard of a captive bird. But try as we would it
was impossible to see the birds ; the green of the plumage harmonized
so well with that of the trees that in the dim light of the forest it was
impossible to distinguish the birds. Fortunately on the way down,
not far from the summit, a pair of Parrakeets flew down into a low
sapling only a few feet away. One, to my surprise, proved to be
a Yellow-fronted and the other a Red-fronted. It almost looked as
though these were a pair, though this would be impossible. I watched
the bird which I took to be the hen for about a quarter of an hour ;
she was quite tame and appeared to take quite as much interest in me
as I took in her.
This delightful Parrakeet was at one time, fifty odd years ago,

quite common in English aviaries, but has, alas ! grown scarcer and
scarcer until at last it is practically extinct in the North Island, the
Little Barrier Island being one of the few places where it is found to-day,
and even there it is far from common. This is strange, for it is supposed
to be a very prolific breeder ; Gutherie Smith records having found
nine young ones in a nest.
The Yellow-fronted Parrakeet is now almost unknown in captivity
in its native land, for apart from its rarity it is an offence against the
law to keep it. I only came across two birds in my travels, both males,
and I am quite sure these were the only ones in captivity. There is
no more charming bird in existence from an aviculturist's point of
view than this dainty and intelligent little Parrakeet. It is very
beautiful, friendly, easy to feed, has no harsh notes, does not destroy
woodwork, and is altogether the most delightful bird one could wish for.
In the old days it was quite easily bred. It is a thousand pities that
a small breeding stock could not be obtained so that the race could be
perpetuated in captivity, but I am afraid that this will never be, and
we must be thankful to think that this species still exists at all--it
certainly would not have done had not certain islands been reserved
as sanctuaries.
To show how misleading statements regarding birds may be, I heard
whilst in the North Island that there was a large breeding colony of
these birds in the forest country between Lake Waikaremoana and the
Ruahine Mountains. I diligently traced down, from one to another,
the original person who knew the whereabouts of the birds, only to find
on reaching Lake Waikaremoana that the birds were plentiful--fifty
years ago !
Buller says in his monumental work, The Birds of New Zealand :
" The Yellow-fronted Parrakeet is easily netted and when caged soon
adapts itself to captivity. Twenty years ago a Mr. Bills of Dunedin
brought a hundred or more of them in cages to England, and they found
ready purchasers at a guinea each." What would such a consignment
be worth to-day ?
I made a special trip down to Stewart Island, intending to visit
some of the small outlying islands off the South Cape, mainly Moggy
Island, Evening Island, and Hidden Island, where this Parrakeet is

reported to be still found in considerable numbers. The Fates were
against us. We set out in a 50 ft. yacht, but the tempestuous seas
proved too much for our small craft. For nearly a week we battled with
the gales, having to seek, often enough, shelter in the wonderful inlets
off the coast of Stewart Island. What a relief it used to be to find refuge
in these quiet and beautiful waters which gave no indication of the
fury outside ! They were real havens of refuge, where we could light
a fire and thaw our frozen limbs and get something to eat. Eventually,
so bad did the seas become that we stood no earthly chance of ever
arriving at our destination, so reluctantly we had to turn stern about
and let the gale blow us back to safe anchorage in Half Moon Bay.
How these delicate-looking little Parrakeets manage to survive on
these small islands, which for four or five months of the year are
swept by bitter winds from the Antarctic, I do not know. The climate,
by all account, resembles that of the West Coast of Scotland. But this
bird, like so many others in New Zealand, seems to have been successful
in adapting itself to its environment, for it is very evident that no
member of the Parrot family could originally evolve under such adverse
conditions.
I visited Ulva's Island in quest of this bird, but failed to find it,
though I have no doubt that it was there, but our stays on the island
were of very short duration and we had little time to make a thorough
search of the dense forest.
Unlike the Bed-fronted Parrakeet, this bird does not seem to find
any of its food in the open, and I have never seen it on the flax plants.
It seems, more or less, to feed upon the fruits of the forest trees.
Buller says : "At irregular periods after intervals of from seven
to ten years this Parrakeet (in company with the preceding species)
visits the settled and cultivated districts in astonishing numbers,
swarming into the gardens and fields, devouring every kind of soft
fruit, nibbling off the tender shoots on the orchard trees and eating up
the pulse and grain in all directions. The last of these visitations
occurred in the early part of 1886 and the one before that was at the
close of 1877." Now all is changed, the Parrakeets have gone, never
to return, and few are New Zealanders who have been fortunate enough
to catch even a glimpse of this bird within recent years.

This year has been a very successful one with me, and my Parrakeets
have done remarkably well. I had only one young Queen Alexandra
egg-bound, and she very soon recovered. My greatest success has
been the breeding of my first Blue Alexandrine and two lutino Ring-
necks. All the young this year have been particularly healthy and
strong birds. In all thirty-two Parrakeets were reared successfully.
I shall now give a list of the birds reared.
Ring-necks (P. krameri)
First pair : A green male and yellow female. Three eggs and three
young fully reared.
Second pair : Both yellow birds. Three eggs ; all young dead in
shell.
Third pair : Green male and yellow female. Two eggs ; one young
reared but the other egg was infertile.
Fourth pair : Green male and yellow female. Four eggs ; two
young reared but the other two young died when eighteen days old.
Fifth pair : Green male and yellow female. Four eggs, which were
all infertile.
The hybrid Alexandrine and Ring-necked cock and green female
Ring-neck. Five eggs ; two young reared but the other three eggs
infertile.
In an aviary where I had turned out seven birds, two wild-caught
lutinos and five yellow-bred green birds, I found two lovely lutino
young birds fully reared.
Alexandrine Parrakeet (P. nipalensis)
First pair : Blue male and green blue-bred female. Three eggs ;
two young were reared and the third egg was infertile. One of the
young is a beautiful blue bird and the other a green.
Second pair : A pair of blue-bred green birds. Three eggs ; two
young reared, both green ; one egg infertile.

Third pair : A pair of blue-bred Greens. Two eggs, which were
both infertile.
Fourth pair : Green male, yellow female. Three eggs and reared
two young ones. Third young one died when sixteen days old.
Fifth pair: Both green birds. Two eggs, both broken during
incubation. Laid four more ; one young reared, two eggs addled and
one broken.
Malabar Parrakeet (P. peristeroides)
This pair, which breeds regularly every year, produced four eggs.
Reared three very fine young ones, and the fourth egg was infertile..
Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets ( Polytelis alexandrse)
My old pair laid six eggs and reared three young. Two eggs were
infertile and one contained a dead chick. They went to nest a second
time laying four eggs. Reared three young and the fourth egg contained
a dead chick.
Second pair : 1931 birds. Four eggs, but all broken. Four more
eggs were laid and one young one was hatched which was killed the
next day by the hen bird. Two eggs were infertile and one egg contained
a dead chick.

Third pair : 1932 birds. One egg ; then the hen became egg-bound.
She soon recovered and was not allowed to nest again.
Turquoisine Parrakeet ( Neophema pulchella)
A pair of these birds produced four eggs, but the male bird broke
them all.
Elegant Parrakeet ( Neonanodes elegans)
First pair : Five eggs. Three young reared ; two eggs infertile.
Second pair : Two eggs. Hen died of enteritis after incubating;
for nine days.

In Part III (July, 1934), of Vogel ferner Lander , the journal of the
chief German Society for Bird-keepers and breeders, is a most important
article by W. Schinke, President of the German Budgerigar Society,
headed " Wohin (Whither), deutscher Papageien- und Sittichzuchter
Its subject is the recent German legislation against Psittacosis , and its
effect on such societies as his and on fanciers generally. He gives in
full the text of the new Ordinance of 3rd July, 1934 (an Ordinance
for the Control of Parrot-disease (Psittacosis) and other contagious
diseases), and also the Regulations of 14th August under this Ordinance.
The provisions are wide-reaching and detailed, and under them keepers
and breeders of any species of Parrot and Parrakeet must be registered,
must keep quite elaborate books, showing the number of their birds,
whence obtained, where sent (if disposed of), and much besides. These
are to be kept up-to-date and open to inspection by the appointed
officers, while the birds themselves and their abode are also to be
ready at any time for medical inspection. Deaths and sickness have
of course to be reported immediately. The penalties for infringement
of the Ordinance are heavy--fines up to 150 RM. and/or imprisonment
up to three years.
Dr. Schinke goes fully in the whole matter, taking a very serious
view of the situation, and shows that not only are the big breeding
establishments likely to be effected, or even put out of action altogether,
but that the legislation is so all-inclusive and so worded as to embrace
even the keeper of a few birds, if they are Parrots, as Budgerigars
indisputably are. He concludes by calling on all Budgerigar breeders
and other bird-keepers to do all they can to assist him and the Fancy
Societies in their efforts to mitigate, if possible, the hardships this
legislation is likely to cause. The whole reads as if Budgerigar-breeding
in Germany would be crushed out of existence by this weight of paper-
work and control, and that seems to be the opinion of the writer,
though he has hopes that union may do something to help. The prospect
at the best is gloomy and if the article were to be translated into
English (it is well worth it) I should suggest that the title (instead of
" Wohin ? (Whither ?), etc. "), should be " Woe ! ye German Parrot-
and Parrakeet-breeders ! " E. H.

THE BREEDING OF THE SPLENDID GRASS
PARRAKEET FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN EUROPE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982051875" page_id="56219873"  page_num="289" year="" vol="">
By E. J. Boosey
Two breeding results of outstanding interest have been obtained
here at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm during 1934, namely the successful
rearing of broods of the Splendid Grass Parrakeet (Neophema
splendida) and the Yellow-fronted New Zealand Parrakeet (Cyanor-
hamphus auriceps) . The former have, I believe, never before been
reared in Europe, whilst the latter were bred some thirty odd years
ago by Mr. Bouskill, though never, I think, either before or since.
The pair of Splendids arrived here in late summer of last year and
were placed in an outdoor aviary possessing a heated shelter. One cold
autumn night the cock contracted a slight chill, due possibly to the
heater not being turned up high enough ; but, in any case, we considered
it safest to transfer the pair to a large flight cage, where they successfully
passed the winter.
This spring, as soon as they were put out into their original aviary,
they at once showed signs of wanting to go to nest; the hen continually
searching for nesting sites, and treating the most impossible crevices
as a suitable nursery for her children, while the cock flew from end
to end of the aviary, starting high up and dropping almost to the
ground half-way--rather like a courting cock Barraband but with
a less laboured flight--and ending high up on the wire at the farther
end of the run, with shoulders forward and wings depressed, reminding
one of a cock Bourke's when his wife is house-hunting. At the same
time he frequently uttered the plaintive piping notes which are so
reminiscent of a Bullfinch and so utterly unlike the call of any of his
near relatives.
When the nest-box--a natural hollow log--was put in, their excite-
ment knew no bounds, his wife--like most hen Parrakeets--pretending
to be terrified yet fascinated by the strange &amp;apos;object; while her husband,
after hovering round it for a few moments, eventually settled and
timidly poked his head into the entrance hole. Apparently, in spite
of the pitch darkness within, he found it to his liking, for by way of

encouragement to his wife he proceeded to go through all the motions
of having a bath in imaginary water, keeping up a curious hoarse
grumbling noise the while. This apparently proved irresistible to the
hen, who was shortly afterwards seen to enter the log, though she
discouraged further imaginary bathing on the part of her husband
by rushing out to drive him away each time he appeared at the entrance
hole. About this period he was frequently seen feeding her but it was
some considerable time before the first egg was laid. The full clutch
consisted of seven and the hen apparently started to sit after laying
the fourth.
Things went swimmingly for a week, and then one began to have
that dreadful feeling that it was all too good to be true, and so it turned
out to be. For when the hen had been sitting for ten days, the cock
suddenly became completely paralysed as to the wings and feet. He was
at once transferred to the hospital where he made a very slow, though
complete, recovery ; but meanwhile there seemed nothing for it but
to take away the eggs and distribute them under foster parents---
a hen Bourke's and a hen Turquoisine fortunately having just started
to sit at the same time.
This was duly accomplished and all seven eggs proved to be fertile.
Then " X " (the evil genius of aviculture, discovered and named by
Lord Tavistock) decided to intervene. This time he and Dr. Buchan
between them managed to produce several bitterly cold nights, just
at the psychological moment when the hen Torquoisine ceased to brood
her growing family of Splendids. As a result of this, all but two died,
these eventually being fully reared, and very fine youngsters.
At the same time, " X " achieved his real tour de force with the
brood under the Bourke's. Assisted by the extremely hot, dry weather,
he caused their log to split from end to end, hurling the young Splendids
into the long grass below. Needless to say, being very young, they
perished before the calamity was discovered.
By way of convincing those who do not believe in the actual existence
of " X ", one might mention that numerous similar logs were also
in use here at Keston (cut in some cases from the same tree) housing
at the time lesser rarities such as Bourke's, etc. All these, however,
remained intact, for " X ", who will usually turn a blind eye to the

propagation of Zebra Finches and Budgerigars (being probably much
too busy elsewhere !) was concerned only with the destruction of the
Splendids and he did his job fairly thoroughly, for from seven&amp;apos; fertile
eggs only three young ones were finally reared ; the third being an
oversight on " X's 55 part as well as our own, as an egg thought to be
one of those moved from the Bourke's was put under a Nyasa Love-
bird, who hatched and reared--a Splendid ! And a very nice one, too.
Meanwhile, the old hen had laid again, starting to sit about the
21st July, and this time nothing went wrong with the cock, and a nice
nestful of young ones was hatched about the 9th August. All appeared
to go well for several days, when that ominous charnel-house smell
began to be discernible in the vicinity of the log. On investigation,
all but two of the young ones were found to have died at various ages.
But the last two survivors were fully reared, leaving the nest on
27th August and 2nd September, respectively, and they are now flying
about with their parents.
The death of the others seems to have been due to two causes,
namely the rather cold nights when the young ones were first hatched,
and the fact that the cock is a lazy feeder when he has nestlings to
provide for.
We found that the hen had laid four more eggs before the young
ones left the nest, and these were removed and put under foster parents
*and the first of them has just hatched to-day, 17th September.
So far, therefore, the net result has been five young Splendids, three
under foster parents and two reared by the parents themselves, and
now a further brood just hatching under foster parents.
Incidentally, young cock Splendids are almost exactly like their
mother, with no sign of the brilliant dark blue mask or red patch on
the upper breast, which they will later possess, but showing, curiously
enough, her distinctive yellowish orange patch--only rather duller--*
on the lower breast. Young hens are similar, but the yellowish orange
area is replaced by greenish yellow.
For the benefit of the vast number of people who can never have
seen a living Splendid, the following short description of the cock is
taken from Lord Tavistock's Parrots and Parrot-like Birds.

blue, mixed with green at the back of the head. Upper breast green
at the sides with much red and orange-red in the centre ; abdomen
and under-tail coverts, yellow. A considerable amount of very pale
turquoise on the wing. Under wing coverts rich dark blue. Flights
blue with a green tinge to the edge of the outer webs and dusky inner
webs ; outer ones largely yellow. Bill black. Length 8 inches."
To this description one might add that in our breeding cock quite
two-thirds of the breast is the most brilliant scarlet ; whilst another
cock, presumably adult, has only the more or less round red patch
portrayed in some of the old books.
Written descriptions unfortunately seldom convey the full beauty .
of a bird. To those therefore who find it difficult to form a mental
picture from such descriptions, one can only say that our breeding
cock, when seen sitting in the sun, facing one, on a hummock of
grass, is a picture of quite incomparable brilliance.

THE BREEDING OF THE YELLOW-FRONTED
NEW ZEALAND PARRAKEET

The Cyanorhamphus Parrakeets, of which this is one of the smallest
members, are curious and interesting birds, differing in many respects
from all other Parrakeets. Their voices,for example,are unique,resembling 1
nothing so much as the far-off bleating of a sheep. This, on paper, does
not sound a particularly attractive cry, but as uttered by the bird it is 1
nevertheless quite a pleasant and not unmelodious sound.
A further and striking peculiarity is the way in which all the Parra-
keets of this genus have the purely gallinaceous habit of scratching
in the ground, like poultry, their long legs seeming particularly adapted
for this purpose, also enabling them to run and jump with extraordinary
rapidity. To watch them, there is something extraordinarily unbird-
like about their movements, and they always remind me more of some

Breeding of the Yellow-fronted New Zealand Barrakeet 293
small and nimble mammal, particularly when, as is often the case, they
run rapidly and jerkily down the wire netting from top to bottom
of an aviary.
Their prevailing colour is green, paler on the breast ; a band just
above the beak and a patch on the flanks bright red ; fore part of the
crown golden-yellow ; some blue on the lower edge of the wings. Bill
a pretty silver, shading into black at the tip. Length : 9*6 inches.
A striking feature of the bird, usually omitted in book descriptions,
is the very brilliant red iris of the eye.
The hen is usually not only considerably smaller than her mate,
but has a much smaller, rounder, and more feminine-looking head.
So marked are these differences that it is quite easy to sex young birds
by their size immediately they leave the nest.
The Yellow-front seems always to have been a rare species ; in fact,
our Editor informed us on his last visit to the Keston Foreign Bird
Farm that he could not remember having seen a living specimen before ;
and Mr. Sydney Porter describes them as nowadays excessively rare in
their native land.
It appears to have been bred by only one aviculturist, Mr. Bouskill,
who first had a brood of young ones in 1898 ; though there is little
doubt Yellow-fronts would, if given the chance, prove themselves no
less prolific than their cousin the Red-fronted, which at one time
seems to have been very extensively kept and bred in this country.
The first bird of this species, a solitary hen, arrived here in the late
spring of 1933 and, as there seemed little prospect of ever obtaining
a proper husband for her, she was mated to a cock Blue-wing since
these two Parrakeets are almost identical in size.
She and the Blue-wing quickly became attached to each other,
and the cock was continually seen feeding the hen, but the four eggs,
on which she sat her full time, proved to be unfertile.
Soon after this a mate of her own kind was unexpectedly obtained,
and was at once put in the aviary in place of the Blue-wing. Curiously
enough, the hen did not seem at all overjoyed at being presented with
a husband of her own race, and refused to go to nest again, shortly
afterwards falling into a heavy moult. This did not augur very hopefully
for successful breeding results the next year, and to make matters

worse the cock showed signs of attacking his wife shortly before they
were put into the heated acclimatizing room for the winter.
Accordingly, since the unpleasant habit of wife-murder is reputed
to be by no means an uncommon vice among the Cyanoramphus
Parrakeets, it was necessary to place the two birds in separate flight
cages. Once definitely parted, their behaviour was amazingly human,
for they instantly conceived a passionate attachment for each other,
carrying on long conversations in their curious bleating voices.
Early this spring we were able by a great stroke of luck to obtain
two further cock Yellow-fronts, both either belonging to a slightly
larger race, or else being much finer specimens than the original cock.
As, however, the latter and his wife seemed by dint of separation to
have at last developed a genuine affection for each other, we decided
to give them one more trial together, and they were returned to their
aviary about the end of May.
The hen at once took to the nest-box she had laid in the previous
year, namely a wooden box about 18 inches deep, by 7 inches square,
filled up to within about 5 inches of the hole with sifted earth ; the
whole of the front of the box being covered with natural bark. In
this, after much scratching about and preparing of the nest, she deposited
a clutch of eggs, all of which, however, again proved to be unfertile.
After the hen had sat on them long enough to prove that this was
the case, her eggs and her husband were both removed, the latter's
place being taken by the largest and finest of the two new cocks. The
hen's attitude towards her new husband was very different from the
indifference with which she had always treated her last mate. As soon
as the two were put together the new cock was very anxious to feed her,
but she was, or at any rate pretended to be, rather frightened of him
and always took care to get out of his way. At last, however, he managed
to persuade her that his offers of food had no murderous intent behind
them, and once more the hen began to disappear into the nest-box.
We knew that she had started to lay, but were unaware of the
number of the clutch and this time decided to leave well alone, so long
as the hen was observed off the nest having her invariable bath, going
back to the eggs, as was her custom, completely drenched through.
When she had been sitting for about three weeks the cock was

seen going into the nest-box at fairly frequent intervals, remaining
there for considerable periods at a time ; and soon one could hear the
very faint squeakings of young ones being fed.
Incidentally, I may mention here that as they grow older, the noise
of young Yellow-fronts in the nest is very unlike that of young Platy-
cercine Parrakeets or Grass Parrakeets, oddly resembling the screaming
of swifts as they wheel in wide circles on a summer evening.
The young ones were brought up entirely on their ordinary diet,
plus a considerable extra quantity of sunflower and millet spray and,
shortly before they left the nest, a heaped dessertspoonful of hemp
a day--a seed which does not seem to suit them at all well in any
quantity at other times. The parents also consumed vast quantities
of freshly-picked spinach-beet and were extremely fond of flowering
rye grass and apple.
Mr. Bouskill's birds seem to have eaten large numbers of mealworms
when they were bringing up their family, but I have only ever been
able to induce one of our New Zealands, the original rather small
infertile cock, to take any interest in mealworms at all.
When the breeding pair had young ones, I kept mealworms
always before them for a week or more in the hope that they would
eventually take to them, but with no success.
They certainly do not, therefore, appear to be essential to the
welfare of the brood as I had feared, for in our case not only did all six
eggs hatch but the whole family was successfully reared, and are now
fully independent of their parents.
The young ones remained in the nest for just over five weeks and
came out on 6th September, as rather duller editions of their parents
but, as I have said, perfectly easy to sex owing to the marked difference
in the size of the cocks and the hens.
To begin with they were rather silent little birds, but are now, 25th
September, starting to practise in rather small, tentative voices their
curious sheep-like bleating. They are also starting to evince the tireless
energy which characterizes the race, running, jumping, hopping, and
flying so quickly that their separate movements are difficult to
follow.
It was amusing to watch their parents teaching them to scratch

for their food in the heap of peat-moss on which a supply of seed was
thrown morning and evening.
Yellow-fronts readily become tame, and would, I imagine, make
the most attractive pets. They are consumed with curiosity, and
any unfamiliar object that is put into their aviary has to be instantly
and thoroughly examined.

The September issue of the Avicultural Magazine is at hand to-day,
and I find that my usual delightful anticipation of its monthly arrival
is again rewarded by some most interesting articles.
In particular I was interested in Mr. Moody's mention of a newly-
acquired pair of our American Cackling Geese ( Branta minima). We sent
two pairs to Mr. Ronald Stevens in the spring and at that time I thought
them the only ones in England, although I have learned differently
since.
Our Cackling Goose, as Mr. Moody says, is roughly a miniature
edition of the Canada. However in America we feel that it is too
widely separated from the Canada, even though superficially similar,
to be classed a sub-species of that goose and there is some movement
on foot to have the Cackling Goose and its very close relative, the
larger White-cheeked Goose of the Pacific coast, given specific rank,
the White-cheeked Goose (. Branta canadensis occidentalis) as a species
distinct from the Canada, and the Cackling a sub-species of the White-
cheeked, with which it is identical except in size.
The range of the White-cheeked Goose (which is now almost extinct)
coincides very closely with that of the smaller Cackling, both being
birds of our Pacific coast only. Both have the short, stubby bill, dark
grey breasts, and more or less well defined white ring at the base of the
black neck, which are very distinct from the head, form and colouring
of the Canada and its close relative, the smaller Hutchins Goose, identical
with the Canada except in size.

There are records of the Canada and Hutchins Goose ( B. hutchinsi)
hybridizing and producing fertile young. Yet in mixed collections
containing Canadas, Hutchins, and Cackling Geese, the Cackling do
not fraternize with either the Hutchins or Canada, whereas the Hutchins
and Canadas will stay together as a flock outside the breeding season.
I can find no record where either the Canada or Hutchins has made
any attempt to pair with the White-cheeked Goose or the Cackling.
One would, of course, hardly expect pairing of Cackling and Canada
because of too great disparity in size, but the Hutchins and Cackling
are not too unlike in size to pair if there were any inclination to do so.
The Hutchins is a trim little goose, a smaller and Western edition
of the Canada in every detail, but not so uninterestingly domesticated
as the Canada has become and presenting more difficulty in inducing
it to breed. The Cackling is still smaller, less in size than the European
Brent. It is a more ornamental and interesting little goose, and its
size and amiable disposition make it a real addition to a mixed collection
of small geese and ducks. Our Cackling is much less plentiful than
formerly, due to continued shooting in its migrations through the
United States and also the practice of the Eskimos on its Arctic breeding
fields of netting great numbers of birds during the time when the
flight feathers have been moulted and the birds are for a time incapable
of flight. The rare and lovely little Emperor Goose is also netted in
the same way and at the same time as both varieties have the
same nesting grounds. Because of the quite restricted area
in which both species nest, one or two unfavourable seasons could
easily bring Cackling and Emperor (.Philacte canagica) to the verge
of extinction.
To date, very few collectors have bred the Cackling Goose in confine-
ment, largely because there has been an ample supply of wild birds
available at a moderate price. However, during the last several
years, with a shortage of wild birds, more effort has been made to
produce confinement-reared stocks, with some degree of success, and
I am glad to be able to say that there are now a few confinement-
reared birds in the hands of good breeders, so that, if our
supply of wild birds should be destroyed in some way, there is still
a chance to continue the species in captivity.

298 Harold M. Millar--Some Notes on the Yellow-breasted Bulbul
Of the twelve species or races of geese native to America, all have
been bred in confinement except our two Brent, and I have not been
able to learn after much inquiry of either races having nested in
confinement.
We Americans have been so busy adding foreign geese to our
collections that we have overlooked the beauty and interest of our own
native species. Mr. Moody's mention of the Cackling has again brought
forcibly to my mind the fact that our native geese have had their
deepest appreciation from fanciers outside our own borders. I sincerely
hope that our various American species will prove interesting and
charming ambassadors of goodwill for American collectors.

SOME NOTES ON THE YELLOW-BREASTED
BULBUL
(Criniger flaviventris)

This Bulbul is found in the dense bush along the coast of Natal
and Zululand. It is one of eighteen recorded species in Africa south
of the Equator.
Its length is 9 inches from tip of bill to tip of tail.
As to the colour of this bird, the following may be found clear
enough to obtain a correct impression. The entire upper parts of dark
olive brown except the eyebrow which is pale yellow ; the chin and
throat of pale yellow ; the breast and flanks of pale greenish yellow.
The centre of belly and under tail coverts brighter yellow. The legs
are leaden grey, and the iris dark hazel.
This bird appears to prefer its own company, and is seldom seen
with more than one of its kind, and should be classed as of the few
inoffensive or unaggressive. I have never seen them attack smaller
birds while feeding. Small fruits and insects are sought for. To nest
they gather very light roots which are intertwined, saucer like, on to

a supporting twig usually 5 feet from the ground, the nest some-
what resembling the usual thin nest of a Dove, through which the
eggs may be seen. Thus it has a very flimsy appearance.
The nest is always built in a conspicuous position in the dense
bush, and probably is often robbed of eggs and young by either snakes
or Shrikes.
This Bulbul is certainly to be classed as uncommon, and I think
the cause of this is to be found in its nesting methods. The tempera-
ment of this species seems to be of a nervous nature ; it seems to be
always fearing the approach of a Sparrowhawk. About the month of
September, 1932, while visiting friends in the countryside some twelve
miles from Durban, I had a most unusual and interesting experience
which may be of interest to bird-lovers. My friends are great lovers
of nature and the family has caused to be registered in perpetuity
as a " Sanctuary for Birds and Animals " some 60 acres with the
boundary quite half a mile long, with the River Umhlatuzan flowing by,
and plenty of indigenous bush and forest and grass-land. There may
be seen birds of many kinds and of beautiful colours, enjoying to the
full the quietness of the sanctuary. Three species of South African
antelope are there, and may be seen at any and all times of the day.
So tame have they become that from a motor car they may be watched
within 20 feet distance, and quite unconcerned. While walking
along the motor drive at the sanctuary with my friend, Mr. Fred North,
we observed a fine doe antelope standing some 20 or so feet off the
road in the open bush. She had seen us first, and remained motionless.
While so standing she had the attention of a Yellow-breasted Bulbul
removing ticks from the edges or rims of her ears. The bird using
the crown of the doe's head as a perch from which it hopped to the
ear, and then flew to and alighted on the haunch of the buck and back
to the head, and repeated the performance of hopping and removing
the ticks some five times, when we were quietly watching. The buck
and bird were in company while we walked away. Mr. North has
built a water trough for the wild birds to drink from near his home,
and great success has been accomplished.
During last July I there saw nine beautiful Purple-crested Louries

pleasure.

As the full account of the breeding of the Kosy Pastor has never
appeared in the Magazine, owing to the continued illness of the late
Mr. Gr. H. Gurney, I thought perhaps a few notes by me would be of
some interest to our members. On my arrival at Keswick to take up
my duties as curator, I found among the collection a fine pair of the
above species. On making inquiries I found that they had been there
for several seasons, but had never been induced to breed, although
given every opportunity. Every year they got no farther than carrying
about small pieces of nesting material, and it was thought they would
never nest. During the latter part of the summer, as we wished to use
their aviary, they we^re transferred into a large enclosure and shelter,
which also contained, among other birds, a pair of Crimson-wing
Parrakeets, Cockateels, and two pairs of Crowned Lapwings. In less
than a couple of days the Pastors had turned the Crimson-wings
out from their nesting log and had started nest building in earnest.
A few days later I missed the hen, but was sure she was alive by the
frequent visits of the cock to the nest, and at last I felt certain that
they meant business. Incubation, as near as I could tell, lasted
seventeen days, when I heard faint noises which told me young were
hatched ; and the cock, who had always been rather wild, now came
to the wire and asked to be fed with mealworms, which he took into
the nesting log. All went on well until about fourteen days later when,

going my rounds on a Sunday afternoon, I found the door to the
enclosure wide open and the Lapwings running on the gravel path
outside. These were full-winged, and I feared they would fly away but,
by carefully walking behind them, three of them were easily driven
back into their home. The fourth one, however, flew over the garden
gate into the wood which was close by. On going into the aviary
to inspect, I found that neither the Pastors nor any of the other inmates
had ventured forth. How the door came to be open was a mystery.
Nothing more was seen of the Lapwing until three days later when
it appeared close to the duck pond, and seemed to be quite at home
feeding with the waterfowl. After a long and trying time I was able
to catch it, none the worse for its adventures.
About sixteen days later a young Pastor left the nest, quite strong
and a good flyer, but this was the only one reared, the other eggs failing
to hatch. They were of a pale blue in colour. The young one closely
resembled a young common Starling, and caused much comment when
people visited the aviaries and were told what it was. In fact, one
well-known aviculturist asked why we were keeping a common Starling,
and seemed rather surprised when told what it was. The young bird
was a long time coming into full colour, and never attained the beautiful
rose-tinted breast of its male parent although I am sure it was a cock.
These birds are rather interesting, and I think ought to be more freely
kept, as they are quite easy to cater for, and are long-lived and hardy.
The display and song of the male is quite interesting.

but is somewhat rare, and in many localities never seen. It is always
found close to water, and the present pair was found by Mr. Webb,
on a small island in the Reime River in Portuguese East Africa.
They are partly nocturnal, and this pair of birds were sheltering in the
reeds during the intense heat of the day. When disturbed they perfer

to run rather than fly, especially if there is cover close at hand, and it
was this fact that enabled Mr. Webb to catch them--the only pair
he had ever seen. A tunnel-shaped net fixed in the evening on the track
where they ran when disturbed, enabled Mr. Webb to drive them both
underneath next morning. Some writers say that Water Thick-knees,
for some unknown reason, are attracted by crocodiles, specially on
Lake Victoria, where they may be seen frequently where these reptiles
are basking on the shore. They are lacking in parts of the shore where
there are no reptiles. Where these birds were caught, crocodiles were
quite numerous, so much so that Mr. Webb was not too happy when
wading across to the island, but luckily the water was clear enough
for him to see their whereabouts. Very little is known of these shy
and retiring birds in their wild state, as they are very seldom seen,
but it's near relative the Bush Thick-knee (Burhinus capensis) is
not uncommon in certain districts where there is often thorn bush
scrub.
About six years ago I got the above pair of birds from Mr. Webb
and they have been in a large aviary with a good many other birds,
among them a pair of South African Crowned Plovers. They have
never attempted to nest till this year, when they started carrying
leaves and grass about the 8th July. They finished a sort of a nest,
consisting of small stones, leaves, and grass under a Cupressus. First egg
was laid on the 15th July and the second on the 17th. Only two eggs
laid. One egg was broken on the 24th, but the other one was hatched
on the 9th August. For the first few days the young one would lie
flat on the ground as soon as anyone approached it, pretending to be
dead. When about ten days old it began hiding in clumps of grass
and was very hard to find. The parents were ideal and looked after
their offspring beautifully. No birds or any of us were allowed to
approach it. If we tried to get near the young bird both the parents
attacked us with outstretched wings and violent hissing. The young
bird was reared on ants eggs, gentles, mealworms, and insectivorous
mixture to start with. When about a fortnight old it ate the stock
food, always devouring the meat first. These birds are very hardy
and good livers and perfectly harmless with other birds. I believe this
is the first time they have been reared in captivity.

The Council propose the following :--\0x25A0
As members of Council : Mrs. Wharton-Tigar and Mr. R. S.
de Quincey, in place of Mr. G. H. Gurney and E. G. B. Meade-Waldo,
deceased ; Mr. D. Seth-Smith in place of Mrs. Goddard, retired.
As Editor : The Honourable Anthony Chaplin.
As Auditor : Colonel A. E. Hamerton, C.M.G., D.S.O.
As Scrutineer : Mr. James B. Housden.
The Council regret to have to announce the resignation of
Mr. Seth-Smith as Editor of the Avicultural Magazine. He has held
this post for twenty-one years, not consecutive years, but nearly so.
As we all know, it is chiefly due to him that the high standard of the
Magazine has been maintained, and we cannot be too grateful to him
for all the work it must have entailed, and we beg him to accept our
very sincere thanks.
The Council propose the Honourable Anthony Chaplin be elected
as Editor for the year 1935. E. M. K.

THE DISPOSAL OF DEAD BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998775533333333" page_id="56219891"  page_num="303" year="" vol="">
Mr. C. B. Scott's suggestion that upon death our rare and beautiful birds
should be mounted and presented to schools is a commendable one. Personally
I always ask the Natural History Museum if they desire the body of any
bird that I may lose. In most instances they do, and one receives a handsome
acknowledgment upon vellum. Not always are the birds or other subjects
needed for exhibition, but for scientific study. A few years ago I was fishing
off Nasau, Bahamas. I pulled up a bright scarlet fish. Attached to the neck*
if a fish has a neck, was a long parasite. It was ten minutes before this
parasite died and released its hold, leaving two holes plainly visible where
its prongs had been buried. I got a large, empty, glass olive jar from the
steward and I wasted #1 upon two bottles of whisky. I put the fish and
parasite in the bottle, filled it up with Scotch, and screwed down the lid.
As soon as I arrived back I wrote the Museum asking if they would care for
this specimen. Several scientists from that Institution wrote per return
saying " Yes please ". One was a lady--a lady doctor. She of course received

the specimen. Later the Institute handsomely asknowledged the gift, as
before-mentioned. One never knows what is needed there for scientific
research and study. I know for instance that they are anxiously awaiting
the death of one of the Black Mamba's which I procured for " The Zoo ".
Aviculturists therefore may possess what is to them a worthless dead bird,
but which is of interest to science.

BREEDING OF CHINESE JAY THRUSHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991402634146341" page_id="56219892"  page_num="304" year="" vol="">
In the pages of Cage Birds, vol. lxii, No. 1595, 6th August, 1932, p. 69,
appeared a photo of a pair of Chinese Jay Thrushes ( Dryonastes chinensis)
(Scopoli) (old name Garrulax), dealers' name, Canton Mocking Bird. This
photo was accompanied by a letter to the Editor under the nom de plume
" Cardinal", stating that the pair had laid two eggs, and that there was
every hope that the young would be reared. Among my queries during
July of this year was one from a correspondent asking me whether
this species had been bred in Great Britain. I replied to the effect that
I thought not, and after consulting Dr. Hopkinson's valuable compilation,
I concluded that the writer's success in rearing the young Jay Thrushes
was the first recorded instance. Thinking that it would be a pity if the
particulars were lost in obscurity, I corresponded with the querist", a
Mr. H. Kenway, of Llandudno, who kindly supplied me with photos of
the old birds feeding the young after leaving the nest, and the particulars
regarding the occurrence are as under : 1932, first egg laid 21st June, and
another the following day. They hatched on 5th and 6th July. They left
the nest on the fifteenth day, and at three weeks were fighting each other so
dangerously that Mr. Kenway had to separate them and cage one up.
At four weeks to the day one young bird was heard trying its best to imitate
the song of the male, and eventually became very tame and a fine singer,
but at eighteen months lost the sight of one eye. The other young bird
was discovered dead at five weeks old. Mr. Kenway states that when the
young were in the nest the old birds were very fierce, the hen attacking
from above by striking the owner on the top of the head, and the cock always
going for the left eye, very nearly succeeding in wounding Mr. Kenwav on
one occasion. In addition to soft food the old birds were supplied with
plenty of " gentles ", cleaned in meal and given alive.
A pair of these birds some years ago, kept by someone in the South of
England known to a Mr. Frank Smith, Liverpool, and quoted by Butler in
Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary , pt. i, p. 45, are said to have started
to breed, but broke up their eggs. The older aviculturists will remember
that this attractive species was at one time much more readily obtainable
than it is to-day.
In Calcutta, according to Finn, it was known under its Chinese name of
" Peko ", where it was prized as a songster and mimic. I think the first
living examples I ever saw belonged to Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., of Bexley
Heath, some thirty-four years ago. Like many of their allied brethren they
are not hard to keep, and are attractive birds for a shrubbed aviary, moving
with extreme rapidity among boughs.

In the British Museum Catalogue of Birds , vol. xx, is a coloured
plate of the heads of certain Amazon Parrots, which is supposed to
show the characters of the different species ; but being drawn from
dried skins a very important difference, revealed in the living specimens,
has been missed.
Mr. Herbert Whitley, with his unrivalled series of living examples
of Amazona, is responsible for the discovery that in Amazona
diademata the red feathers in the forehead project forward and com-
pletely cover the nostrils, whereas in A. salvini, the most nearly-
related species, as in others of the genus, the nostrils are fully uncovered.
We are indebted to Mr. Whitley for the loan of the accompanying
photographs.

the Chatham Island Parrakeet. I should use the past tense, for this
bird has now joined the many species of the Cyanorhamphus group
which have been exterminated by human agency. The extinction of
this rare Parrakeet was directly brought about by a well-known
ornithologist in this country, who years ago had agents in the Chathams
collecting large series of skins of the various island species, many of
which inhabited islands of only a few square miles. The Parrakeet soon
disappeared and a party of scientists who had been over there recently
failed to find it at all even though they made an extensive
search. And all we have is a few perishable skins now transferred to
America.
There are no records of the wild life of this bird so, like the Alpine
Parrakeet, its history is now a closed book.
The Alpine Parrakeet (Cyanorhamphus malherbei)
Try as I might, I was unable to trace anything about this dainty
little Parrakeet. After travelling about in the various districts where
it was once found and by questioning many people who should have
known it, I reluctantly came to the conclusion that if not actually on
the verge of extinction it must be excessively rare. In the Southern
Alps, its original habitat, it seemed to be quite unknown to anyone
there. The only recent data concerning it was a fresh skin received
at the Auckland Museum from the Nelson&amp;apos; District. There is little
doubt that in a few years' time this species will become extinct, for
it is not found on any of the island sanctuaries, though it was reported
to have been found on the Little Barrier Island and on the Hen Island.
This was in the middle of the last century. It is certainly not found
there now, though why it should become extinct, when its two con-
genitors are still found there, I do not know.
Buller in his Birds of New Zealand says of this bird, " In its
native haunts it may be found frequenting the alpine scrub, in pairs
or small parties, and is very tame and fearless. It is by no means
uncommon in the wooded hills surrounding Nelson. ... At Nelson
I saw many caged birds of this species, and one in particular was
remarkable for the clear manner in which it articulated the words
&lt;f Pretty Dick ", repeating them all day long in the most untiring way."

Sydney Porter--Notes on the Cyanorhamphus Parrakeets 307
Fifty or more years ago it was very occasionally imported into this
country, but was never bred here, although there is a record of some
young ones being reared in France in 1883. This unobtrusive little
bird seems to have been known but for a few years, twenty or thirty
at the most, and to have passed on, regretted only by those of us who
deplore the wanton and wasteful destruction of Nature's most finished
products. At the present rate another two or three hundred years
will see the end of nearly all feathered life on this globe of ours, unless
Man providentially manages, with the aid of poison gas, etc., to exter-
minate himself.
Looking through much literature I have been unable to find anything
concerning this bird in captivity, and no one I met in New Zealand
had either kept it or seen it alive, so its history now appears to be a
closed book.
The Society Island Parrakeet [Cyanorhamphus nealandicus )
Only three species of the Cyanoramphus Parrakeets were found in
islands lying within the tropics and far from the typical habitat of
this group of birds. The Society Islands are a group of small and
remote islands lying almost midway between Australia and South
America. The species was first made known by Captain Cook, who
first visited the island in the eighteenth century. Not long after the
settling in the islands of the white traders the Parrakeet commenced
to disappear and nearly fifty years ago it was reported as extinct,
only two specimens being known. It was one of the few Parrakeets
in this family which had a juvenile plumage.
The adult bird differed rather from most of the family. In colour,
the forehead was black, a stripe through the eye and also the rump
feathers being scarlet, the flight feathers blue and the rest of the body
a bright green.
The Ulietea Island Parrakeet [Cyanorhamphus ulietanus)
Like the last-mentioned Parrakeet, this species is also extinct.
It was confined to one small island in the Society Group and was
reported extinct over a hundred years ago. This bird differed from all
the other members of the family by having the plumage an olive brown

colour, the head brownish black, the rump and basal upper tail coverts
brownish red, the under parts olive yellow. It was the most distinctive
in colouring of all the Cyanorhamphus Parrakeets. Nothing is known of
its habits and only one or two skins are in existence.
The Lord Howe Island Parrakeet (Cyanorhamphus suhflavinscens)
A Parrakeet very closely resembling the Norfolk Island Parrakeet
(Cyanorhamphus cooki) was once plentiful on Lord Howe Island, but
soon after the island was colonized by the white races the extermination
of this Parrakeet began. It was shot, no doubt, by the settlers owing
to its feedingupon the growing corn. This bird has now been extinct
for between thirty and forty years. It was slightly smaller than
C. cooki , but resembled it in colouring.
It is sad to think that of the fifteen known species of this family
no less than six are now extinct and the others, with the exception of
the Red-fronted Parrakeet which is only numerous on certain small
islands, are on the verge of extinction.
The Kermadec Island Parrakeet [Cyanorhamphus n. cyanurus)
A matter of between five and six hundred miles to the north-east
of New Zealand lie a group of small islands known as the Kermadecs,
which until recent years were inhabited by a single family who raised
sheep on one of the largest islands, namely Sunday Island. Pinding
that, with the slump in wool prices, farming on these lonely islands
was not a commercial proposition, the family left and, I believe, the
islands are now left to their original inhabitants, the birds.
Before the advent of man to this lonely spot a small Parrakeet
of the Cyanorhamphus group was exceedingly plentiful, in fact it still
is on some of the small outlying islands, where cats and rats have not
been introduced. Where these pests have found a home on the larger
islands the ranks of the Parrakeets have been sadly thinned out.
I had the good fortune whilst in New Zealand to see a true pair of
these very rare Parrakeets, which were in the possession of a gentleman
who had been on an expedition to. the islands and had managed to
secure this pair of birds. The hen was nesting, sitting I believe on
eight eggs in a hollowed-out tree trunk in her small aviary. This, I

understood, was the second time the birds had laid, the first time laying
eight eggs which proved infertile. I left before the result of the second
clutch was known. The birds were in rather cramped quarters and
it was hardly to be wondered at that the eggs were infertile. The owner
said he was going to re-wire a large aviary, occupied by Peafowl, with
small mesh wire, so that the Parrakeets could be turned into it and
thus have a better chance of breeding. It is to be hoped that this is
done, for a brood of these rare birds would be a great acquisition from
an aviculturist's point of view.
Though similar to the better known Red-fronted Parrakeet this
bird differs in several points. It is larger, the wings and tail are a
much brighter blue and the cheeks are a bright emerald green, also they
struck me as being a different shape ; for one thing the head appeared
to be smaller and the neck much thicker. The red spot on the back
is larger than in the Red-fronted, the hen can also be more easily told
from the cock by her differently shaped head.
The owner of the birds, who, as previously mentioned had been to
the Kermadecs, told me that the Parrakeets were very plentiful on
the smaller islands but were very rare on Sunday Island--the one
where the sheep farm had been. They nested in crevices in the ground
and fed mainly on grass seed.
The birds referred to were in very fine condition, being fed mainly
on natural food with little seed, the hen of the pair was not the original
one, she having died of egg binding after laying twenty eggs.
A pair of these birds were imported into this country a few years
ago, having been presented to the late Governor who, when
he retired, brought them back to Great Britain, and for all I know
they may still be here.
If this chapter happens to meet with the eye of the owner of the
birds in New Zealand perhaps he will be good enough to send us a little
more information about them, which I am sure would be very welcome,
as so little seems to be known of these exceedingly rare birds.
There is only one skin of this bird in the British Museum and that
was obtained from Raoul Island.

By Dr. E. Hopkinson, C.M.G., D.S.O.
[Continued from A.M., 1933, pp. 137, 396 )
So many more records have accumulated since the last collection
appeared in 1932 and 1933 that I think it as well to issue a further
instalment, before the numbers get too unwieldy to handle. In doing
so I wish to thank those who have complied with my request to help
with additions and corrections, and repeat that request here. But
better still will not someone go further into the subject and produce
another and fuller Records of Birds Bred in Captivity. Mine, although
only published in 1926, I realize (probably better than others), is now
getting out of date ; the volume of the additions which have already
appeared in the Magazine alone proves that. More information, too
(if it can be found), is desirable, particularly as to the length of life
captive-bred birds attain and how often. The number of records
must now be near a thousand, but in how many of them have (1) the
young lived to moult or reach (say) six months old ? (2) In how many
have full clutches been reared ? (3) How many species have been bred
to a second generation and/or further ? One must have noticed that
so many records read " a fine youngster (or youngsters) now flying
in the aviary, quite independent of its parents " or words to that
effect and in most cases a month or less after flying, always in the
same season. One does occasionally see, it is true, " the so-and-so bird,
I bred three years ago here, is still alive and flourishing," but how very
occasionally ! It is only natural that the record should be made early,
but this very fact alone tells against real accuracy and gives none of
the very important information required. My own idea (and this
probably optimistic) is that perhaps 50 per cent would (or might)
come under No. 1, 20 per cent under No. 2, and, excluding the Canary,
Budgerigar, and perhaps Bengalese, duck, game birds, etc., 5 per cent
under No. 3.
Then again, as regards British birds, a correspondent says I must
now include these as commonly bred for there is just as good evidence
now in the Fancy papers of their breeding as that on which I have
relied hitherto, namely the advertisements of aviary-bred close-ringed

cage-birds, which include all the usually kept birds and even such
delicate ones as Nightingales and Long-tailed Tits. He says this
evidence must stand, for it surely is not credible that in law-abiding
England we have such a lot of law-breakers about, as there must be
if all these birds are not bred in confinement. I can give no opinion
on that but, although I wrote in the Preface to the original work that
my object was to give as complete a list of records as possible and let
them stand on their own merits, I feel that the line must be drawn
somewhere, and I do it here, regarding all these advertisements as
business announcements, not records. This may be inconsistent, but
I cannot help that. Nightingales, perhaps, but Long-tailed Tits are
beyond the limit, while " Linnets in perfect plumage bred in my own
aviaries ", at Is. 6 d. also takes a low of swallowing. By the way, as
I was asked the other day, is there any really good record of the
Linnet having been bred ?
Now we come to the Additions proper.
In the 1932 and 1933 volumes of the Avicultural Magazine
(pp. 149, 191, 223, 319 ; 42, 79, 99, 131) a record of additions to my
Records of Birds Bred in Captivity (Witherby, 1926) appeared. Since then
more have accumulated and are given here. The arrangement is the
same as in the earlier instalment, the references being to the pages
and numbers of the original work.
p. 3. Add : No. 12. i, Black-throated Saltator (S. atricollis V.).
Bred for the first time by Whitley in 1933 ; three young left
the nest about 1st June ; I saw them in August and think
they are all still alive (September, 1934).
p. 5. No. 19. The reference should read, B.N., 1915, 219, not 239.
p. 7. Add to the Chaffinch entry No. 28 : and Blaauw tells me
(in lit., 5th April, 1933) that he bred the Algerian race (F. c.
spodiogenys) at Gooilust " many years ago ".
p. 179. No. 29. Add : A recent record of the rearing of a Brambling-
Chaffinch hybrid appeared in A.M., 1932, 179 (Sweetnam).
p. 9. The Black Siskin (S. atratus (D'Orb. and Lafr.)), it seems,
must be added as No. 38, i, for Whitley tells me (1933) that
a " Bolivian Black Siskin ( C . atrata) " was exhibited by
Mr. G. P. Malcolm at the Scottish National Show, January,

1933, in the A.O.V. class, and also a young hen bred from
the cock exhibited and an imported hen. Authority, the
Cage Bird report of the Show.
p. 187. Add to the Angola Singing Finch entry. Teague (in lit.,
November, 1932) tells me that he bred some Angola Singing
Finch X Canary hybrids in 1928 and that one (at least)
of the young birds, which was sent to Horley, was still alive
in 1932.
p. 14. The Cape Canary entry, No. 65, requires amendment, for
Teague tells me (November, 1932 ) that he bred them " Quite
freely in 1927 and 1928, and sent to other people two pairs
of the young he reared."
p. 20. Add: Lapland Bunting (Calcarius lapponicus (Linn.)).
Teschemaker sends me (14th February, 1933) some extracts
from his old note-books, among which is the breeding by him
of this Bunting in 1916. Three young were hatched, one
of which lived in his aviary for a year or more. Details were
sent at the time (about June) to the correspondence columns
of Cage Birds.
p. 20 and A.M., 1932, 151. Harris's Sparrow. From an account
of the discovery in the Auk., 1932, 166, the nest and eggs
were found in the spring of 1931, i.e. earlier (not later as
I wrote) than Shore Baily's success.
p. 197. a, Indigo Bunting x Canary. One of the hybrids bred by
Thomasset in 1915 was still alive and well in 1929 when
I saw it.
p. 26. No. 116. White-winged Whydaii. Teschemaker writes
(14th February, 1933) that the young went to Dr. Amsler,
and that full details were sent to Cage Birds at the time.
p. 33. Painted Finch. No. 145. In a Summary issued in 1932, the
Painted Finch was marked with a query. Teschemaker asked
me why and, on looking up the records again, I find I was
following a wrong trail--a sentence in a more recent note in
the Magazine on this bird. I now see that both the records
given can stand. Mathias bred his birds from " Willford's pair "
(his old pair or those he bred ?--E,H.); the young " left the

July), and later (p. 226) " indications of nesting a third time "
in the List of Successes.
p. 35. Dufresne's Waxbill. No. 153. Add : Bred for the first time
in the United Kingdom by Miss Robinson of Camberley ; four
young were reared, 1934. See full account with a photo of
the young. A.M., 1934, 249, and a note on p. 247.
p. 205. Add : d, Zebra Waxbill x Cordon-bleu. Allen Silver tells
me (in lit., 24th August, 1934) that Mr. W. N. Piers, of
Beckenham, tells him that he has reared two hybrids of this
cross, out of three hatched ; they are " mousey " in colour,
but " favour the Cordon in size The breeder has since
recorded the event in Bird Fancy, 1934, 785 (September).
p. 206. Add: c, Java Sparroav x Bengalese. In addition to the
Japanese record given in A.M., 1932, 193 (ex. 1931, 322),
another comes from South Africa. Cage Birds, 1933, June,
has a drawing of a hybrid of this crossbred by Sellar's of
Durban in 1931. This bird proved fertile when paired with
a hen Bengalese and had had one young bird in 1933,
which had left the nest and was doing well at the time of
writing (i.e. a quarter Java, three-quarter Bengalese
cross).
p. 207 and A.M., 1932,194. Chestnut-breasted Finch x Bengalese.
The Foreigner for July, 1934, records the breeding of this cross
in California and says " we cannot trace any previous record ".
I put Whitley's record, 1929, on paper in 1932 (A.M., as above),
but used the name " Chestnut Finch " ; I still think Whitley's
is the first.
p. 42. No. 183. Crimson Finch. A recent record of success in the
United Kingdom appeared in Cage Birds of 17th September,
1932 (p. 261). The breeder was Mr. Head, of Broughton Ferry,
and five young birds were reared.
p. 216. Add: f, St. Helena x Orange-cheek Waxbill. Bred by
Mrs. Drake in Cornwall in 1932 ; see A.M., 1932, 13, 259.
" Four young were reared from two nests " and Mrs. Drake
told me later (March, 1933) that she bred this cross both in

C.P. Show." Deferences as given in A.M., 1932.
p. 45. No. 191. i, Violet-eared Waxbill. The entry in "Additions",
A.M., 1932, 226, can be amplified to read : Teague (in lit.,
4th February, 1933) tells me that " Mr. Geo. Adlesparre had
these Waxbills breeding in his aviary at Durban, Natal, in
1915 ", and that he (Teague) saw the young. In Vogel ferner
Lander, 1832, 24, there is a record of success in Germany,
Herr Thiess of Zwenkau being the breeder ; this was in 1931,
and three young were reared. This must be the first record
for Europe, and is the success referred to by Decoux in
A.M., 1932.
p. 49. Add: Festive Tanager (Tangara cyanocephala (Muller) ).
Bred for the first time by Mrs. Pearce in 1934 ; one young
bird reared, thriving, although blind in one eye, at the time
of report to A.M., 1934 (p. 220).
p. 50. and A.M., 1932, 319. Yellow-winged Sugar-bird. A success
in the United Kingdom is now on record, A.M., 1934, 219,
where the breeder, Mrs. Drake, gives a full account of the
event; two young were alive at the time of writing, and had
left the nest, and one was still alive, Mrs. Drake tells me,
two months later (4th September).
p. 50. Add : No. 220. ii, Blue Sugar-bird (Dacnis cayana (Linn.)).
In A.M., 1932, 266, Mrs. Dewar Murray records the successful
rearing of one young bird in 1932 ; it was deserted by its
parents when fourteen days old and after that reared by hand
and was five months old at the date of report.
p. 53. Add : No. 230. i, White-winged Myna (Sturnia malabaria
Jerdon). Bred by Ezra in 1932, a " first ", one young one
being reared. See A.M., 1932, 319 ; Medal, 334. More eggs
and young in 1933, but none reared (A.M., 1934, 159).

p. 53. Add: Ruppell's Long-tailed Glossy Starling (Lampro-
tornis purpuroptems (Rupp.) ). Ezra reared two from two
nests in 1933. I saw the first young one in August when it
was about two months old. See A.M., 1934, 160.
p. 53. Add: Purple Glossy Starling ( Lamprocolius purpureus
(Muller)). W. D. Parker in A.M., 1932, 227, reports the
rearing of two young " Purple-headed Starlings " and inquires
if it is a " first ", and in A.M., 1934, 183, Ezra records success
in breeding the " Purple-headed Glossy Starling ( Lamprocolius
auratus ) " in 1933, one young bird being reared. I think
both these refer to the species named above, as " auratus Gm."
was formerly used for what is now " purpureus Muller " ; this
species also comes from Senegal and is, therefore, more
commonly imported than purpureiceps, from Cameroon,
Uganda, etc. However, as I have said before, the identification
of these Glossy Starlings is difficult,
p. 64. Add : No. 282. i, Pale Thrush (T. pallidus Gm.).
No. 282. ii, Japanese Brown Thrush (T. chrysolaus Temrn.).
(.Hybrid record only.)
p. 200. Add : Pale Thrush x Japanese Brown Thrush. Delacour
tells me (1934) that he bred this cross in 1933.
p. 57. Add: No. 251. i, Wood Lark (Lullula arborea (Linn.)).
Teschemaker tells me (in lit., 14th February, 1933) that he
bred this Lark in 1915, rearing one youngster, and that he
sent full details to Cage Birds at the time,
p. 59. No. 260. Great Tit. The references are to Bird Notes, not
the A.M., as given in the entry. The one young bird reared
(out of five hatched) was liberated a fortnight after he left
the nest, as his brothers and sisters had died. This therefore
may be considered as " not full rearing ".

p. 66. No. 295. Redstart. The entry requires amendment. Tesche-
maker did breed the Redstart, but later than Page's note.
He tells me that it was in 1916, that the breeding pair and
one young cock were given to the Zoo, and that he sent
details of the event to the Correspondence columns of Cage
Birds at the time.
p. 70. No. 308. Wren. Teschemaker writes, 14th February, 1933 :
" I bred this species in July, 1914 ; one youngster was fully
reared and remained in the aviary for some time, I never
published any details but propose to do so shortly in the A.M."
I can only hope that this promise will be soon redeemed, and
with it details given of this breeder's many other successes,
so far unrecorded.
p. 71. Add : No. 308. i, Chinese Jay-Thrush ( Dryonastes chinensis
(Linn.) ). A. Silver tells me that this species was bred by
H. Kenway, of Llandudno, in 1932 ; two young hatched, one
reared. The breader in a letter to Silver, dated 23rd July, 1934,
says, " . . . two youngsters bred, . . . one (a hen, I think) . . .
died ... at five weeks ; the other thrived, but went blind
in one eye when some eighteen months old, and died shortly
after. Incubation fifteen days, out of nest and flying well
fifteenth day after hatching ; at three weeks old, the two young
were fighting each other and had to be separated. . . . The
young cock began trying to sing at a month old ... he turned
out a fine singer. The old birds have about completed a nest
this season (i.e. 1934), but no sign of an egg yet. They generally
make and unmake half a dozen nests, before they settle down
to it." With the letter was a photo showing one of the parents
feeding the young cock. (See also A.M., 1934, 304.)
p. 73. No. 318. Spotted Flycatcher. Teschemaker also bred this.
Three young flew in his aviaries on 7th August, 1914 ; they
were all fully reared and formed the subject of an article in
Cage Birds. (T. in lit., as above.)

The record of the breeding of Prince Lucian's Conure given
in A.M., 1933, 44, will have to go, for Delacour tells me that
birds bred by Mme Lecallier were not luciani but " vittata "
(i.e. frontalis V.), and that practically every bird imported as
luciani is " vittata ". He (Delacour) has once had a true

two young birds of this cross.
p. 92. Lovebirds. Add to the entry in A.M. , 1933, 48, the following.
The first breeder in Europe of the Black-checked x Masked
Lovebird cross was H. Moore, of Tadworth, in 1928 ; for this
success he was awarded the medal of the Soc. d'Acclimatation
de France (see A.M., 1929, 21). For this correction I am
indebted to the breeder's advertisement in Cage Birds of
7th July, 1933, and a letter from him later. The cross of course
has often been bred since.
When at Paignton in 1933 I saw two very unusually marked
Lovebirds which had been bred there. No. 1, from Black-
cheeked and Masked parents, had no black at all on the head,
the whole of this area being yellowish-brown. No. 2, was a
true-bred Peachface with an abnormally large extent of pink,
practically the whole head and chest being of this colour.
Another rare colour variety I saw in a West Australian aviary,
a Lutino Lovebird which had appeared among a number
together in an aviary at Fremantle. The breeder unfortunately
did not know which were the actual parents and, equally
unfortunately, I have forgotten which Lovebirds they were,
but I think Nyasa. If the breeder sees this perhaps he will
correct me if I am wrong and also give us details of the
event.

breeding of a hybrid Domestic Pigeon x Stock Dove ; of
two hatched one was reared for a short time after it left the
nest, but as it had defects in the legs was then killed. This is
the only record of this cross of which Silver knows,

p. 121. No. 541. Spurwing Goose. Bred for the first time in captivity
at Whipsnade in 1933. I saw the brood (eleven young) in
August, when they were about a month old. The mother had
retired into the wild to lay her eggs, and the first knowledge
of her success was her return to her mate followed by her
large family. She was, I believe, one of the many birds and
beasts sent by Governor Armitage from the Gambia, West
Africa ; if so she must have been the bird I had for a long
time about my Compounds in that part of the world, and
which I then knew as " Janet ". A full account with a

Blue Snow Gander x Emperor Goose, but he cannot be
quite sure.

New books on birds are constantly appearing, but we have rarely
read one that gave us so much pleasure as Mr. W. K. Richmond's
Quest for Birds, for it is different from the majority of bird books.
The author does not take for granted the truth of all he has read, nor
does he regard as proved the various theories that have been pro-
pounded to account for the actions of birds. He is a very careful
observer and deep thinker and wishes to prove the why and the
wherefore of bird problems before he accepts them as gospel truth.
He would be the first to admit that he may not always be right in his
views, but his arguments, against the generally accepted territory
theory, for instance, are full of common sense.

Mr. Richmond is a keen bird watcher of the type we admire, the
type who delights to find himself on some lonely marsh or heath with
his field-glasses and note-book, who regards it as a red-letter day if he
can see and watch a bird that is new to him. A Black Redstart is
seen and watched in a churchyard in Essex and he is as delighted as
we were when, last August, we saw a number of Black Terns flitting
over a small broad in Suffolk and a number of Bearded Tits in the
surrounding reed-beds. His chapters on bird watching are delightful
and take one to various bird sanctuaries and to a sewage-farm, one
of the best of all places in which to see varieties, while his other chapters
give one much food for thought. Those of us who find great pleasure
in watching and observing our country's birds will derive much enjoy-
ment from reading this delightful book.

Mr. P. D. Cuming has given us a charming series of essays on

doubly attractive by Mr. J. A. Shepherd's delightful illustrations.
Many subjects are dealt, with and every chapter is good reading, in
fact, when one opens the book, it is very difficult to close it again, for
one becomes fascinated both by the author's literary skill and his
knowledge of the ways of beasts, birds, and lower creatures. There is
very much in it to interest all who love the countryside and would
learn more of Nature's problems. The author in one of his chapters
refers to the late Mr. Astley's Hoopoes, described in our Magazine in

the Natural History of our birds. He first deals with the question
as to What is a British Bird ? and goes on to tell his readers about
seasonal changes of plumage, protective coloration, territory, courtship,
nesting habits, juvenile plumage, flight, swimming, migration,
classification, and economic ornithology. We have only space here to
refer in detail to one particular chapter, that headed " Puzzles ", and
there are many of these in the study of Nature's ways. Dealing with
the Owls the author refers to their silent flight, " but the Owl needs
something more than muffled wings. Yet what other aid, or aids,
has he at his command ? Here is a matter for those who have the
leisure, and the dogged perseverance, to investigate." Some have dark
eyes and some golden yellow, but all have an extraordinary development
of the ears, and curiously enough this is not the same on each side of
the head.
The Cormorant and the Guillemot obtain their food in the same
manner ; both are web-footed but the one when swimming under
water uses only its feet, the other its wings.
Why should the Whooper and Bewicks Swans develop a windpipe
too long for the neck, which has to be arranged in coils in a special
cavity in the sternum ? These and many other puzzles are dealt with
by one thoroughly qualified for the task. D. S-S.

THE AMERICAN WHITNEY EXPEDITION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998752958333333" page_id="56219923"  page_num="327" year="" vol="">
I regret that owing to illness I have been unable to answer before the two
letters in the Magazine regarding the Whitney Expedition. As I was the
Individual who opened up the question of the indiscriminate slaughter of
rare birds in the South Seas and the islands around New Zealand by this
\0x25A0expedition, I will, as briefly as possible, state my case.
In the first place I have no wish to give the impression that I have any
personal prejudice against the expedition, neither do I wish to stir up old
mud. My object was to try and do something that would help to put a stop
to the terrible slaughter of birds which is going on all over the world to-day
in the name of Science. Not a year goes by but sees the passing of some rare
and isolated island species. And it was with the object of doing something
to save these vanishing species that I opened up the question of giving,
by British representatives, permits to such expeditions for the wholesale
collection of these rare island species.
After all, the living bird is much better than dozens of perishable skins
in the various local museums in the United States or even a large series in
the New York Museum. It does not matter quite so much as some scientists
think, whether the third primary of a certain species is an eighth of an inch
longer than that of another species from some other island ; to kill a whole
series of birds to prove this is nothing short of a crime. This may sound
rather an exaggeration but it has been done with many species of Petrels.
Few people realize how interdependent the flora and the fauna of these
islands are on one another, the destruction of one means in time the death of
another; for instance, many species of flowering trees are dependent on
certain species of birds for the fertilization of these flowers, the pollen
adhering to the feathers around the beak of the bird and these are transferred
to the other blossoms. Again, certain species of Fruit Pigeons are necessary
for the distribution of the various seeds of forest trees.
Meeting many people in New Zealand, Fiji, and elsewhere, who were
interested in natural history, I heard a great deal about the depredations of
this expedition, especially from Norfolk Island and Fiji. As the parties were
quite disinterested people I have no hesitation in believing their statements.
These allegations I will not repeat or I may find myself brought up to prove
these statements in a law court which I could not possibly do, for besides
living at the other end of the earth I have lost touch with my informants.
I will merely take the species with which I am directly concerned, the
Masked Parrakeet (Pyrrhulopsis personatus) for instance. My object in
going to Viti Levu, the largest of the Fiji Islands, was to try and find out
something about this bird and to try if possible to obtain a live specimen, and
to find out if it was as rare as supposed. I stayed for some time on the island,
going into the forests in the interior and questioning everyone who was
likely to know anything about the bird or its whereabouts, and I have no
hesitation in stating that if not extinct it is nearly so. Now, it is stated
officially that twenty-six skins were taken ; to obtain these many others would
be wounded and others shot would be lost in the dense vegetation. To obtain
this number the whole island was, as I am told in Fiji, thoroughly scoured.
To slaughter this number of birds when the species is nearly extinct is, to
say the least, despicable.

If the expedition would collect this number of Masked Parrakeets, I
am sure that they would have no qualms of conscience when it came to
other rare species of parrakeets on other islands.
As to the small Lory Hypocharmosyna aureocincta which the Curator of
the American Museum says is by no means rare, I would quote the words of
such an authority as Dr. Casy Wood who has made a long study of the birds
of Fiji and who is, perhaps, the best authority on the question : he says
(Ibis, 1926, p. 120) " The pretty little gold-collared Lorikeet, said by
Layard to be only found on Ovalau, Viti Levu and Taveuni, is still to be seen
occasionally on the two last named islands but is probably extinct on the
first. ... I am afraid that this charming little species is vanishing from
Fiji." I have it officially from someone in Fiji who was connected with the
expedition that 47 birds were shot, and I was told that since the expedition's
visit it had not been seen. In spite of journeys into the interior I failed to
find it.
When the expedition arrived in New Zealand their request to collect
there was refused, but on their own admission, as stated in the bulletin giving
the results of their collecting, they had previously collected on the islands in
the Hauraki Gulf, which by the way are all sanctuaries. I also saw in the
pamphlet that they had collected on the Chatham Islands before the per-
mission had been given, as these belong to New Zealand ; and that skins of
the nearly extinct Sand Plover ( Thinornis novaeseelandiae) were taken. On
these islands exist several forms which, though very rare there, are extinct
on the mainland.
Permission was given to the expedition to visit the Antipodes Islands,
to do some restricted collection, on conditions that a responsible person from
New Zealand should accompany them. This person, a well-known naturalist,
was sent down to Half Moon Bay on Stewart Island to await their arrival,
but the ship never turned up and word was sent that they had been blown
out of their course and did not call.
I have it on very good authority that the slaughter on the islands was
awful, especially amongst the Royal Albatrosses which were nesting at the
time, in fact so many skins were taken that they were used as mats on the
cabin floors. If only five specimens of the Antipodes Island Parrakeet were
taken, it seems a strange thing that skins should have been given away to
interested parties : these I have seen. As for the Snipe ( Coenocorypha
aucklandica tristrami), a friend, a keen naturalist who visited these Islands
within recent years, stated that the Snipe was now quite extinct.
As for only two specimens of the Norfolk Island Parrakeet being taken,
I have it on very good authority from several people from the Island that
so great was the slaughter of these parrakeets that for several years after the
visit of the expedition hardly a parrakeet was seen and so scarce was it that
the authorities at once took steps to protect it, a measure which before was
not necessary, and it is only through careful protection that it is not extinct
to-day.
Why should individuals speak so indignantly of the slaughter of the
bird life on the various islands if it were not true. I personally believe it
is true though I cannot actually prove the statements, though I think if
one reads the papers issued by the Museum they will get some slight idea
of the destruction of bird life on the islands. Surely the birds are more
valuable in their own habitat than lying in dozens in the drawers of museums
whether in America or England ? What are the results of fourteen years'

research ? Has the bird life in the Pacific in any way benefited or the general
public at large ? I would say definitely not. The best way to get to know
something about the bird life of a country is to make a study of the birds in
their native habitat and not collect a large series of skins which in fifty years
or so will want renewing. Is the taking of a large number of skins to be
justified because the authorities have been to a big expense ? Surely that
is a very weak argument. If, finally, the expedition is to work for many more
years, as they say they are going to, in the Pacific, all I can say is--
Heaven he]p the birds ! Sydney Porter.
ORINOCO GOOSE BRED AT KNOWSLEY
In Gleanings from the Knowsley Menagerie , J. E. Gray, 1846, there is a
record of the breeding of this Goose; eight young reared in 1844. The
account (text to pi. xv) is based on Lord Derby's notes and begins, " this
Goose breeds freely at Knowsley," but the 1844 success is the only occasion
on which the young were fully reared. E. Hopkinson.

I think perhaps the following account of an Orange Bishop may be of
interest to those who love birds. I have had this bird for eight years. He
used to be kept in an outdoor aviary with a pair of old Budgerigars, but as
he grew older his temper, always spiteful, became worse, and at last I had to
put him in a cage by himself, as he stood over the seed hoppers and would
not allow the Budgerigars to feed. His cage is in a verandah, with a door
to the garden, which is open by day and closed at night. One day he got
out of the cage and was sitting on the top with the verandah door wide open.
I did not shut him up and a day or two later he flew on to a tree outside,
where he sat all day, coming back to feed and to go into his cage at night.
He now flies out every morning when the door is opened, coming back to feed
and in the evening he goes into his cage to sleep.
His favourite haunt is among the raspberry canes. These are in a wire
enclosure, but he has found a way in, but cannot always get out, so in the
evening I go and let him out, and he flies straight home, and I then give
him a mealworm of which he is very fond and knows directly I lift up the
box in which they are kept.
He is now a gorgeous colour, and is very conspicuous flying about the
garden, but he appreciates his freedom, and is not becoming wild, and is quite
able to defend himself against other birds whom he chases if they come near.
One thing I have noticed, we have been having heavy thunder showers,
and he always comes into the verandah just before one begins.

REARING LUTINO RING-NECKED PARRAKEETS

I have been trying to breed lutino Ring-necks (Psittacula krameri) for
eight years, but have only just succeeded in rearing two. Of course I have
had quite a lot of yellow-bred ones here, and some of these were mated to
lutinos. In an aviary, where I generally turn out a lot of young birds before
I am able to sex them, I had two wild-caught lutinos and five green yellow-
bred birds--all living happily together. Not one of the seven birds in this
aviary showed any signs of a collar, so I did not know if there was a cock
bird among them. To my surprise I looked into the nest-box one day in

May and found two lovely yellow young ones. Both were reared, but I did
not know who the parents were. The hen I was pretty sure of, and she was
one of the wild-caught lutinos, but as none of the others showed any signs
of a collar it was not easy to find the cock bird. After all the birds in this
aviary moulted in August I was surprised to find three lovely cock birds
with collars and in perfect male plumage. All the three cocks were yellow-
breds reared here. This proves that these Parrakeets breed before they assume
the adult plumage. The two young ones are a lovely yellow and both are
strong and healthy birds. As I have a good many pairs of yellow-bred ones
now I hope to get a good number of lutinos next year. Alfred Ezra.

PAINTED FINCHES BY THE DOZEN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994069538461539" page_id="56219926"  page_num="330" year="" vol="">
When in Australia last winter, I saw a few Painted Finches (Emblema
picta) in various aviaries from Adelaide eastward, and learnt that in the
previous season quite a large number (one report said sixteen dozen) had been
caught somewhere in North Queensland by one catcher. At Brisbane I met
Mr. N. V. Whitehouse and saw his aviaries, in which were at least a dozen
of these very rare birds. He knew that a great many had been caught,
but could not vouch for the sixteen dozen. When the first were offered him,
the price asked was preposterous, but eventually he was able to get some
at a more reasonable, but still high price. None had been seen for many
years and many of the dealers did not even know the birds. Mr. Whitehouse
has since sent me more details, and these should interest, especially now
that one example at least, a male for Mr. Ezra, has reached England.
He writes to tell me that four of his pairs went to nest the spring after
he got them (i.e. about August or September, 1934), and that eggs were
hatched, but no young reared ; two of the pairs had built again when he
wrote (October, 1934) and were sitting well. He was fortunate enough to
locate the man who caught them and has sent me a letter from him, the
essential parts of which are :--\0x25A0
". . . I have been all over the country they inhabit, and you will only see
them in the Spinifex country right in the heart of the Ranges and gorges.
They mostly live on Spinifex seed, as that is the only thing that grows in
the Ranges. They mostly go in pairs, and never more than five or six
together. They like to water in the rock-holes, where they can hop from
rock to rock to the water. They never go out of the Spinifex country.
They breed at different times of the year, mostly after the wet season. They
always nest in a bunch of Spinifex or Porcupine, a similar grass. You will
find if you put rocks in your aviary for them to perch on in the day, it will
suit them, and plenty of clean sand or grit, as they are always on the ground
most of the day in the bush picking about. I think the Panicum seed is
the best for them."
Spinifex is a coarse stringy grass which grows in the very arid parts and
the " panicum " is a very small millet largely used for birds in Australia, and
I think grown there.
#5 a pair, or #5 a head was what the dealers were asking, and in many
cases getting, for the birds had not been seen for years, and never before
in more than two's and three's. Three pairs were bought to go to Germany,
but whether they arrived or not I do not know, but I have seen no mention
of such an arrival in any of the German Fancy papers I have seen.
