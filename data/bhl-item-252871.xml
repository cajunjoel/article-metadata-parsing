The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.

Origins are always interesting, and the fact that the Avicultural
Society will in 1933 enter upon its fortieth year, points to the desirability
of putting upon record its early beginnings, while any one of the
dwindling band of Original Members survives to do it.
The Society is now a large and important one, but it began in
a small way. It was founded in 1894 by two young men (C. S.
Simpson and H. R. Fillmer) who were intimate personal friends and
who had recently entered upon their professional careers in medicine
and law respectively. They had been bird enthusiasts from child-
hood, and they, especially Simpson, had had a fair amount of experience
in the care of a number of foreign species, but it is doubtful whether
they would have succeeded in making the Society a success without
the co-operation of two older and much more experienced bird-keepers,
Mr. Reginald Phillipps and Dr. A. G. Butler, both of whom were not
only experts on the subject, but had the gift of writing interestingly
about it.
For some years there had been in existence a small Society called
the " United Kingdom Foreign Cage Bird Society ", which issued
a little monthly publication the contents of which were contributed
by the members. This was undoubtedly the prototype of the

Avicultural Society. The originator of this U.K.F.C.B.S. was
Mr. William Osbaldeston, who was also, during its whole existence,
hon. secretary and editor of its " Notes ". He was a north countryman,
with plenty of zeal and energy, but of rather scanty education and
without journalistic ability. The paper issued under his editorship
often recorded interesting facts, and was not deficient in humour of
the unconscious sort, but it had very obvious limitations. Messrs.
Simpson and Fillmer offered to assist Mr. Osbaldeston in his editorial
work, but their offer was declined. They then felt at liberty to start
a new Society, with the knowledge that it must inevitably supersede
the U.K.F.C.B.S., which it speedily did. The old Society was formally
absorbed into the Avicultural in June, 1895. But all honour belongs
to Mr. Osbaldeston for originating an idea which he could not personally
develop.
There was another society, the " Cage Bird Club ", which had an
influence on the beginnings of the Avicultural Society. It had been
formed a year or two earlier, its originator and inspirer being Mr. W. H.
Betts. The purpose of the Cage Bird Club was to provide a meeting
ground for the more cultured section of bird-keepers. It had a guinea
subscription, held its meetings in a high-class London hotel, and
printed its Transactions for circulation amongst its members.
Unfortunately its appeal was very limited and it was inevitably
exposed to accusations of snobbishness. In spite of the ability with
which the Club was managed by Mr. Betts, its life was short, and
probably the Avicultural Society contributed to its downfall by drawing
away its foreign bird section of members.
The founders of our Society were successful in getting the Countess
of Bective to be the first President, and the Hon. and Rev. F. G. Dutton
(a well-known authority upon Parrots) to be Vice-President. A
provisional Committee was formed, consisting of twelve ladies and
gentlemen besides the Hon. Secretary, C. S. Simpson, and the Hon.
Treasurer, H. R. Fillmer. Among the twelve, besides Dr. Butler,
Mr. Phillipps, and Mr. Betts, mentioned above, were the following :
Mr. H. T. T. Camps, who for many successive years judged the Parrot
section at the Crystal Palace Show and who was the owner of a large
and choice collection of the larger Parrots and Cockatoos. He was a

fine type of East Anglian yeoman. Mr. W. Swaysland, the author of
the British bird section of Cassell's well-known Canaries and Cage
Birds . And Dr. G. C. Williamson, the art critic, who kept a number
of species of Owls, but who is better known as a writer on subjects
other than aviculture.
A circular was issued announcing the formation of the Society,
from which I quote the following. This circular bore the names of all
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7951088" page_id="56237259"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
the Committee.
" The number of persons, who, in this country, have taken up
the pursuit of Aviculture (that is, the keeping and breeding of
Birds) has very largely increased of late years, and it is believed
that a Society which should afford its members a means of inter-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.969672875" page_id="56237259"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
changing, and so increasing, their knowledge of this most interesting
pursuit, and of placing this knowledge on a more scientific basis,
would serve a useful purpose.
" The principal means by which it is proposed to accomplish
this end is by the publication of a monthly magazine, which will
be devoted chiefly to the habits and proper treatment of birds in
captivity, but will also deal with their natural history in a state
of freedom, and will introduce points of scientific ornithology in so
far as they bear on practical aviculture."
I think it must be admitted that the foundations of the Society
were well and truly laid, and that its purpose and object, as outlined
in the circular, have been adhered to with but little alteration. There
has been great, very great, development and improvement, but no
revolutionary change has been necessary.
The original subscription to the Society was 5s., with an entrance
fee of 2s. 6 d. The monthly copies of the Magazine were priced at
6 d. each.
The first volume of the Avicultural Magazine contained 128
pages, but being printed throughout in smaller type than that now
used, the matter per page was more than double that in a page of the
present Magazine. The first monthly part, that for November, 1894,
consisted of 20 pages, the subsequent parts forming the first volume
were of either 12 or 8 pages each. Only 200 copies were printed of
most of the parts, and the volume has long been out of print.

The contents of the first number are not very different in character
from that of the present Magazine. In this first part we find an
article by Dr. Butler " On Aviculture in Aviaries ", A paper on the
Skua entitled " The Waterfall Pirate at Home " by Dr. Williamson.
One by Reginald Phillipps called " My Bird Room ". The beginning
of a series on " Rare Foreign Birds ". Notes on " Our Winter Visitors "
by Walter Swaysland. " Egg-production and Egg-binding " by
Dr. Simpson. And some reviews, notes, and correspondence.
Many who became prominent and valued members joined the
Society in its first year, and were practically " original members ",
though not so called. Among them were Messrs. David Seth-Smith,
J. Lewis Bonhote, E. G. B. Meade-Waldo, F. Finn, and C. L. Rothera,
and the Rev. H. D. Astley.
Volume II (1895-6) consists of 191 pages. The articles are printed
in larger type, the original small type being retained for the corre-
spondence pages. Dr. Simpson, who edited the first two volumes,
resigned the hon. secretaryship in October, 1896, and was succeeded
by Mr. Fillmer. Notable contributors to this volume were J. Lewis
Bonhote, Dr. A. G. Butler, Charles L. Rothera, John Sergeant, the
Rev. H. D. Astley, 0. E. Cress well, C. S. Simpson, Reginald Phillips,
E. G. B. Meade-Waldo, R. A. Todd, H. J. Fulljames, D. Seth-Smith,
Mrs. Leslie Williams, the Rev. C. D. Farrer, Aug. F. Wiener, and
W. H. St. Quintin. In two years the membership of the Society had
increased from 52 to 173.
Vol. Ill saw the introduction of illustrations, there being four hand-
coloured plates and two or three in black and white. An extra charge
of 5s. per annum was made for the coloured plates, but these plates
were also issued uncoloured without extra charge. The number of
pages rose to 212. The coloured plates, all from drawings by Frohawk,
represented the Pine Grosbeak, the Ornamented Lorikeet, the Blue-
winged Green Honeysucker, and the Diamond Dove.
Volume IV, like its predecessor, contains four hand-coloured plates,
the birds depicted being the Chinese Quail, the Golden-shouldered
Parrakeet, the White-eared Grass Finch, and the Chinese Zosterops.
Two of these were by Frohawk and two by P. J. Smit. In addition
to contributions from those who had written before, this volume

contains articles by the Hon. and Rev. F. G. Dutton, Chas. Louis
Hett, G. E. Bouskill, Thomas Marshall, W. Landless, Percy W.
Farmborough, A. Savage, and F. Finn.
In Volume V, in lieu of hand-coloured plates, there are four chromo-
lithographs from drawings by P. J. Smit, the subjects being the Rufous-
tailed Finch, the Blue Sugar Bird, the American Siskin, and the Princess
of Wales Parrakeet. The extra charge for plates was dropped, but
the nominal price of the Magazine was raised to 9 d. There was a
slight falling off in the number of pages. Amongst other writers who
first appear in this volume are W. T. Page and A. A. Pearson. The
Society and the Magazine were now firmly established, and the
membership had risen to 265. In 1899 Mr. Fillmer resigned the
Secretaryship and Editorship. Mr. Bonhote succeeded him as Hon.
Secretary and Mr. Cresswell as Editor.
After this lapse of time, it is perhaps not indiscreet to disclose
a small fact in connection with the articles and correspondence which
appeared under the name of Septimus Perkins. The truth is that
there " never was no sich person ". Septimus Perkins was the nom
de plume of a member who wrote also somewhat voluminously on
avicultural subjects both under his own name and, in publications
other than our Magazine, under another assumed name.
[" An Original Member " has consented to his name being divulged.
He is Mr. H. R. Fillmer who, in conjunction with Dr. C. S. Simpson,
laid the foundations of the Avicultural Society nearly forty years ago
and laid them well. We all owe him much for what he did in the old
days and are very grateful to him for the above most interesting
account of the Society&apos;s beginnings. Some of us remember well those
early days and it is a great pleasure in these later days to occasionally
take down the old volumes from their shelves and read of our first
successes and failures, and to peruse again the excellent and very
instructive articles by those who have now passed away.
There was always a certain mystery about " Septimus Perkins
His writings were those of an experienced aviculturist, but no one
seemed to know him. Now the secret is out--he was Horatio R.

This Pitta, the largest and finest of a group of extraordinary and
brilliant birds, was first made known to British aviculture in the
autumn of last year by Mr. Frost, who went specially to the island of
Halmaheira to obtain it. This little known island, by the way, is the
home of another very extraordinary bird which has recently been
made known to aviculturists in this country, namely, Wallace's Bird
of Paradise (Semioptera wallacei). Though several specimens were
obtained, only two, I believe, arrived here. One was purchased by
the Zoological Society but it did not survive long, which is to be
regretted, for the bird appeared to be in the most perfect condition.
The brilliant colouring of this bird can never be reproduced properly
on paper, and the plate, though an excellent one, does not convey the
vivid and " living " colours of the bird as they are in life. The red
of the under parts is like that of port wine with a light shining through.
The white appeared glossy and polished like the finest china. The
poise is very characteristic of the bird. All other plates drawn from
skins or " stuffed " specimens represent the bird in anything but
a life-like position.
It is a thousand pities that the habitat of this bird should be so
remote and the bird itself so rare, for no more desirable denizen of
our aviaries could be imagined. It is to be hoped that Mr. Frost,
who is an old hand at collecting in the Far East, will bring back some
more of the lovely birds, but I doubt it, as the expense of obtaining
them is very great. Pittas are not birds for the beginner in aviculture.
For one thing, no bird is more impatient of cold ; even in the summer
they cannot be kept outside, for the cold and damp of some summer
days quickly gives them fatal chills. They are best kept in small
indoor aviaries where the temperature is never less than 60* F. They
can stand a temperature up to 100* F. ; in fact the hotter it is the
better it seems to suit them.
It is very essential that Pittas should be kept on damp leaf-mould
or good turf, for being ground birds their feet soon go wrong. Kept
under favourable conditions Pittas will keep in perfect health for

many years. I have a Green-breasted Pitta which I have had for over
five years and it always remains in wonderful condition.
When the birds moult, which occurs in August, we give an abundance
of live ant eggs and wasp grub which helps to retain the brilliant
colouring, especially the red which, unless live food is given, fades to
a dull pink.
In regard to the wild life of this bird there is a very interesting
chapter in the Ibis for 1894, p. 501, by Whitehead. He says :--
" This lovely bird we are told by Mr. Wallace inhabits&apos; the rocky
forests of the mountainous island of Halmaheira, where it hops about
with great activity in the dense tangled forests bristling with rocks.
Thinking that the white breast of this Pitta might be caused by the
bird's surroundings, I wrote to Mr. Wallace asking him to kindly let
me know the colour of the rocks amongst which it lives. In answer
to my question whether they were white, he replies: ' . This district
where my specimens of Pitta maxima were obtained was all coral-
limestone, very rugged and covered with scanty shrubby vegetation.
This limestone is always full of holes and small caverns, so that it
would offer patches of almost white or greyish white rock with almost
black shadows. The black is, I think, the more important as being
protective to the bird, when seen from above by birds of prey, while
the white of the breast would also be assimilated to the rock when seen
horizontally by carnivorous reptiles (lizards and snakes) for there are
no carnivorous mammals. I believe the bird is also found in the
volcanic districts of Gilolo but here also there is rugged rock full of
holes and chasms (black) and scanty vegetation.'
It is an interesting speculation whether the continued cast-up
glare from the white rock may have influenced the change of colour
of the breast of this species."
Wallace also mentions this bird in his well-known book the Malay
Archipelago. He says : " My boy Ali shot me a pair of the most
beautiful birds of the East, Pitta gigas, a large ground Thrush whose
plumage of velvety black above is relieved by a breast of pure white,
shoulders of azure blue, and belly of vivid crimson. It has very long
and strong legs, and hops about with such activity in the dense, tangled
forest, bristling with rocks, as to make it difficult to shoot."

In August, 1931, we were all very surprised when several pairs of
this beautiful Parrakeet were captured and brought to Adelaide.
The Governor secured one pair which was sent to His Majesty the
King. These arrived in England safely and were greatly admired,
and caused quite a stir in avicultural circles. The remainder were
purchased by South Australian aviculturists. Some of the Parrakeets-
were trapped west of Oodnadatta, others along the east-west line,
one hen bird was caught by a Hawk and fortunately rescued by a farmer
near Yaninee on the west coast of Eyre's Peninsula ; so it will be seen
that these birds at times are found over a large area of South Australia.
Now that we had at last secured these extremely rare Parrakeets
the questions were : " Have they ever been bred in captivity ? " and
" Can we breed them ? " The first question was answered by the
Editor of the Avicultural Magazine --stating that there was no&apos;
record of the Scarlet-chested Parrakeet ever being reared in captivity.
I was fortunate in securing the hen the Hawk caught, also birds from
both the other districts, so, barring accidents, will be set up for breeding.
The first two pairs of these Parrakeets I purchased were from
near Oodnadatta, one of the cocks was an adult fully coloured bird
(it is my belief that these Parrakeets are not fully coloured until at
least two years of age), the other was a younger bird, only showing
a small patch of scarlet on the chest. This bird was decidedly off colour
when offered to me, no doubt feeling the effects of its long journey.
Knowing that to do anything with breeding I needed at least two pairs,
I snapped up the four birds that were offered without hesitation, and
considered myself very fortunate to have been given the opportunity
to add them to my collection. They were taken home at once and put
in large box cages in the aviary; on sunny days they were placed
outside, but most of the time they were kept in, with the radiator
burning day and night; this was necessary on account of the young
cock looking so miserable, nearly always sitting fluffed up. After

three weeks the good pair was put out into one of the breeding aviaries,
after being kept shut in the house for a week so as to settle down and
become accustomed to feeding there, then their door was opened and
they had the use of the flight. The young cock was beginning to
worry me because he did not seem to improve ; while the radiator
was burning he looked fairly well, but as soon as it was turned off
he was very miserable, sitting fluffed up in a corner. A wire-netting
partition in the box separated the hen, because I wished to give
medicine to the cock bird ; netting was used for partition so they could
see each other and thus prevent fretting. For some time Dimol
Syrup was given, but this did not have any effect. Then Mr. Ron.
Minehin suggested trying a mixture consisting of 3 parts Liquor
Amon-aeet., 3 parts tincture of squills, and 2 parts sweet spirit of nitre.
After a few days an improvement was noticed, a fortnight later the
radiator was turned off and still the improvement was maintained.
I do not know how many weeks this bird was nursed, but it was a long
while. This pair of birds was put out into a breeding aviary and has
not looked back, and the hen is now sitting on four eggs. I have men-
tioned this case to show that with care Parrakeets can be completely
cured.
The aviaries in which these Parrakeets are kept measure 17 by 5 feet
overall by 9 feet high, the house is 5 by 5 feet, with 12 ft. flight in
front; the house has doors so that birds can be closed up, glass sashes
can be screwed to doors if necessary.
The first season no attempt was made to breed. A pair was seen
taking an interest in a log on 4th June, 1932 (ten months after being
trapped), and on 6th June were feeding each other. It appeared as
though they were going to commence nesting as the hen was often
seen hanging on to a log and looking into the hole. The cock appeared
to want the hen to nest in a box that was hanging on the other side
of the flight; he was continually flying on to this box and running
along the top ; then he would go to the front and look in the hole,
occasionally going inside, while doing this he would be calling to the
hen. But she was not to be put off the nest that she had decided on,
and on 23rd June was seen entering the log, sometimes she would stay
there for a considerable time. Just when I thought they were really

going to start it became very wet and cold, and they appeared to give
np all thoughts of nesting. They did not take any more interest in
the log until 12th July, when the hen again visited the same log. On
14th July the cock was feeding the hen. Both were very restless,
continually chasing each other, and the cock still persisted in trying
to coax the hen to nest in the box, but she was determined to take
her own choice. Some mornings the hen would be seen on the perch
inside the house and the cock on the floor running all over the place
very excitedly, all the time chirping and looking up at his mate as if
trying to entice her down with him. This performance occurred
repeatedly and was a very interesting sight. For a day or so the hen
was continually entering the log, but did not stay long at first; after
a while her visits were more prolonged. On 18th and 19th July she
spent most of the day in the log. When I returned home at 5.15 on
the 19th she was off, but within two or three minutes returned to the
nest and remained there for the night, so I was satisfied that she had
now commenced sitting. It was nearly a week before she was seen
again and then for only a few minutes. The cock was very often seen
entering the log to feed the hen, sometimes going right in, but more
often sitting in the entrance and stretching down, when only half
of his tail could be seen.
After they had been sitting a month I felt rather worried
because the hen was still in the log and no sound of young
ones feeding had been heard. I had made up my mind not to go
near them ; it was very difficult to keep away, especially as I thought
something had gone wrong. On 26th August I went for a holiday
and returned on 5th September. The first inquiry on returning was to
ascertain if any sound of young had been heard, the reply was " No ", so
I immediately took the log down, removed the top, and, on looking down,
the hen moved to one side showing two eggs. I then put a stick down
and moved her further aside, but could see nothing else. The log
was then laid on the ground (the top had been replaced) and the bottom
was removed and the dirt was emptied out; amongst this were two
young ones that had died soon after hatching.
While all this was going on the hen made no attempt to leave the
nest, she just went to the top of the log. Fresh wood dust was put

in and the bottom replaced, and the log was hung up again in the
same place* Still the hen remained inside and was not seen for nearly
a week, then only for a few minutes.
No more investigations were made until the 12th October, when the
hen was off. I thought I would see how many eggs they had, and you
can imagine the surprise to find five young ones which appeared to be
fully 10 days old. The hen evidently took no objection to her log being
cleaned out because she must have laid immediately to have young
this size. The day these young were observed was just two days over
five weeks from the day the log was cleaned out, allowing approximately
three weeks to hatch, and the young to be about 10 days old, it will be
seen that no time was wasted. Another inspection was made on

the hen was seen in the log on the other side of the aviary,

the young to the cock. There are two logs and one box inside and
the same out in the flight. The log in which they nested is about 3 feet
long and 4 inches in diameter. This was hanging nearly perpendicularly
on the front of the house out in the flight. Both ends of the log are
blocked and a hole 2 inches in diameter cut 12 inches from bottom,
about 4 inches of wood dirt was put in the bottom.
When this pair failed with their first nest I considered that my
chance of being the first to rear the Scarlet-chested Parrakeet
had gone. Then another pair commenced visiting a log inside the
house, and on the 24th August started sitting in a log similar
to the one described. The hen was very seldom seen, the cock
fed her while she was on the nest. On 16th October the first
young one left the nest, this was two days under two months
from the date of commencing to sit. The following day another one
followed suit. It was very cold weather, so these were caught and put
inside at night and the door was shut to prevent them flying out into
the flight again. On the 18th both returned to their own log ; there
were two other logs quite near that they could have gone in. They all
remained in until the 20th when three ventured out, on the 21st the
fourth came out, and on the 22nd the fifth showed itself. It appears
to me that there are two cocks and three hens (this is being written on

the 23rd October); one cock is showing a considerable amount of
red on the abdomen, a fair amount of blue is showing on the face, the
blue on the cocks' faces is much brighter than that on the hens, the
primaries are dark blue, and coverts pale blue as in the adult. The
other bird, which I think is a cock, has not any red on the abdomen,
but had a few red feathers showing on the chest. The birds that I
think are hens have a deeper green on the chest, the young cocks'
chests have more yellow in the green. They are all well feathered
and are quite strong on the wing. The father does all the feeding now
they have left the nest, while in the nest the hen assists.
The Parrots I keep are principally of the genus Neophema , and
I have been successful in winning the medal of the Avicultural Society
of South Australia for the Elegant, Turquoisine, and Bourke's, that is
for being the first member to breed these species, so naturally I am very
anxious to win the medal for the Scarlet-chested.
These results should prove that there is no harm in allowing
aviculturists to keep these rare Parrakeets in their aviaries.
Note.--27-10-32. The hen which reared young is in the log this
morning, evidently laying again.
[In a later note from Mr. Harvey dated 6th November he writes :
" I am having a remarkable year with the Neophemas , to date have
reared 13 Bourkes, 7 Turquoisine, 10 Scarlets flying and 4 in a log
about 2 weeks old, 10 Elegants in 3 logs (not out), 7 pairs Turquoisine
sitting, 2 of these on second nest. Two hen Scarlets are laying again.
The Bourke-Scarlet cross were infertile. I am not doing any good
with other birds yet."-- Ed.]

BREEDING RESULTS AT THE KESTON
FOREIGN BIRD FARM, SEASON 1932
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999135151515152" page_id="56237269"  page_num="13" year="" vol="">
By E. J. Boosey and Alec Brooksbank
The season which has just drawn to a close has been, on the whole,
a good one for aviculturists.
At the Keston Foreign Bird Farm breeding results have been well
up to standard, and there has, so far, been a welcome lack of mysterious
unpreventable diseases--such as septicaemia--even among the most
susceptible species of Parrakeets.
Our oldest pair of Browns again did very well, rearing eight young--
five in the first nest and three in the second. This pair of birds have
now produced twenty-five young ones in three years and their progeny
have been exported by us to France, Belgium, Germany, and California.
It would be interesting to know how many grandchildren they
possess !
A pair of Stanleys imported amongst other birds from Australia
in February and both exceedingly wild, were put into a secluded aviary
in April, and astonished us by promptly going to nest and rearing
five young instead of at once falling into a heavy moult, as one might
have expected. Stanleys are such beautiful little Parrakeets and,
from the aviculturist's point of view, so desirable in every way, that
it seems a pity they have not, in the past, been more regularly and
carefully bred, making it more possible than it is at present to obtain
good, healthy stock birds.
One great advantage they possess over nearly all other Broadtails
is the striking and unmistakable difference in colour of the two sexes,
the cock's breast being rich crimson and that of the hen brick red.
Thus, even a novice can pick out a true pair of adults at a glance,
A hen Barraband bred here two years ago and, mated to an imported
cock, produced a very fine family of five. A photograph of three of this
brood appeared in Cage Birds some time ago. Another pair reared
four young but the cock, who has the unpleasant and unnatural habit
of treating his sons as rivals in breeding condition as soon as they
leave the nest, murdered the first to emerge--a particularly brightly
coloured young cock--and had to be removed to prevent further

tragedies. The hen devoted herself to the remaining three and did not
seem particularly upset at being a temporary grass widow.
The behaviour of this particular cock is the more extraordinary as
Barrabands are usually quite the most amiable of the larger Parrakeets
and, in a big aviary, will even live in harmony when two or more
breeding pairs are kept together. The cocks hardly ever molest newly-
fledged young, not their own, and will sometimes assist in their early
education. One trembles to think of the slaughter there would be if
one attempted to keep several breeding pairs of Lorikeets or Peach-
faced Lovebirds together.
Barrabands--considered (with Many-colours), in the old days, to
be such impossible birds to keep alive--are in reality so simple to cater
for and such ready breeders, that it seems a pity their many virtues
as aviary birds are not more widely appreciated.
We had very bad luck with one of our pairs of Many-colours. The
hen, having successfully laid five eggs, and when she was just starting to
sit, suddenly became completely paralysed in both feet. She eventually
recovered, but in the meantime her eggs had to be placed under a
mateless hen Stanley, who had just begun to lay an infertile clutch of
her own. Although every one of the substituted eggs hatched she not
unnaturally failed to rear them, especially as they hatched about
a week before she could have expected her own family.
Another pair of Many-colours--a cock bred here mated to an
imported hen--successfully reared five young, among which was a cock
of particularly brilliant colouring. The hens, too, were all very well
coloured, possessing, as we had hoped, a band of brownish bronze on
the upper breast, inherited from their mother who, because of her bright
colouring, was specially selected as a mate for the most vivid cock.
The oldest pair we possess, who have lived in an aviary for about
seventeen years, and whose age when wild caught in Australia is not
known, only reared one young one this year, though last year they had
six. Unfortunately at the end of last season the hen developed a
badly dropped wing--a recurrence of a similar trouble she had some
years ago--and we fully expected her breeding days were over, and were
surprised at their producing even one youngster this year. They are
the most devoted couple and, though they will probably breed no more.

we hope to keep them for many years yet, to live out the remainder of
their lives in peace and comfort. They must by now possess a vast
number of descendants.
Bourke's did quite fairly well. One of our breeding pairs, however,
had trouble with their first nest which succumbed to a form of nestling
diarrhoea when old enough to have their eyes open and be starting
to feather. The cause remained for some time obscure, until the same
thing began to appear in the second nest, in the same aviary. We then
discovered that the parent Bourke's, usually so indifferent to all green
food--except occasionally flowering &apos; grass--had suddenly decided to
eat considerable quantities of dandelion leaves, thistle, etc., and other
more or less laxative weeds, growing in the open run. These, though
apparently quite harmless to the old birds, proved altogether too-
strong when fed to the nestlings, and the diarrhoea ceased when the
run was cleared of all but a patch of flowering Boa annua grass, and the
rest of the brood was successfully reared.
Individual pairs of Bourke's have their own ideas as to what
constitutes the best baby food: some like hemp while others prefer
sprouting oats and ignore the former completely, some pairs too will
partake of much more green food than others.
A single cock Bourke's, graciously lent to us for the breeding season
by His Majesty the King, was mated, in default of a hen of his own
species, to a Turquoisine. Unfortunately the Bourke 3 s started to moult
immediately he was put into an outdoor aviary, while his wife promptly
went to nest and laid five eggs, all of which proved to be infertile ;
but as the cock was moulting so heavily at the time it was hardly a fair
test of him as a stock bird. The Bourke's recovered from his moult
while his wife was sitting on the clutch of infertile eggs and by the time
she was due to lay again was in breeding condition and so attentive
to her that there seemed every prospect of a brood of interesting hybrids.
Tragedy, however, attended this nest, as the hen was found to have died
in her nest-box when she was presumed to be sitting again. She had
laid two eggs. His Majesty's Bourke's is now with one of our young
ones of his own species, bred here this season.
Elegants were again single brooded, as appears to be invariably
the case with this species. Blue-wings., on the other hand, produced

as usual two broods, and it seems extraordinary that two species of
Parrakeets, so very nearly related to each other, should differ thus
in their yearly number of nests. Again, their close relation, the
Turquoisine, differs from both in being prepared to go on nesting
almost to the extent of a Budgerigar.
Our Turquoisines were rather a disappointment as to the number
of young actually reared. The hen of one of the most promising pairs
laying numerous eggs but always deserting them a few days before
they were due to hatch. Some of her eggs were, however, successfully
transferred to a last year's cock Blue-wing X Turquoisine hybrid,
mated to a true Turquoisine hen whose eggs had proved infertile.
These hybrids are rather beautiful, having a vivid blue band across
the forehead, and a large and lovely patch of Turquoisine blue on the
wing. They have, too, the vestige of a red shoulder patch represented
by a few small red feathers which only show, however, when the wings
are expanded. They are a size larger than Turquoisines, and of all
our Grass Parrakeets, they are by far the most friendly and intelligent,
taking the greatest interest in all one does and becoming tame of their
own accord. Their two different voices clearly indicate their mixed
ancestry, though when lively or excited they indulge exclusively in
the bat-like squeakings of a Turquoisine.
Both Swainson's and Red-collared Lorikeets breed steadily the
whole year round. We had a nest of the former fledged on Christmas
Day last year and it looks as though they will do the same again this
year. Some youngsters have just fledged (31st October), the eggs were
laid about July and the young stay in the nest an extraordinarily long
time compared with Parrakeet babies. They are fed exclusively on
our Lorikeet food and an apple a day, canary seed is available in their
aviaries but they never eat any, and no extras are given when they
have young in the nest. We mention this as we believe some people
who try to breed them give all kinds of messy tit-bits which are quite
unnecessary and in all probability bad for the parents.
Two years ago, owing to pressure of aviary accommodation, we
disposed of all our Lovebirds. Last year, therefore, we only had
Peach-faces breeding. These did extremely well. In one of the back
numbers of the Avicultural Magazine a query was asked how

Lovebirds could be sexed. If the pelvic bone of adult birds is felt,
as advised by Miss Knobel for sexing large Parrots, it will be found
to be quite wide in the hen and very narrow in the cock. We have never
known this test to fail but it will not work until the birds have reached
maturity. Next year we hope to breed several more members of the
Agapornis family.
Of the Finches perhaps the most spectacular success was the
Ruficaudas. The hot summer seemed to suit them and all were double
brooded. We finished the season with forty-three youngsters from
five pairs.
Long-tailed Grass Finches proved disappointing through, we
believe, no fault of their own. We tried them in a new sort of open
aviary but their temperament is extremely inquisitive and every time
anything happened outside the aviary, or anyone passed, off they came
to see what was happening, resulting in chilled eggs. One hen had
thirty-two eggs to her credit and not a single young one hatched. There
are, of course, extremes to everything and from sixteen young (produced
by another pair) to thirty-two eggs seems to us to be the limit both
ways. Results from our other pairs were somewhere between these
two points. A Heck's hen brought up a family of four most beautiful
young by herself, her mate succumbing to pneumonia the day the
brood hatched.
The performances of the Zebra Finches were very different from
last year. We reared approximately 500 young from forty-five pairs.
It may be of interest to mention that we have not got a single imported
bird of this species in the place. It has been queried from time to time
whether aviary bred birds breed as well and are as fertile as imported
ones. In our opinion and experience they breed far better provided,
of course, that the parent birds are carefully bred and not allowed
to degenerate. Unfortunately, since they are so extremely simple
to breed, there are undoubtedly small, badly bred specimens offered
for sale. Aviary bred hens, we find, are less liable to egg-binding than
imported ones. Bengalese, as usual, obliged by rearing almost anything
we cared to give them as well as approximately eighty of their own
species. While we write there are still young in the nests. We breed
them during the summer in outdoor aviaries and not cages, and the

young are considerably larger than imported cage-bred stock from
Japan.
Gouldians, as usual, began to manifest a belated desire to breed
at the end of the summer and it is therefore difficult at the time of
writing to say exactly how many will be finally reared. Quite a number,
however, are already fledged and there are more in the nests.
A young hen bred last season moulted out with a blue streak down
the centre of the lilac breast patch and the yellow replaced by greenish
yellow. She is not now particularly beautiful to look at but our excite-
ment can be imagined when the blue streak appeared and we had
visions of breeding a blue Gouldian Finch ! It would have been
interesting to see how the colours would have developed had the bird
been a cock.
The Cherry Finches settled down to domestic matters early in
the summer and although we have very few pairs quite a nice lot
of young were reared, all of which we are keeping as we want to increase
our stock and they are difficult to obtain.
Masked and Bichenos did well but both are rather difficult to suit
with nesting sites and they must be left severely alone in a secluded
corner. The former are rather late starters and it is very often difficult
to get in more than one nest. One pair reared five. The maximum
young we had in any one nest of Bichenos was three. Other species
bred here this season are Silverbills, Fire Finches (at liberty), Diamond
Doves (prolific but very bad parents), and about 2,500 Budgerigars in
all the various colours. We also got a Zebra Finch X Long-tailed
Grass Finch hybrid and though we think this cross must have been
done before we cannot find any mention of it anywhere. 1 Before they
moult they are not unlike young Long-tails with a rather small bib,
but the Zebra Finch penny-trumpet voice. This year we decided to
try a few Waxbills at liberty--Fire Finches, Cordon Bleus, Orange-
cheeked Waxbills, and Golden-breasted Waxbills--all stayed well
and were successfully caught up again at the end of October, with the
exception of the Golden-breasts, which strayed shortly after being
let out. The Fire Finches were found to have bred in the garden and
several youngsters were caught up with the parents and will be liberated

again next Spring when, in addition, we are going to try Avadavats
and Lavender Finches as well as a pair of Shamas, the latter, of course,
at partial liberty. The Orange-cheeks and Cordon Bleus were a pretty
sight feeding on the bending heads of white and spray millet that had
grown up as weeds in the garden and round the aviaries, and it is
extraordinary the joy which seems to be afforded to all liberty Waxbills

It may be of interest to some of the readers of the Avicultural
Magazine to hear of my experiment with Chukor Partridge eggs,
although some may have tried it.
A friend gave me six eggs. I put them under a Silky Bantam hen
--who I knew was a good mother--and I also put one Japanese Bantam
egg under her with the Chukor eggs (I did this in the hope that the
Bantam chick would keep the Chukor chicks from being so wild, as
they always are as soon as hatched). She sat very well indeed, but to my
dismay the Bantam egg hatched on the 21st day and no signs of the
Chukors hatching. However, I looked at them and thought they were
heavy and looked as though they might hatch, having no idea how
long it took for Chukor eggs to incubate. I took the Bantam chick
away and kept it warm and fed it for three days, when I saw signs of
the Chukors hatching and they all did except one. I then replaced
the Bantam chick and kept them in a coop with a run in front of it
on the lawn, and reared the lot. After about three weeks I took the
run away and let them have free range, keeping the hen in the coop

and being careful to move it every day to let them have fresh ground.
They quickly grew and were able to leave the Silky, and now they are
all full winged and perfectly tame and always go about with the little
Bantam, which turned out to be a hen. I regret to say I did lose two,
but not until they were full grown and that was by a dog killing them !
It is most amusing to see the three Chukors always with the Bantam,
and if she leaves them and goes off on her own they get terribly fussy
and excited until they find her.
The Chukors fly beautifully and as a rule roost on the top of the
house. A curious thing is that the Bantam flies as well as they do
and also roosts with them.
They never go very far from the garden, occasionally into the
Park, but always return. Most days they all fly on to the dining-room
window ledge while we are having luncheon, and sit patiently waiting
for bits of bread, and when I go out the Chukors, Bantam, and hybrid
Pheasants (of which I will speak later) always come up to be fed.
They are the most attractive birds and their call quite delightful.
It has been an amusing experiment, well worth trying, and gives one
endless pleasure to watch them.
This year has not been a good one for my breeding birds at Bradley.
I have reared a few Ducks but none of the rarer ones, only Pochard
and Falcated. No Parrakeets have been reared. I think my chief
trouble has been rats. This year they seem to have been very numerous.
They ran about on the tops and sides of aviaries at night and so
frightened the birds off their nests besides destroying many ducklings.
I have reared quite a lot of hybrid Pheasants. My friend Mr. Ezra
gave me a most beautiful Reeves cock, which he said was a murderer
and had killed every Pheasant he could get at on his place, but I
suppose the change of environment altered his wicked ways, as he
has never attempted to do any murders with me. I kept him in the
wallaby paddock and told the keeper (early in this year, about
February) to catch up a few common Pheasant hens out of the woods,
which he did. I clipped their wings and put them with him. They laid
very well and I put the eggs under hens and reared quite a lot, although
I had a great many infertile eggs. I must say they are the most
beautiful birds now they have moulted out. So far a great many have

A curious thing is that a common Rhode Island Red Hen, who

I spent three days in Berlin in November and was altogether
delighted with the magnificent Zoo of the German capital.
If the Small Birds and Parrot Houses are certainly larger and better
stocked in London and in some American Gardens, I believe that all
the other departments are superior in Berlin to those of any Zoo in
the world. The Mammal collection, both in number of specimens
and species, is without rivals in the world ; almost every species
represented is housed in palatial dwellings and bred regularly in spite
of the cold climate of northern Germany. But this is not the place to
talk about mammals. In the bird line the Waders and Waterfowl are
especially well represented and beautifully shown in large, fine, and
practical aviaries and ponds of different kinds. There are many more
individuals and species represented than I have ever seen anywhere.
The Pheasantry is also very good but not equal to that in London.
I can only mention here a very few of the most interesting birds.
In a large aviary, all planted with pine trees and heather, often

much darker than the common Grey Rhea. On the ponds there are
Ashy-headed, Andean, Blue-winged, and other rare Geese ; Eiders,
Crested Mergansers, Steamer Ducks, and two of the rarest species of
Ducks--the Crested Duck ( Anas cristata) and the Andean Teal
(A. oxyptera).
In the Bird House one sees some very rare Weavers and Whydahs,
three Egyptian Plovers (. Pluvianus ), Birds of Paradise, a tame Wood-
cock, many Humming-birds, several in perfect condition, three species
of Mannakin, a large Cotinga (Pyroderus scutatus ), but the real treasures
are two pairs of very pretty little Lorikeets ( Psitteuteles iris ) and
Parrot Finches (Chlorum microrhyncha).
I am afraid that the above lines give a very inadequate idea of the
wealth of the Berlin Zoo. Any bird lover visiting Germany ought not
to miss the chance of admiring this wonderful establishment, which
has been organized and still is most ably managed by Dr. L. Heck
and his son.

Nothing has given me greater pleasure during the last few years
than to see the growth of several provincial Zoological Gardens. The
thought that most bird lovers must share my penchant for other
animals than birds has prompted me to describe one of the latest
additions : I refer to the Chester Zoo.
Passing through Cheshire I called upon Mr. J. G. Lightfoot, a late
Director of this deservedly popular Institution, and it is to him that
I am indebted for help in compiling this article.
These delightful Gardens, situated at Upton by Chester, lie about
2J miles from Chester and are open daily, including Sundays, from
10 a.m. until dark, motor buses passing the entrance. The road is
well signposted for motorists, and I found no difficulty in finding my
way from the lucid directions given me by Mr. Lightfoot.
After passing the entrance lodge, there is ample room in the free
car park both for cars and charabancs, and a pleasant shaded walk

approaches the main building which is a magnificent mansion in the
Tudor style with parquet flooring in walnut and mahogany, over-
looking spacious lawns with cedars and shrubberies.
Should the weather prove inclement music is provided daily,
and there are both cafes and tea rooms. There is plenty of interest
under cover. If the weather is propitious it is possible, after a surfeit
of animals, to indulge in deck chairs or outdoor games should we not
wish to hurry home.
The founder of these delightful Gardens was Mr. G. S. Mottershead,
F.Z.S., who now holds the post of Hon. Curator, supported by a strong
group of directors.
It naturally costs a great deal of money to institute and run a
concern of this magnitude, and the Society has in the past been rather
crippled for funds. Much progress has, however, been made, and the
future now looks very rosy. I understand from Mr. Lightfoot that
since my visit another dozen aviaries have been practically completed,
and this winter a large aquarium is to be erected in the spacious cellars
after the style of the one at the London Zoo.
In another six months' time the feathered population will probably
be trebled as collectors at present in Australia and Central Africa are
expected back about next March.
One of the first aviculturists to take an interest in this Society
was the Marquess of Tavistock, who is well known to my readers.
He has generously donated a very fine pair of Barraband Parrakeets
for whom a fine aviary has been specially constructed.
Arrangements have also been made to commence shortly a series
of lectures (during the winter months) dealing with the various phases
of animal and bird life.
Space, and the policy of the Society, will only permit me to refer
to the feathered inmates, but before doing so I hope that I shall be
allowed a little latitude to relate the following interesting but rather
gruesome incident. A short time ago, in the large outside monkey
cage, a Rhesus monkey deliberately committed suicide in the presence
of several visitors. He obtained, probably from a visitor, a length of
rope with which he played for a while. He then climbed up one of
the large branches, tied one end to this, made a noose of the other.

The first feathered inmates I noticed after entry were a Pelican,
Flamingo, and Black Swan sunning themselves in an enclosure which
also contained Bar-headed Geese, Mandarin and Carolina Ducks and
a Gull. An Adjutant Stork allowed me to enter his large enclosure and
appeared quite friendly. The carnivorous birds included African
Kites, American Eagle-Owls, Long-eared Owl, Tawny Owl, Kestrel,
and Raven. Cranes were represented by a very fine pair each of the
Demoiselle and Crowned, both in perfect condition.
The Parrot tribe was well represented. I noticed seven various
Macaws, Blue-fronted and Orange-winged Amazons, Alexandrine,
Ring-necked and Quaker Parrakeets, Masked Lovebirds, Blue-winged
Parrotlet, Cockatiel, Sulphur-crested and Roseate Cockatoos and
Budgerigars.
Other inmates included a Blue-bearded Jay, Californian Quails,
various Pigeons and Doves, and a very fine Golden Pheasant.
Small Finches consisted of the well-known imported foreign species,
besides Canaries and Britishers, all appearing contented and happy.
In conclusion I would urge upon all bird lovers to support this
venture when in the north of England by paying a visit, and I must
congratulate the Directors upon the condition in which both the
inmates and Gardens were kept.

THE BREEDING OF CABOT'S TRAGOPAN
PHEASANT

By E. H. Lewis
In February of 1932 we received at the Catalina Bird Park, Avalon,
California, three pairs of Cabot's Tragopan or Horned Pheasant
(Tragopan caboti). They had arrived from a dealer in Japan, and in
such excellent condition that after careful examination they were
placed directly into our show pens rather than into our quarantine
department where new arrivals are usually placed for observation.

They made themselves at home from the start, were very quiet and
gentle, and by the 1st April males were displaying, and shortly after-
wards the hens commenced to lay. Only one pair, however, proved
fertile, and from these four beautiful birds were hatched, and matured
sufficiently by the middle of October to show us that they were all males.
A brief description of the pens occupied might be of interest and,
we hope, helpful to those of our members who have Pheasants of this
class. These pens have a frontage of 12 feet, a depth of 30 feet, and are
10 feet in height. The front, the only place from which our thousands
of visitors can view the birds, has a stucco and tile base, 2 feet high,
then 1 in. mesh-wire for 8 feet, and a stucco trim on top. Back of the
pen is made into a tight, open-front house, full width of the pen, and
roofed over for 5 feet, the remaining 25 feet to the front being covered
with inch mesh wire. Sides are 2 feet in base boards, the wire mesh to
top. The ground of the pen is for the front 3 feet covered with clean
building-sand, then 20 feet of greens, both for feed and looks, and is
either grass, barley, wheat, or some succulent feed good for the birds.
The balance of the pen is clean earth, with an acacia-tree planted a foot
from the edge of the green. Each pen is watered by a system controlled
from the outside--one valve watering and sprinkling ten pens at once.
The pens therefore have water, growing green feed, a 10 ft. high tree,
clean earth and sand for dusting, and a tight-fitting house in the rear
for shade and perching. We feel that this combination of room, green
feed, water, sun, and shade provides the birds with as near natural
conditions as can be given them in captivity.
The birds were fed on usual Pheasant grain-mixture, with a little
fruit each day. A box of clean grit and shell was before them always.
For nesting we built a box shaped like a small house, with peaked
roof, inside measuring 18 inches square with a front opening of 10 inches:
this was nailed to the wall about 6 feet from the ground and in constant
view of our visitors. The hen would fly into this box from the tree or
from a perch. A little dried grass had been placed in the box, and the
nest suiting her she rewarded us by laying four eggs and commencing
incubation. She was still very quiet and did not leave the nest whilst
we were inside the pen cleaning or feeding. In about twenty-eight
days--we are not quite sure exactly--each egg had hatched and four

sturdy looking dark youngsters were found with almost fully developed
wings. The next day we made the hen leave the nest, and we carefully
removed the little fellows down to a darkened corner of the pen, the
hen, very much disturbed, fighting our feet; but the moment we moved
away from the chicks she at once went directly to them and had them
all safely tucked away under her before you could count ten. They
stayed in this corner for the first day and night, but the second night
the hen called them to her on a perch about 4 feet from the ground, the
chicks flying to a lower perch first. In a month they were perching in
the tree, some under her and some alongside. For the first four weeks
of their existence they seemed to be constantly under the hen. If they
left her for a few moments her sweet and low call soon had them back
under her in safety and warmth.
We fed them chopped hard-boiled egg, with finely chopped lettuce,
for the first week, then added some " Spratts' " No. 12 Pheasant meal,
moistened with warm water. In a month was added a fine chick grain
and the egg gradually reduced until it had disappeared. A little fruit
was still being fed and the youngsters got their share of it. No insect
feed was given except what they got naturally from the green feed
growing in their pen, but a box of good poultry growing mash was
before them after the first two weeks and they ate a considerable
quantity of it.
The male bird had remained in the pen all the time, but did not
bother nor, apparently, take much interest in them. For two weeks,
however, we fed him first, and then fed the hen and chicks separately
a little distance off. Soon he commenced to notice them, and would
call when he discovered something good to eat. From then on we fed
them all together, and never once did we observe him act in any way
as though he resented their presence. He would call and warn them
exactly like the hen, but at no time would he brood them.
It has been delightful to watch this brood grow up to maturity,
and we feel that the mother hen is entitled to the entire credit on account
of her careful and constant brooding. The hen--and the male bird,
too--never seem to " step " around with the chicks, rather they glide
over the ground slowly and carefully, with the result that the little ones
are not knocked about and trodden upon as often happens when raising

Pheasant chicks with foster-mother hens. We have raised with Domestic
Hens Impeyans, Firebacks, Peacock, Eared, Swinhoe, and other rare
Pheasants, as well as all the more common kinds, and have had all the
heart-breaking failures most Pheasant raisers have met with, including
the loss this season of two weeks' old Argus chicks. If we don't make the
same mistake twice we are satisfied that we are improving. We have
had some delightful and satisfactory results here for which we can
fairly give most of the credit to our wonderful climate. Too much credit
cannot be given to aviculturists who successfully rear young under
the climatic handicaps you must experience in Europe.
We often wonder if, in the rearing of Pheasants particularly, too
much dependence is not often placed on the kind of feed used and too
little on the proper handling of the birds otherwise, such as sanitation,
warmth, protection, and so on. We believe more birds are lost by
improper care than by improper food. Proper food is, of course,
important, but proper care is equally if not more so. If the above
rambling remarks are of interest to our members we feel well repaid
for the effort taken in putting down as nearly as possible all the little
details we have noticed in the rearing of these handsome Pheasants.

Here is a book which every aviculturist will have to read and almost
certainly buy, for it is a complete natural history of this delightful
group of small seed-eaters which appeal to all with their beauty,

drawback is the difficulty of getting so many of them nowadays,
though perhaps that may increase rather than detract from their

seems to have been bred or is being bred in Australia, and in addition
the number of hybrids which have been produced there is surprising.
Two of the plates are given up to these and show about a dozen different
crosses painted from examples bred in Australia. Besides the coloured
plates the book is well provided with photographs of nests, birds,
aviaries, etc., as well as most useful outline maps which show at a
glance the distribution of the different species, and it will surprise some
of us to find how comparatively limited this so often is. Taking
everything into consideration one can safely say that here is the almost
perfect avicultural book and Australia is indeed lucky in having an

delightful book at the price, which (if the same as the author's previous

THE GREAT CRESTED GREBE INQUIRY, 1931 1
The Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps c. cristatus) is one of our most
ornamental and interesting birds, which may be seen on any of the
large lakes or reservoirs of this country, even within a few miles of the
metropolis. It has increased enormously during the last half-century,
and it is difficult to realize that 50 years ago it was threatened with
extinction on account of the craze that was then in vogue for the
wearing of " Grebe furs Legislation came to the assistance of this
bird in 1880, since which year it has gradually re-established itself.
In 1930 two very keen ornithologists were making an ecological
study of aquatic birds in Surrey, which led them to follow up certain
lines of inquiry into the distribution and habits of the Great Crested
Grebe. This proved to be a very large undertaking. A schedule of the
necessary questions was drawn up and widely circulated. Appeals for
help were published in the daily, evening, and local newspapers, and
letters were written to every well-known naturalist, to local observers,
taxidermists, town clerks, and clergy with lakes in their parishes,

and every other possible step was taken to make the inquiry a truly
national one.
The result has been the publication of a most valuable Report,
which gives not only the present status of the Great Crested Grebe
but its complete history and its habits. It is not a dry-as-dust set of
statistics but a document of absorbing interest to everyone who is
*interested in our native birds, and we cannot praise too highly the
thoroughness with which this inquiry has been carried out. It reflects
the greatest credit upon the organizers and their very large body of
helpers.

THE WAYS OF PARRAKEETS

<bodyText confidence="0.999159655172414" page_id="56237285"  page_num="29" year="" vol="">
Birds appear to be in no way inferior to the human race in the totally
unexpected (and unpleasant) things they sometimes do !
For more than eight years I have had a breeding pair of Yellow-ramped
Parrakeets which reached me when about eighteen months old. They have been
the most prolific and devoted couple of Broadtails in my collection. They
have reared literally dozens of offspring and I have never seen the slightest
approach to a quarrel between them, the cock not even making his mate
get out of his way as most of his race and sex do out of the breeding season.
Last July, when their second brood were out of the nest and they themselves
were moulting, the cock suddenly started to bully the hen. The removal of
the young birds and the nests distracted his thoughts and caused him to
behave normally for about six weeks, when he again attacked her and mauled
her badly, so that we had to cut his wing. Fighting is so much part of a
Broadtail 5 s life when at liberty and he indulges in it so often and so
unnecessarily in spite of running no small danger of fatal wounds, that one
wonders whether the monotony of long years of enforced peace with no other
company than that of the wife of his bosom, may not produce some kind of
complex in Ms nature ! The only alternative explanation would seem to be
that X, encouraged by the success of the equally unexpected assault he
inspired the Amboina King to make upon her mate, turned his mischievous
attention to the most model couple in the collection to see how he could
upset the even tenor of their lives !
My hen Brown's Parrakeet, after rearing four fine young ones, fell slightly
ill and had to be taken into the hospital for treatment. Her mate has the
unpleasant personal idiosyncrasy that he always insists on killing his partner
if she has been separated from Mm even for the shortest period, and he has
to have his wing cut to restrain him from Ms unamiable intentions.
This time I thought I would try if by a manoeuvre I could avoid the usual
scene and the infliction of the usual penalty. He had been living for some

weeks with his four children, to whom he has been a model father, so he had
not grown accustomed to solitude. I therefore hoped that if we caught the
young brood, causing him some anxiety and alarm, shut him up alone in the
shelter, released the hen in the flight, and then opened the slide quietly,
he might come out again sufficiently confused by recent events to accept
her as part of the normal menage. If one had been dealing with the
" automaton " type of bird, i.e. with one of those passerines of low intelligence
which react to their immediate environment and, like babies, are not given
to reflection, it would almost certainly have worked, but the Brown's knew
as well as I did the nature of the change when he walked out of the shelter
and met, not his offspring, but their mamma on the threshold. For a brief
moment his better nature almost triumphed. He answered her pleased
greeting with a deep bow and a tremendous display of his lovely violet
shoulders. But a moment later his old crabbed self reasserted itself and he
made one or two spiteful swoops at her, chattering as he did so. Even then
his mind was not fully made up and they soon settled down side by side,
and I hoped that peace would continue. About half an hour later he attacked
her again and drove her into the shelter, coming out himself and settling
down to what was evidently a period of further reflection. Then, very
deliberately and with the air of one who has given a matter full and careful
attention from every aspect, he re-entered his wife's refuge and addressed
himself to the task of hunting her to death ... at which point appeared the
aviary attendant and the scissors.

I was interested to read the notes on Fancy Pheasants in the November
number of this Magazine. Firstly, I notice Dr. Evelyn Sprawson had very
bad luck with his Tragopans. As he mentions, I have never found the cocks
molest the hens in any way and I have had a few pairs of these birds from
time to time. I have always found them most docile. They are my favourite
Pheasants, not only because their colouring is beautiful but chiefly because
they become so extraordinarily tame in such a short time. I never shut my
birds up in their shelter either during winter or summer, and they spend
most of their time in the open, very rarely going in the shed except to dust
themselves. I have never known my Tragopans nest on the ground. They
always like to lay their eggs on an elevation I give mine a box lined with
dead leaves. I consider seven fertile eggs out of nine laid is very good for
Tragopans. It is bad luck only to have reared one. But I know only too well
what disappointments one has with these Pheasants when trying to rear
them. Gentles are undoubtedly splendid for them but given in strict modera-
tion. I give mine custard for the first few weeks. The chicks must have
plenty of liberty, as they are good foragers. I only reared one this year out
of four chicks hatched. I quite think I could have reared two more but
unfortunately we had a very bad storm when the eggs were being sat on by
a Bantam and were due to hatch in a day or two. The poor Bantam was
sitting in water. The chicks hatched all right but there is no doubt it affected
them. They would not eat and the Bantam was not too good in finding
them food. Silky Bantams are splendid mothers but sometimes they are

too good--covering their chicks all day. I had rather an interesting experience
with Tragopans this year. I purchased two Temminck cocks about a year ago-
from Mr. Hampe in Shanghai, both wild caught birds. I mated one with
a Satyr hen which was bred at the London Zoo. She had previously had a-
Satyr cock and proved very fertile. He unfortunately died. I gave her&apos;
a Temminck cock. She laid five eggs and four were fertile. Most
unfortunately the hen has now died. To keep the cock company I have given
him his daughter : she is nearly full grown. I wish it were easier to buy
these birds. Mr. Chapman usually imports some every year about March,,
\0x25A0but most of them arrive in a poor condition though one can usually pick out
some healthy birds. The Monauls which arrive with them are usually
in the same condition. This is no fault of Mr. Chapman. It is usually the
only way one can purchase these birds, from dealers, as they are not good
breeders in captivity. I am hoping that&apos;there are three Temmincks on the
way for me from Shanghai; if so, they are sure to arrive in first-class condition
as they are in very competent hands and not newly caught. I do not think,
there are any Temmincks in Europe except one pair in Italy and mine.
Referring to Mr. Beever's remarks, Tragopans are certainly not so active
as many Pheasants are, but I do not think that this would lead to abnormal
fat. My Argus, Monauls, Imperials, and Mikados are all likewise rather
slow in their movements compared to, say, the Amherst and Golden. I have
never found hempseed harmful but it must, of course, be given sparingly.
I give mine a little once a day--but only a little. I give my Argus a little
sunflower seed occasionally. He loves it. Mr. Beever wishes for more
experience in rearing the rarer Pheasants. I could not refer him to anyone-
more competent than Mrs. Lambert, of Nawton, York. He knows her.
Mrs. Lambert has all my chicks in her care from the day they are hatched,
and what she does not know about it is not worth knowing. She has had most
k inds under her care and I can tell Mr. Beever and anyone else who cares to
know, that there is no royal road to success. You either have good luck
or bad luck--not often the happy medium. When once you have mastered
the feeding you are entirely in the hands of the weather. This past year
the early spring weather was appalling--rain, rain, rain ! Nests and eggs
were floating. I lost several young chicks in this way. Two Peacock
Pheasant eggs were due to hatch during one of the worst storms, both fertile
and both dead. Several eggs which Mr. Seth-Smith sent to Mrs. Lambert
for incubation were destroyed during one storm. Heart-rending, but one
has to put up with it and to look forward to better luck next year.
I will tell Mr. Beever how to get Reeves to lay and to lay fertile eggs.
Give your Reeves 5 cock only one hen. Reeves are not at all pugnacious.
I have never known or heard of a Reeves 5 cock killing his hens. I hope
Mr. Carlton Hunting has succeeded in rearing his Borneo Firebacks, as they
have a nasty habit of dying suddenly when you have every right to consider
them safe. In the course of a letter I wrote to Mr. Hunting, I asked him how
his young Bomeos were, but he did not mention them in Ms reply ! I hope
he has reared them.
I think Mr. Beever is rather pessimistic when he talks of many species
of Pheasants becoming extinct in the near future. I think all Pheasants,
that come from China, and many do come from there, are fairly safe for many

those places, no one better. One hardly ever hears of any of these Pheasants
being imported.
The Bulwer's cock is a lovely bird with his pure white tail (which does not
become pure white until he is three years old). He is truly beautiful and
expensive !
I think the Melanistic should feel a very proud bird after being discussed
and talked about so much ! As everyone seems to think differently of this
bird my advice is, leave him in peace. He has come to stay in our woods,
to be shot at and eaten, so let it rest at that. He tastes quite nice.

COCKATIELS AND GREEN FOOD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975853461538462" page_id="56237288"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
Those who can speak authoritatively on the breeding of Parrakeets,
and have had more experience than I can possibly hope to acquire, generally
recommend the unlimited use of green food throughout the breeding season.
In these days one hears much of vitamins, and whereas one is told that
certain green salads contain practically all the known vitamins in good
quantity, yet the albuminoid value is low.
On this information I conducted a small experiment this season with a pair
of Cockatiels. The aviary was a 20 ft., outdoor, unheated ; the nest, in
both cases, a 6 ft. bottomless tree-trunk standing in the open flight. The
dates given are those when the first of the brood left the nest.
(1) Hatched 16th April; vacated 30th May, i.e. forty-one days in nest.
In this case an unlimited supply of fresh green food was maintained as through-
out the winter, chiefly groundsel and chickweed, yet on leaving the nest all
the young of this brood were unable to fly. There is no question of " French
moult ", within a week they were strong on the wing and perfectly feathered.
(2) Hatched 1st July ; vacated 3rd August, i.e. thirty-four days in nest.
In this case no green food was given for the first fortnight, afterwards in
strictly limited quantities. The brood was larger than in the first case yet
all the young left the nest with good control of their flight.
The birds had been in possession of this aviary for twelve months and had
not previously been in cramped confinement. Fertility was, in fact, excep-
tionally good, all eggs hatching with the exception of one in which the young
died in shell.
There may possibly be another explanation of this curious result, but
until one is suggested to me I shall in future certainly conduct my breeding
attempts with my Parrakeets on the fines of Case (2).

A species of Cormorant which has found flight unnecessary and has
therefore lost the use of its wings is as remarkable a bird as was the
Great Auk, which was in the same predicament. The one is now extinct
and it is feared the other will be soon.
A few days before Christmas, 1932, Lord Moyne returned home
from a yachting trip on which he had visited the Galapagos Islands,
those barren mounds of black lava which lie on the Equator 500 miles
from Ecuador, in the Pacific. He brought back with him four examples
of the large and strange Marine Lizard, five of the beautiful little
Galapagos Doves (Nesopelia galapagcensis ), and one example of the
curious Flightless Cormorant (Nannopterum harrisi), which lives
in one small portion of this group of islands, namely on part of the
coast of Narborough and the adjoining western side of Albemarle.
Darwin visited these islands during his historic voyage of the Beagle ,
in 1835, and gave a wonderful account of their fauna, but he missed
this Cormorant, which suggests that it was scarce even then. It was
not described until 1898, when, a series was collected for the Hon.,
now Lord, Rothschild, who wrote, when describing it, " This bird is
the largest known Cormorant, and its wings are quite soft and incapable
of flight and of about the same size as the wings of the Great Auk."
In colour this Cormorant is dull blackish, a hue that is apparently

common to a good many of the animals of these black lava islands.
It nests among the rocks, and Lord Moyne found two females sitting
each on three eggs.
The specimen that has arrived is a young bird and feeding on live
fish, which it is beginning to take well, in the diving-bird tank. Its
wings, entirely lacking feathers capable of flight, and its huge feet are
clearly seen in the photograph.
This is the first time this Cormorant has been brought alive to
this country, though it has been exhibited in New York.

By J. Delacour
On the whole the weather of this last year has been quite good in
Normandy. The winter was exceptionally dry and bright, although
quite mild, and practically no losses occurred. The summer was also
very fine, dry on the whole, and in this cool valley not too hot, except
for a few days in August. Unfortunately April and May were wet and
cold, and the result was that birds in general, but mostly Pheasants,
laid few eggs and late, or even in some cases none at all.
Only one Darwin's Bhea was hatched early in May, but it obstinately
refused to feed and, in spite of all sorts of attentions, died after three
or four days. Grey and White Rheas, seventeen in all, were reared as
usual without any difficulty. * However, I must warn fellow avi-
culturists to carefully avoid dampness at night with young Rheas.
When about four weeks old, we moved our birds to a fresh field in
which the hut, where they are shut in at night, had no wooden floor,
but one of bare earth instead, and slightly damp. Within a few days
all the young Rheas had cramp and distorted legs and looked like
dying. In haste we put them back into their old pen to sleep on a
dry wooden floor, and in the space of one week they had all recovered.
Owing to the cold weather in the spring some of my good breeding

pairs of Pheasants did not lay as usual. This was the case with Lewis's,
Imperial, Siamese, Firebacks, G-ermain's, and Palawan Peacock
Pheasants. Others, such as my best pairs of Monauls, laid one clutch
only. But we reared a fair number of Mikado, Elliot's, Bel's, Chinquis,
Monauls, Brown and Blue Crossoptilons, and of other less rare species.
It is particularly gratifying to have at last succeeded in breeding a good
number of the fine blue species ( Crossoptilon auritum ), which I imported
four years ago from Kansu, at a great expense, through the kind help
of Mr. Hampe. I have now six pairs and they can be considered as
established here. They are just as strong, hardy, and easy to rear
as the better-known brown Manchurian species.
Another interesting event was the first breeding in captivity of the
Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasant ( Polyplectron chalcurum). A pair of
these quaint little birds purchased two years ago as Mr. Frost brought
them from Sumatra, started laying early in May. Unfortunately the
first clutch was destroyed by the Bheinart's Argus, living in the same
aviary--which, by the way, is the largest compartment in my small
birds' aviaries, 65 by 22 feet, and where crowds of Doves and small
birds live beside the Bheinart's and Bronze-tails. However, instead
of depositing her next two eggs on the ground the little hen Bronze-tail,
which is quite tame, wisely chose for her nest one of the baskets hung
up under the roof for the use of Pigeons and Doves. I was surprised,
on 15th May, to find her sitting. The eggs were at once removed and
placed under a Bantam hen. One was clear, but the other one hatched
and the chick was reared to the adult stage without any more trouble
than an ordinary Chinquis. A fortnight after, two more eggs were laid
in a similar basket; both hatched in due time and the chicks grew
well. One, however, died in October ; the other one was removed to
an indoor aviary where he has been doing very well since.
The clutch of the Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasant consists of two
eggs like that of all Polyplectrons. These eggs are pinkish white,
spotless, and measure about 49 by 30 millimetres. The chicks look
like young Chinquis but are very much darker, almost blackish
brown all over with very dark chestnut markings. They behave
just like any other young Polyplectrons. This year I have moved
my Palawans to that large aviary and removed the Bronze-tailed to

a smaller one, so as to give the first named a better chance to bree
next season.
The Rheinart's had no luck this year : the first two clutches were
smashed ; only one egg each of the other two clutches was fertile and
hatched, but one chick was killed by the broody hen ; the other one
was growing well when, at three weeks old, it died in a few days of some
sort of roup, to which this species is particularly susceptible. The old
pair are magnificent. The long tail-feathers of the cock reached
1-73 m. this year, a length that I have never recorded before in wild
specimens, the average being 1*50 m.
My hen Argus laid many eggs but, the male having an injured foot,
they proved infertile. I have now obtained some perfect birds.
Before leaving the subject of game birds, I have something to say
about the Australian Brush Turkeys. For two years I had been
keeping these birds in large pens with poor results. I started with
two cocks and four hens. Soon each cock killed a hen and last year,
through some keeper's neglect, one male went into the next aviary
and killed the other one. Mounds had been built every year with
suitable materials provided, but no chicks ever came out. Being left
last spring with one cock and two hens, I decided in April to pinion
them and let them out in the park, feeling rather tired of them. It
took them about a month to settle down, but they soon became tame
enough. The male chose a small flat piece of ground in a sloping wood
high up on the hill, and built a fine mound, which he kept up beautifully
till the end of October, changing its shape every day. Only one hen
was allowed to come near, and I am convinced that these birds are
strictly monogamous, as it was already found out in France some fifty
years ago, when they were bred in numbers in a wild state on an estate
not far from Paris. Unfortunately the work had started too late.
The first chicks came out in the middle of September and eight in all
were seen, with a difference of nine or ten days between each of them.
The first two were fully reared without any special food or care, but the
season was too much advanced for the others, and we found them
dead after a few days. We caught the last one, late in October, and
it did quite well indoors for three weeks when it died, apparently
poisoned.

It is very curious that although the mound was well away in the
park all the young ones were seen very soon after hatching near the
bird kitchen, where grain is fed twice a day. I should not be surprised
to find that the cock, who is looking most carefully after the nest and
certainly helps the chicks to come out, leads them to the feeding-
ground before leaving them to their own resources. After the exit
of the last chick the cock took no more interest in the mound and
started moulting ; his head became pale and his yellow wattles dis-
appeared. During the breeding season he was very buoyant but never
vicious to any birds. I hope to be more successful next year as the
birds will certainly start breeding earlier, not being disturbed in the
spring. But one of this year's birds looks like a male. Will the old
cock put up with a rival ?
Most of my Cranes were badly paired up last spring, but by the way
of exchanges and through the kindness of the London Zoo authorities, I
have now a good pair of White-necks and what is probably the last pair
in Europe of Manchurians. Each pair has been given the run of some
fifty acres, with water, and no other Cranes to disturb them, so that
I hope to breed them next season. For the first time here, two pairs
of Demoiselle Cranes have hatched and reared young, one 2 and the
other one 1. A third pair laid but did not hatch. The breeding
pairs left the flock and settled down, one in the garden, the other one
up in the wood. They were wonderful parents and fed the chicks on
insects held at the tips of their bills. They are charming to watch.
The young Cranes grow quickly and must be pinioned at the age of
five or six weeks. In December they still lacked the long tertiaries
and ear-tufts of the parents.
My old Black-necked Crane, the only one ever imported into Europe,
died last summer. A great loss !
The Black-necked Swans reared two cygnets, out of three born
early in March. The Black Swans reared four.
We were rather successful with Geese, the following being reared :

handsome, being white with dark grey markings on the hind neck and
breast, and all the wing feathers with dark grey centres. Needless to
say that I had no intention of producing these hybrids !
Six South African, 4 Common, and 4 hybrid Rajah X Ruddy
Sheldrakes were also reared, as well as about 100 Duck and Teal of
different species ; one pair of Cinnamon Teal produced not less than
nineteen young in three clutches, thirteen of which were fully reared,
the last brood, left to the mother, having met with accident.
A Cotton Teal, unfortunately unmated, kept in a large flight, laid
two eggs.
All the Sea Ducks are flourishing on soaked dog-biscuit and grain,
and of course what natural food they may find. I have had a pair
of Common Scoters now for more than four years and a male Velvet
Scoter for two years. A lovely tame drake Long-tail is doing beauti-
fully and is now in full plumage. No doubt the clear, cold, running
water of the small chalky lake is congenial to these birds.
Through the help of the Berlin Zoo and Messrs. Carl Hagenbeck
I was able to acquire some imported Ruddy-headed and Ashy-headed
Geese which ought to prove most useful for a change of blood, as none
had been obtained in Europe for many years and the stock was
beginning to deteriorate. I also obtained Red Shovellers and Versicolor
Teal from South America.
In the small birds' aviaries a certain number of more or less common
species of Finches were bred, the most interesting being the Madagascar
Weaver ( Foudia ). I kept in the largest flight two pairs of birds that
I brought over in 1929. One pair nested three times last summer
in a privet, rearing four young ones. Of course, as soon as it started
breeding one of the males killed the other one. The Madagascar
Weaver has not been often bred in captivity.
Many Bronze-winged, Jobi, Long-tailed, and Diamond Doves were
bred, and also Budgerigars and Lovebirds.
The indoor aviaries are well stocked at present, with
several Humming-birds, Sunbirds, Motmots, a rare Lagrandiere's
Great Barbet, which I caught in Laos, an American Golden Green
Barbet ( Bucco aurovirens), a lovely South American Ouzel ( Turdus

birds, the old Forktail, a Blue-tailed Pitta, two pairs of Fairy Bluebirds,
caught by myself in Laos, one pair of Niltavas, one of Rainbow
Buntings, one Indian Crested Bunting, and several Mannikins of three
species ( Chiroxiphia pareola, Manacus manacus, and M. ruhricapillus).
These are charming birds, tame and quaint and beautifully coloured.
They do very well on a mixture of cut-up apple, sponge cake, and
and are really easier to keep than many Tanagers.
The results obtained in the Greenhouse Aviary have been so satis-
factory as regards the health and condition of the tropical birds that
I have commenced to build a new one with all double glass to prevent
quick changes in temperature. It will include a highly heated division
for Humming-birds. I hope it will be ready by the early Spring.
It is connected with the present Greenhouse Aviary by a glass-covered
passage.
To put an end to this already too lengthy paper I shall mention
an extraordinarily tame and clever small Troupial ( Icterus croconotus)
which inhabits my room, more often free than in the cage, and
Mr. Fooks' pet Hill Mynah which imitates my voice so well when I call
out " Frank ! " that one never knows whether it is I or the bird that
is calling.
THE BREEDING OF ROSELLA PARRAKEETS
By Walter Voigt, Jena, Germany
In the year 1926 I purchased a pair of Rosellas (Platycercus eximius)
from Gamages for a German fancier. The birds arrived here in perfect
condition and later on changed owners twice before they again came
into my possession in 1929. These beautiful birds spent the winter
in a metal cage 3 feet long, and it was really extraordinary how small
was the food consumption of such large birds compared with that
of the Budgerigar. The principal food consists of sunflower seed,
white millet, canary-seed, spray millet, and as an extra a mixture of

scalded ants' pupae, hard-boiled egg, and a little biscuit. Now and
then they like to nibble at a little maw-seed and oats. The perches of
the cage were very eagerly chewed up, so that they had to be renewed
every week. The birds, particularly the hen, were very wild, but in
time they got accustomed to people, and in May, 1930, the birds were
put into a flight cage, in the open, of the following size : Length,

wood, as is the top, all the other sides are open and covered with small-
mesh wire netting. After the birds had become fairly used to this
cage I gave them a nest-box with a hollowed-out egg cavity. The hen
soon disappeared in the nest-box and she only came out very rarely
to take food. The period of hope began for me now, and I was not
destined to be disappointed. At the end of June I heard the cries
of the young ones in the box but, as I have made it a rule never to look
in the nest-boxes during breeding, I did not know how many young,
there were.
I use nest-boxes of the vertical type--11 by 11 inches and height
18 inches. The entrance-hole is 4 inches in diameter. But this is-
the important point : With boxes of this design I have very often
observed that eggs were crushed by the hen entering too hastily.
The hens jump usually from the entrance-hole on to the eggs. In
order to avoid this I have provided the boxes on the inside with a strip
of wire netting. This wire netting reaches from the hole to the egg
cavity. All hens now let themselves down on this netting. As a
covering on the egg cavity I use one to two handfuls of fine sawdust.
I have also tried to use horizontal nest-boxes, but as yet have had no&apos;
success with these as the birds preferred the usual form. I will y
however, continue my attempts with the horizontal boxes next year.
From now onwards more egg-food was offered and a great deal of
half-ripe grass seed, also half-ripe oats. In the early period the half-
ripe grass seed no doubt formed the chief food of the young, and as soon
as you got near the cage with the bunches of grass, you could see by
the behaviour of the cock how keen he was on this food.
The middle of July three strong youngsters flew out. They were
a long time getting accustomed to people. They dashed about the
cage whenever anyone came near. By avoiding all hasty movements-

during feeding and with the help of a calming whistle the wildness
disappeared. Only the old hen remained wild and is still wild to this
day. There was no second nest in 1930.
After the old birds, separated from the young ones, had spent the
winter again in the cage in an unheated room, they were put back into
the breeding cage in May, 1931. They felt themselves at once at home,
and the hen quickly found the nest-box, and it was not long before
she was sitting tight again. The success in 1931 was two young.
A further three lay like dried-up mummies in the nest-box. A second
brood was also not produced in 1931.
It was now my business to obtain unrelated mates for the three
young birds of the 1930 brood which had by this time become adult,
which was extremely difficult on account of the Parrot ban, but I was
successful in hunting up two cocks ; also I received later a hen from
a mating of Mealy Rosella X Rosella. I had now collected a fine
number of Rosellas. Of these I kept the old breeding pair and also
two further pairs, the rest were sold.
May came round again in 1932. This time I could thus begin
breeding with three pairs. The old breeding pair once more received
the old breeding cage, while I put the two other pairs in two aviaries
situated apart so that the birds could call to one another, but could
not see one another. As in the previous years the old pair at once went
to nest this year. Nor did I have to wait long for the second pair
with the two-years-old hen which I reared myself, whereas the third
pair with my two-years-old cock and the hen (Mealy X Rosella) made
no attempt at nesting as the cock was ill. Later on this hen laid a few
eggs on which she sat very well, but which proved to be infertile. The
old breeding pair had six young in one brood this year, of which,
however, only five flew. The second pair gave me two young. This
year, as previously, the old breeding pair did not have a second nest,
but the second pair went to nest again soon after the young were caught
up and this time four young ones flew. From two pairs I thus obtained
eleven young in all. On the strength of this experience I believe I can
say that the old breeding pair was no doubt imported, and consequently
imported Rosellas only have one nest per year, while with aviary-bred
birds several nests can be expected. I hope in 1933 to be able to

continue breeding with equal success and also to breed then the
Splendid Rosella ( Platycercus splendidus), of which I was able to
acquire three pairs. In addition I hope to breed Pennants and Brown's
and to be able to report my breeding successes in this Magazine.
Together with the Australian Parrakeets I regard the Australian
Finches as my special favourites, as also does my father, and since
1910 many young birds have seen the light of day here.
In case any reader has rare Parrakeets or Finches to dispose of,
I shall be glad if he will kindly offer them to me.

1931, 331, writes that he now has nine blue-bred young
hatched 1929-31, the parents being the blue cock he has
had so long and a green hen ; one at least of the 1929 birds
is a hen, and this should go a long way to the arrival in
the near future of home-bred blues,
p. 89. 383. Bing-necked Parrakeet. Add : Ezra ( same reference
as above) has seven lutino-bred young, but all are apparently
hens, most of whom have laid. Tavistock has this year
(1931) reared two good lutino young from one of his pairs
of lutinos.

young bird. This, according to Prestwich writing in A.M.,
1928, 295, was really the first success, Lewis's occurring
a few weeks later. Shore-Baily in 1926 reared four young
from one nest. The really first success appears to have been
obtained in Germany earlier in 1925 than either of the two
English breeders; see A.M., 1926, 146, and D.G.W., 1926&apos;

France they were bred later in the same year by both
Mme Lecallier and M. Decoux, in each case showing them-

freely and has done so to several generations, the hybrids
breeding true to type.

Nyasa Lovebird. Five reared from two nests by Bennett
in Australia in 1927 ( A.M. , 1928, 301). This was probably
the first success. Since then the cross has been commonly
bred, notably by Whitley who finds the young keep strictly
to type ; he has also obtained further crosses, as the hybrids
are fertile, and this appears to be the case with most, if not
all, Lovebird crosses. Such further crosses were also
recorded by Bennett, viz. the b, Hybrid x Black-cheek
(i.e. three-quarter Black-cheek) and vice versa (i.e. three-
quarter Nyasa). d, Black-cheeked x Masked Lovebird.

a large-sized Masked.

breeder : Tavistock in 1927 ; two young were reared and in
the following February he had more young almost ready
to fly. See A.M., 1928, 18, and L'Oiseau, 1928, 59. Since
then have been bred freely elsewhere. About 1928 the Zoo
obtained a blue cock which was mated in 1929 with a normal
hen, which reared a brood of green young. In 1930 the blue
father was mated with one of his green daughters and more
young (green) were obtained. In 1931 three blue young
and a lot more blue-bred were reared, so now there is a good
stock of probable blue-breeders. See Seth-Smith, A.M.,
1931, 235, etc.

Whitley thinks his first young were earlier and since then
he has been breeding them easily. For a list of Lovebird
hybrids to date see A.M., 1928, 189 ; I think most of these

owing to their multiplicity ; I do, however, feel certain
that other combinations have been obtained, of which I can

birds in May, 1930, when the hen was again sitting on three

they will prove of very great value, and we greatly wish the idea could
be extended to our native birds, in order to teach the growing genera-

THE YOUNG OF THE RUDDY QUAIL DOVE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.84527272" page_id="56237319"  page_num="55" year="" vol="">
Captain Stokes, in his account of the breeding of the Black-capped Fruit
Pigeon by Mr. Whitley, mentions the fact that the young leave the nest when
only a few days old. I have been successful this season in breeding the
Ruddy Quail Dove (Oreopelia montana) and was much surprised when the
young flew five days after hatching. Although they were frequently returned
to the nest, as I was afraid they might be injured by Pheasants, they would
not remain there, except if returned late in the evening, when the hen would
join them on the nest. The young, doubtless, in a state of nature leave the
exposed nest in bush or tree at the first opportunity for the comparative
safety of the ground.

PROLIFIC ZEBRA FINCHES ; FOOD FOR TANAGERS
Last spring I bought a pair of Zebra Finches the offspring of which have
increased to such an alarming extent that I fear my aviary, which is quite
extensive, will be overstocked with these birds, and they continue even now
to keep bringing youngsters into the world. Beyond the fact of catching
them up and making them cease, is there any other way to induce them to
take a rest, or is it best to let nature continue its course ? I shall be very
glad if any of your readers can give me any advice on this subject and inform
me if this is a very common habit amongst these Zebra Finches. I have just
purchased some softbill food which is advertised for Tanagers, etc., but I
cannot induce these birds to look at it. They will only eat bananas and
apparently would sooner starve than touch the softbill food. Have any of
your readers, I wonder, had the same experience ?

Mr. A. Ezra's letter upon " Strange Bird Friendships " is extremely
interesting and reminds me of a White Runner Drake I once had which never
knew he was a Drake--or never wanted to !
I make these following assertions upon my honour as an F.Z.S., although
I do not expect them to be believed.
Some six years ago I sat a Hen upon thirteen eggs. Having only twelve
Fowls' eggs I made up the thirteen by adding a White Runner Duck egg.
This egg duly hatched out, as did nine of the Fowls' eggs. In the next run
separated only by inch mesh wire netting was a flock of White Runners but
" Sebastian ", as we named the hen-hatched duckling, never took the slightest
notice of them. He thought he was, or he was determined to be, a Fowl.
My Runner Ducks and Geese were sent out each morning to a pond some
500 yards up the road. Here they swam about all day and were fetched
home at night. People used to come to their doors to watch them waddling
in single file home to bed. Never once would Sebastian join the throng.
He would not go near the other Ducks, neither would he go near water.
We put him out with the others but he would turn back and quack at the door

until it was opened when he would rush back to the Fowl pen. Several times
I had him carried up to the pond and placed thereon. He left the water
quickly and evidently thoroughly disgusted. He would mate with no Duck
but mated, or attempted to, freely with the Hen. We had to separate him
from them upon this account. Nothing we could do would make him

A SECOND EGG-TOOTH IN YOUNG PIGEONS
For the last two seasons we have reared young from a pair of Grey-fronted
Ground Doves (Leptoptila rufaxilla), and it has lately been observed that the
young possess an egg-tooth on the lower as well as on the upper mandible.
The tooth is well developed and can clearly be seen in the enclosed photograph.
At the time of writing the two young are still in the nest and growing
remarkably fast, as is the case with most Pigeons.
R. R. MmcHiN (Adelaide).
In the Avicultural Magazine of 1908 (p. 341), in describing the
breeding habits of the Partridge Bronze-wing Pigeon ( Geophaps scripta),
Mr. T. H. Newman pointed out the presence in the nestlings of "a white
knob on both mandibles at tip ", and further remarks : " The upper one
is of the usual triangular shape, but unusually large, while the lower one takes
the form of a flattened semi-circular nail. I am not aware that an egg-tooth
on the lower jaw has been recorded in any species of bird, but it is evidently
not so uncommon among Pigeons, as I found it present in newly-hatched
young of the Brush Bronze-wing ( Pimps elegans ), but very much smaller,
and, to my surprise, I could just detect it in two young Picui Doves ( Golumbula
picui) and in a young Diamond Dove ( Geopelia cuneata ). ... It would be
interesting if our members would examine any young Doves or Pigeons
that they may have hatched and report if they find it present. I think the
young of Columba and Turtur have no trace of it."
Subsequently Mr. Whitley discovered a second egg-tooth present in the
nestlings of Oreopelia montana, as recorded in this Journal (1925, p. 277),
with an illustration.-- Ed.

Avicultural Society of New Zealand for 1932 :--
THE PUKEKO 1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978055790697675" page_id="56237321"  page_num="57" year="" vol="">
Until about three years ago the Pukeko (or Swamp Hen) had the doubtful
honour of being classed as " native game 55 . Of course the Pukeko is not a
game bird in any sense of the word, but it was something to shoot. In fact
in this respect they were very popular as they have several characteristics
which appeal to the so-called sportsmen. They may, for instance, be shot
with ease while feeding unsuspectingly in the paddocks. Further, if alarmed
they usually prefer to run rather than fly, this of course gives the shooter
a chance to display his skill: and even.when forced to take wing the flight
is sufficiently slow and laboured to make it an " even break "--for the man.
With so much to recommend it to sporting circles is it any wonder that
a howl of indignation went up when it was placed on the list of absolutely
protected birds ? Reasons for its slaughter came in from every quarter
(sportsmen are found all over our fair Dominion). It destroys Duck eggs
they said. It devours vast quantities of grain. It ruins grain stacks
and so on.
My own observations of the Pukeko feeding among my own crops of millet,
turnips, and oats, I handed on to the Native Bird Protection Society.
These observations absolutely exonerated the bird on my farm, although
they were fairly numerous. At the same time it is possible under certain
circumstances it does do damage, but isolated cases cannot be used as an
argument for wholesale destruction of the bird.
The Native Bird Protection Society brought pressure to bear on the
Department of Internal Affairs, who finally decided to investigate. Con-
sequently between the 5th November, 1928, and 16th September, 1929, a
number of birds were shot in districts where the damage they committed
was supposed to be greatest. The net result of this investigation is
altogether in favour of the Pukeko.
Now as regards the egg-eating habits. I secured a Pukeko and for a
fortnight fed it on green stuff and scraps. Then for twelve hours I left it with
only an egg in the pen. At the end of that time as the egg was still intact,
I broke it and left it in a saucer. Another eight hours went by and the egg
was untouched. As I considered this sufficient test I then fed the bird with
its usual food which it ate greedily.
This does not prove that all Pukekos are abstainers as far as eggs are
concerned ; it does, however, conclusively show that all are not egg thieves,
and thereby another " frame-up " is exposed.
Since writing the above article I have definite information that a number
of farmers who had in the past wanted the Pukeko destroyed are now its
champions and want it preserved, and in places where it has disappeared
wish to have it re-introduced. This bird they consider is one of the best
agents in destroying that menace to grass lands, the grass grub.

BREEDING THE AUSTRALIAN EIRE FINCH 1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999301931034483" page_id="56237322"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
A pair of these beautiful birds first came into my possession in November,
1930. I soon discovered that they were not very easy to acclimatize for the
hen died a few days later. A second hen was procured, but she too went the
way of the first.
In the meantime the cock flourished, sang his quaint but rather pleasant
little song, and became thoroughly hardened, for that winter he spent outdoors
in company with Singing, Zebra, and Chestnut Finches. Moreover, his
conduct left nothing to be desired in spite of the bad character some writers
give them. In fact so far as my experience goes the only " dangerous "
time is when they are nesting.
In August, 1931, I managed to buy another pair. The cock looked fairly
" seedy ", but the hen appeared to be in the best of health. I bought them,
and as I expected the cock died before long. However, I was happy, for at
last I had a pair and what was more they soon showed signs of mutual
affection.
This being the case I decided to give them every possible opportunity
and put them in a well-sheltered aviary by themselves. They soon built
a nest in the only box provided, but to my intense disappointment only
pulled it to pieces a week later. However, before long they recommenced
operations, this time on top of the box, and from then till the time two brown
youngsters with black bills greeted me they never looked back.
Since then I have reared a good many, in fact every bird hatched has been
reared. Four eggs seem to be the average number in a clutch, and the colour
is white.
The nest has two compartments either side by side or one above the other.
The eggs are laid in one, and the male roosts in the other. Incubation is
performed by both sexes.
For food I used canary, white, mixed, and hungarian millets, grass heads,
powdered cuttlefish, and gentles. S. D. Potter.

CUBA FINCHES

<bodyText confidence="0.951186421052632" page_id="56237322"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
It was in February, 1932, I was fortunate enough to get a pair of these
pretty and entertaining little birds. As they were in perfect condition and
the weather favourable, I soon transferred them to an outdoor aviary in
company with Gouldians, Pintailed Nonpareils, Parrot and Singing Finches.
They were immediately at home and commenced building the very next day.
The site chosen was high up in the flight so I had to place a sheet of iron
over the top to protect the nest from the weather.
The nest would be a credit to a House Sparrow and that is about all. It
is large--very large, and made principally of short pieces of hay and vegetable
down. It is completely covered and entrance is via a tube or passage that
runs in up to the nest.
Both parents sat and they are remarkably light sitters.
The egg I did not see, but on the 23rd March, 1932, four youngsters
resembling the hen in colour left the nest.
The food I use is mixed, hungarian, and white millets, canary seed, cuttle-
fish, green stuff, and a few gentles.
Cuba Finches are very active and well able to look after themselves
among larger birds, but they are not quarrelsome and are very hardy.

Extract from a letter received from Mr. H. V. Highman, Hon. Secretary
of the Avicultural Society of Western Australia. This extract is given to
members on account of the information which it contains concerning the
Gouldian Finch
Most fanciers here find great trouble in rearing and keeping this
beautiful Finch. The cold nights seem the trouble. From two pairs I
have this season reared seventeen youngsters and the parents are still
nesting. My aviary is the outdoor ground type 12 by 9 by 7 feet high,
well protected from prevailing winds on two sides and on the other two
sides I hang a tarpaulin on a windy night. The top is half-roofed, but the
Gouldians roost in the open. For nests I use small cigar boxes about 6 by
6 inches with a high, small opening. The old birds I feed on Australian
hungarian millet and canary seed only. Greens in the way of thistle, etc.,
are eaten, but not in any big degree. Seeding grasses are a great favourite.
I forgot to mention, it is my opinion that two pair at least are needed
for success in breeding. I did not have any luck with single pairs. It may
be only fancy, but since keeping at least two pairs I have never looked back.
We have an excellent poultry preparation by name " Merval " over here,
and I use this in the drinking water weekly. I have been doing this for the
past seven months and my losses have been one Avadavat and one Goldfinch.
Naturally I swear by "Merval".
With the young I find the parents maintain them with regurgitated seed,
but I also supplied white ants which were greatly relished. Young reared
on partly insect diet never look back, but reared on seed only they mostly
die at about six months when breaking into colour. I find ants' eggs are also
soon devoured and, of course, the Virol recipe is faithfully applied.
Of course, in your country the extreme cold would be your problem and
I should say you would have to include some heat-giving quality in the diet.
Here the extreme heat is the bother.
I might say I am a great believer in seeing that all Finches roost at night
on a full "tummy". They can then stand the cold better. With our
Finches enteritis is the main bother, but " Merval ", in my opinion, prevents
and cures.
Editor's Note
The preparation " Merval " is not obtainable in New Zealand, but it is
a poultry conditioner as well as a cure for the majority of bird diseases caused
by bad condition of the stomach and intestines. The preparation " Dimol "
is useful for correcting trouble in these organs.

To Hon. Secretary,
Avicultural Society of N.Z.
I'm just going to give you a few additional details concerning our talking
Budgerigar which will probably interest you. I brought him inside the day
following that on which he left the nest, fed him on soaked seed and hulled
oats, and in a few days he was able to crack any seed. He is exactly nine
months old now and first started talking about three months ago. His

vocabulary as yet is very limited but is rapidly extending, especially this
last week or two.
As you stated, he calls " Budgie, Budgie " when wanting to draw attention
to himself, also says " Pretty Budgie " ; " Hullo, Budgie " ; " Come on.
Budgie " ; " Scratch Budgie". He is also good at imitating a whistle, and
recently I brought a young cock Canary inside and Budgie is real good at
imitating him. The only trouble with him is that I can't guarantee him to
talk at any particular time, such as w T hen a visitor comes to hear him. Some-
times I can't get him to talk when I want him while at other times he sits
talking away to himself when nobody is listening to him.
Recently he seems to have become particularly attached to my little
daughter aged eleven, and at mealtimes is generally perched on her shoulder
trying to participate in every bite she puts in her mouth. Immediately she
goes to her room at night and switches on the light, he's off through to the
room like lightning, and perches on her forehead while she lies reading. If
he's not there, he's at the mirror talking to himself. Of course, being a small
bird his voice is not too strong. Probably this is enough news of this one
bird, but the members of our household can't sing his praises enough because
we think he's wonderful.

BREEDING THE DHYAL BIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990004703703704" page_id="56237324"  page_num="60" year="" vol="">
The parent birds had been in captivity in New Zealand for over a year
and both were remarkably fit. I gave them a large coco-nut husk into which
they carried very little nesting material. Four eggs were laid, dark green
with large black spots. I wish to emphasize the shortness of time between
the introduction of the coco-nut husk and the laying of the eggs.
In due course three young were hatched on the 8th January, 1932.
Unfortunately two died within the first thirty-six hours, but the remaining
youngster was quite healthy.
The parent birds were fed with any live insects that could be obtained,,
these including spiders, earwigs, centipedes, cockroaches, and mealworms.
A note of interest in regard to the spiders. The parent birds would pull the
legs off and eat them themselves and then pass over the bod}&amp;quot; of the spider
to the youngster.
With the combined efforts of the whole of my family in searching for
insects and the two parents in feeding them to the youngster, the latter
was fully fledged within two weeks and showed the white markings on
its wings.
The Dhval birds are exceedingly clean in their nesting habits, carrying
the whole of the excreta as far as possible away from the nest. The young
one finally left the nest on the 25th January, 1932, and shortly afterwards
became completely independent. After a period of a couple of months,
it is now flying around and is as large as the parent birds, but has a breast,
however, marked just like a Thrush.
I regard the breeding of this Dhyal bird as one of my greatest achievements
as an aviculturist, for I can assure you it was no small effort obtaining,
sufficient quantity of live insects.

A Bill has been introduced in the House of Lords by Lord
Buckmaster which seeks to make it illegal to capture or " keep in
a cage or other receptacle " any bird included in the schedule which
accompanies the Bill, a schedule which includes practically every
bird on the British list with the exception of crows, magpies, and
a few others.
What does this imply ? It means that everyone who has a British
bird in his possession must, if the Bill becomes law, either wring its
neck or turn it loose to starve within six months of the passing of the
Act. It means also that whereas the rich man can keep his foreign
birds, the poor man who cannot afford these can keep no birds at
all unless he is content with canaries.
The keeping of birds is a custom of great antiquity, and everyone
who is prepared to keep birds under suitable conditions should have
every right to do so. Moreover, bird keepers are invariably bird
lovers and take a pride and delight in the health and happiness of
their pets ; and the working man has every bit as much right to keep
his Goldfinch or Linnet as has the nobleman his Cranes or Emus.
That the conditions under which birds are kept and sold in certain
shops in the East End are far from ideal we are prepared to believe,
and if there is any cruelty involved the R.S.P.C.A. should take the

This is a lovely Pitta which was introduced into this country
by the enterprise of that well-known and persevering collector,
Mr. Frost, who brings so many rarities from the Far East. Only
one bird, I think, was imported which, like the Giant Pitta, did not
survive long.
It is a much smaller bird than the above-mentioned Pitta and not
so striking in colour, but at the same time a very beautiful creature.
This bird was offered to me but I did not purchase it, as I was
contemplating giving up all my birds ; but as I kept my Pittas
I rather regret this now.
Macklot's Pitta has a very wide range, being found in New Guinea,
New Ireland, New Britain, and the Cape York district of Australia,
as well as many islands adjacent to New Guinea. I believe the one
which was imported came from New Guinea.
Pittas are my favourite birds and I am seldom without several
of these lovely creatures. When tame they are unusually intelligent
and confiding, and when properly looked after are long-lived.
Most Pittas are semi-aquatic and shallow pans of water should
always be provided for the birds to paddle about in. A rich insecti-
vorous food is necessary ; a poor quality food will not support them,
in fact they refuse to eat it. My birds are fed upon a very good food
mixed by that veteran aviculturist Mr. Frostick, and this is mixed
with grated carrot and hard-boiled egg. This, with an abundance
of live food, keeps the birds in perfect health for years. For some time

past we have been in possession of a true pair of Green-breasted or
Hooded Pittas; one of the birds, the hen, has been with us for over
five years. The other was picked up in a miserable condition about
twelve months ago, but after a few months and after the moult it became
in as good a condition as the other one. Up to the spring of last year
both birds had been remarkably silent, the older bird only at rare
intervals giving out its strange barking call. Knowing how very
pugnacious Pittas are towards one another, we did not keep them
together, but placed them in small aviaries adjoining one another.
Several months ago the birds became very interested in one another,
conversing in a low, wheezing undertone with each other the whole day,
and every now and then giving vent to their loud, barking-like call.
It was very amusing to watch the birds trying to feed each other at
the same time, each with a beak full of mealworms.
Most of the display consisted of bobbing up and down, each bird
drawing itself up to its full height and then quickly bowing down
until the breast was resting on the floor. One morning we let both
birds out on to the bird-room floor, as they were remarkably tame,
just to see what they would do, and a most amusing display was
witnessed.
The birds greeted each other with a very loud, sharp call that we
had never heard before, and immediately waltzed round in a circle,
bowing and bobbing up and down. Then one of the birds would in
turn retire to the end of the room and, with its beautifully marked
wings stretched out and the brilliant blue wing coverts standing out
at right angles to the wings, the blue feathers of the lower back raised
and the scarlet under parts puffed out, the bird would rush at the other
one, nearly knocking it over. This was done repeatedly by each bird
in turn. Now we let the birds out every morning and the display is
begun immediately and is continued for several minutes. Frequently
the birds pair and then return to the respective aviaries. The birds
now know, and are ready waiting by the door as soon as we enter
the bird-room. On rare occasions they caress one another.
Each day the male bird makes a nest in its food pot. This consists
of leaves and fibre from the trays of leaf-mould in the birds' cages.
Dry pieces of grass are also used, which are pulled from pieces of turf ;

Bernard C. Thomasset--Birds in a Dwelling-room
sometimes when one of the birds is pulling a grass stem, endeavouring
to loosen it, it will suddenly remain motionless, as though in deep
contemplation, for several minutes at a time. Doubtless this is due
to some natural instinct which urges them to remain stationary when
disturbed by an enemy in their native forests. Standing still amidst
vegetation a Pitta is well-nigh invisible, as I found out some little
time ago when the hen was frightened during a period of liberty in
the bird-room. She flew straight downstairs through the open door
and away over the trees, and settled in the grass in the middle of the
orchard. Although I knew the exact spot where the bird alighted
and made a diligent search for about half an hour, it remained
invisible. Just as I had almost abandoned the search it took wing
from almost under my feet and sailed off, looking like a huge, brilliant
butterfly, into the grounds of a neighbouring house. After an extensive
search we found her, but she took flight again, circled round, made
a bee-line for the bird-room door, flew straight in through the open
door, upstairs, and into her aviary. This was the first time she had
ever been out !

BIRDS IN A DWELLING-ROOM

By Bernard C. Thomasset
My aviaries are unheated and I have no bird-room, so that each
winter a certain number of birds which cannot stand much cold have
to pass the winter in my sitting-room.
We are told that an ordinary dwelling-room heated by an open
fire-place is unsuitable for wintering birds on account of the fluctuations
of temperature. During the day the room may be fairly warm, but
at night it is sure to be chilly.
This, no doubt, is true ; but, in spite of it, I have found that my
birds do particularly well under such conditions.
It is true that birds are bad for a sitting-room. Cages are bulky
and unsightly, and their inmates scatter seed and sand, and one's
friends and neighbours consider one eccentric, but a sitting-room
does not appear to be bad for birds.

The room which they share with me is about 20 by 18 feet and has
windows to the south and east. It gets all the sun there is until about
3.30 o'clock, but it is in no wise a warm room. I find it most important
to place cages where they will have the maximum of light and the
minimum of draught, and, in an ordinary room, an open wire cage
is difficult to place. All my cages have backs, either permanent or
detachable, and in some positions sides are advisable. Generally, the
best place is at right angles to a window, but not immediately in front
of it.
On January mornings the room strikes one as cold. The
temperature by the window, where the cages are, is only a few degrees
above 40*, but the birds do not seem to feel in the least cold.
A pair of Gouldian Finches and their six September-hatched young
ones never show a ruffled feather, and they are keen on their bath
however frosty the weather, providing it is sunny. Light appears to
affect their spirits more than temperature. It is interesting to note
how much hardier home-bred Gouldians are than imported birds.
A Shama is spending his tenth winter here, and Long-tailed Grass
Finches are quite happy. I find it possible to winter these last outside,
but they certainly look miserable during hard frost.
Lately I brought in a pair of young Diamond Doves. These are
the only birds which feed regularly by artificial light. I often hear
them at their food tin quite late in the evening. The Shama has
a passion for wireless, and will sometimes sing to it late at night, but
I have seldom known him feed after dark. He is, however, a light
sleeper and will accept a mealworm at any hour.

As I am spending three months in this wonderfully fascinating
Egyptian town I send a few notes on the everyday birds which one
sees around one. I am afraid the notes will not have much connection
with Aviculture, as the average Egyptian's only idea in keeping a bird
alive is to cage it, until it is fat enough to eat, and one may see in the

town quantities of Palm Doves, in tiny cages, awaiting this fate.
Being in bad health I am unable to do more than observe those species
which fall under my eye so to speak. I cannot manage, unfortunately,
to get out into the desert wadis and palm-groves where one might see
more species.
As I write (7th January) there is little or no migration going on, and
so the species which one does come across must be looked upon more
or less as residents. Compared with Luxor, the Fayaum, and the more
northerly parts of Egypt, I do not think Assouan can be considered
a good place for birds. The enormous population of Europeans employed
in connection with the never-ending works at the Great Dam, with the
consequent amount of river-craft of all descriptions dashing hither and
thither, not to mention the weekly arrival of one of Cook's Tourist
steamers in Assouan itself, have driven away practically all bird life
from the immediate vicinity of the Nile, though of course in the
migration season, when the hordes of birds of every description are
dashing northwards, there must be many who, at any rate, stop for
a few hours on one of the many islands into which this part of the
Nile is broken up.
However, those which are here are of great interest, and give me
inexhaustible pleasure to watch, and I also marvel that none of the
many delectable species ever find their way into our aviaries. The
native boys are past-masters in the art of trapping and it seems to me
there would be plenty of scope for a collector to bring back a number
of species practically new to Aviculture !
I am wakened every morning by the melodious " huh-huh " from
a pair of Hoopoes who have already commenced to breed under the
roof over my balcony window. I constantly see them flying up with
short pieces of straw, and I well remember when I was here many years
ago digging out a Hoopoe's nest which was almost entirely composed
of short pieces of straw. They are very abundant here, all now paired,
and it is amusing to watch them congregate when the gardener is
watering with a hose the plots of mown grass in the hotel garden ;
no doubt the water brings insects to the surface of the ground. Their
unmistakable note may be heard on all sides.
Quantities of the beautiful little Egyptian Palm-Dove inhabit the

hotel garden and the adjacent public garden. They are not particularly
tame, and I do not think they have started breeding yet. They are
very fond of sitting or walking on the hard garden paths ; one narrowly
escaped a terrible death from venturing too near a monkey chained to
a tree, the Dove got away, but minus all its tail feathers !
From my bedroom balcony I can watch with my glasses a pair of
Hooded Crows constructing a big untidy nest in an acacia tree not far
away. For the last few days while I have been laid up with a cold,
this pair of birds have kept me amused by their breeding proclivities,
love-making and squabbling alternatively. I have taken a large
number of daily notes, which really one day might work up into a not
uninteresting paper. They are, of course, very common here and always
amusing to watch. One of their enemies is the Greater Spotted Cuckoo
and the Crow's nest I have under observation appears to be haunted,
more or less, by one and sometimes two of these birds. Whether the
Cuckoo is parasitical on the Crow I am not certain without a reference
book, but the manner of the former, anyhow, looks very suspicious.
Greater Spotted Cuckoos are not as common here as they are at Luxor,
but still appear to be evenly distributed. They live a great deal in the
sont trees, and as you pass in your motor they fly out, but always two
or three at a time. I have never seen a single one. They are very fine,
handsome birds, and would, of course, make ideal aviary birds, only
the food question might cause difficulty. I believe here they feed
almost entirely on various caterpillars in preference to small lizards,
but there should be no great difficulty in getting them on to a suitable
food in captivity, though I do not remember ever having seen one,
even at the Zoo. By far and away the most noticeable, as well as the
most beautiful of the birds at Assouan at the present time, is the Little
Green Bee-eater which swings like a jewelled pendant from a telegraph
wire or from the end of a spray of acacia, and when two or three dash
off at the same moment to seize some passing insect, the sun reflecting
on their green and gold plumage, they look like some gigantic sun-bird.
They are resident here the whole year round, but the Blue-cheeked and
European species all join them on migration. They have a weak little
note, something like " cheer-wit ", which they constantly utter.
Among other noticeable birds which haunt the hotel garden are

G. H. Gurney--Notes from Assouan
plenty of White-spotted Blue-throats, which, with their long tails held
continuously erect, are often to be seen hopping amongst the shrubs.
A drive into the desert, however short a one, at once reveals the
presence of various sand-coloured Larks and Pipits, but unless I handled
them I would not dare to swear as to their identity. A small flock of
light-coloured birds on the right reveals the whereabouts of a little
company of Trumpeter-Bullfinches, while perched on the larger rocks
stands up bold and defiant the magnificent Black Chat. Their irridescent
black plumage is particularly conspicuous against the pale sand, and
a more handsome bird it would be hard to find. The White-rumped
Chat is also frequently to be seen, but prefers ground which is not of
quite so rocky a nature. There are also certainly two species of pale-
coloured Saxicolas, but again, without a book of reference, I am not
clear as to their identity.
The Houbara Bustard is certainly found in the immediate vicinity
of Assouan, and a native gave me a description of a small sandy-
coloured Partridge, which is found in some of the more distant " wadis "
which can be nothing else but Ammoperdix heyii. Guineafowl and
Sand-grouse are also reported as being resident beyond Shelal, but
I very much doubt whether this is the case, and whether they range
anywhere near this district.
As regards birds of prey, for which Egypt is so noted, I have had
little scope for seeing much in that line. Of course, the ubiquitous
Yellow-billed Kite is always with us, for ever soaring round the hotel
and immediately perching on the three hotel flag-staffs directly the
flags are hauled down at sunset. Kestrels are frequent ; and a splendid
male Merlin dashed out of a sont tree close to me one day. No doubt
various species of Vultures occur ; I have only identified the Egyptian
Vulture.
I have also been prevented from seeing the birds which live around
the Nile itself. I can only mention the more noticeable ones which
have come within my view of observation from my terrace-seat. Buff-
backed Herons, of course, are common enough, but nothing like in the
abundance one finds them in at Luxor and other places. Lesser Egrets
are scarcer. Apart from their different coloration in beak the flight
of these two species is very different and there should be no difficulty

in telling them apart when on the wing. The Egret looks a much
bigger and lumpier bird altogether. An Egret and an adult Egyptian
Vulture passed me flying fairly close in the same direction this morning,
with the brilliant sun shining full on their white plumage. It was
interesting to note that the Vulture looked far more white and brilliant
than the Heron. Pied Kingfishers occur on the rocks in the Nile, but
are much more plentiful all round the Fayaum area, and nearer Luxor,
where there is more cultivation and consequently ponds and streams ;
here at Assouan the desert comes far too close all round, and many
birds very common in Lower Egypt are practically non-existent here ;
two notable instances are the Spur-winged Plover and the Bulbul.
Night Herons are probably common, concealed among the foliage
of the Lebek trees by day, and not stirring till dusk. There are numbers
of small Waders, running about on the sand-banks of the Nile, but
even with glasses it is difficult to identify them. A charming and very
characteristic bird which I had nearly forgotten to mention, is the grey
Egyptian Swallow which is always in evidence everywhere, either
hawking flies up and down the streets of the town, or swinging round
the big boulders about the Nile; I have also noticed one or two
European Swallows. But even from my prescribed area I realize that
Assouan is not a good place for birds : it is far too much shut in by the
desert on all sides, and compared with Lower Egypt the number of
species one sees is comparatively small.

Diseases causing mortality among birds that are commonly kept in

(1) Diseases of the Respiratory System, including (a) congestion and
oedema of lungs ; (b) pneumonia ; (c) bronchitis and bronchopneumonia.

70 A. E. Hamerton--Diseases of Aviary Birds
In the aviaries of the London Zoological Gardens, where my experience
has been gained, the respiratory diseases above named are by far the
most destructive, and affect mainly small species. The lungs of birds
are so closely fixed to the parietes that there is little room for expansion ;
any inflammatory condition is, therefore, often quickly fatal. Congestion
of the lungs may be defined as a condition of active hypersemia of the
organs, that is revealed by areas of deep red, almost purple, discoloration,
which, on compression between finger and thumb, exude frothy fluid.
The portion of lung affected contains some air, and does not sink in
water. The whole lung is cedematous and boggy from oozing of fluid
into the air spaces. On microscopic examination the air spaces of the
lung are patent, but most of them contain some coagulum, leucocytes,
and red blood cells. An extension of this process results in plugging of
the tertiary bronchi and their diverticula with exudate, and consolida-
tion of groups of lobules, which form a patch of consolidated lung that
sinks in water, a condition of bronchopneumonia. Sometimes the whole
of one lung and a large part of the other may be found firmly consolidated
and hepatized, and sinks like a stone in water ; a condition resembling
acute lobar pneumonia of mammals. These conditions come on
suddenly : the bird may appear well in the evening, and is found dead
at the bottom of its cage next morning. The disease is not usually
diagnosed before death, and I know of no treatment. Cold and fog,
or a dusty, stuffy atmosphere appear to be predisposing causes.

Catarrh of the intestines and enteritis are the next most common causes
of death in cage birds. In most cases no specific bacterial or parasitic
cause can be determined, and the distinction between catarrhal inflam-
mation and enteritis is somewhat arbitrary, and depends mainly upon
the intensity of the lesions as seen by the naked eye, or as may be
indicated before death by the character of the diarrhoea from which
the birds suffer. In catarrh of the intestines there is swelling and
oedema of the intestinal mucosa, and in chronic cases the mucosa may
have atrophied and disappeared from portions of the bowel. The lumen
of the gut often contains undigested seeds or sand, and there is always
great excess of mucous exudate. In enteritis the gut is more severely

and more extensively inflamed, and deep red in colour ; the mucosa is
intensely congested and haemorrhagic, with patches of denudation,
sloughing, or ulceration, and a blood-stained exudate, or even blood,
may fill the lumen of the gut. Both conditions are frequently associated
with secondary inflammation of the pancreas and gall bladder, viscosity
of bile, and changes in the liver associated with biliary stasis.
Local ulcers of the gizzard and intestine are not uncommon,
and are frequently caused by the irritation of a foreign body, usually
a piece of wire, which may perforate the walls of the alimentary canal
and cause fatal peritonitis. Idiopathic peptic ulcers occasionally occur
in the gizzard, but more commonly in the duodenum near the entrance
of the pancreatic ducts, and may cause death by perforation,
haemorrhage, or secondary septic processes in pancreas or liver.
Intestinal obstruction and ulceration caused by impaction of chalk-like
concretions of excreta (urates, etc.) in the cloaca, and secondary fatal
septicaemia is a condition to which birds in captivity are liable. In
small birds much the same effect may be produced externally by
stoppage of the vent, due to the accumulation of hardened faecal material
on the surrounding feathers.
Little can be done in London in the way of preventing the respiratory
diseases, for they are climatic in origin, and associated with the presence
of fog, atmospheric impurities, cold weather, and stuffy, dusty rooms.
Much, however, can be done in reducing the mortality from intestinal
diseases, for they, like mycosis and tuberculosis, are to a great extent
filth diseases engendered in cages with dirty perches, sides, and bottoms,
dirty feeding utensils, and feeding with stale food. Wholesome, fresh
food, cleanliness, and the use of disinfectants are the remedies. Troubles
arising from constipation and over-feeding can sometimes be recognized
during life, and successfully treated with household remedies.

Prosectorium of the London Zoological Gardens in 1884. His material
was examined by Drs. Gibbs and Klein, then the accepted authorities
on tubercle bacilli in London. At first the disease was regarded as

leprosy ; later, Klein changed his opinion, and agreed that the disease
was tuberculous. Cage birds of all kinds are susceptible to the avian
type of tubercle bacillus ; but, with the exception of cockatoos and
parrots, they are said to be resistant to the human and bovine strains.
The only mammal of economic importance that is commonly infected
with avian tubercle bacilli is the domestic pig, and it is possible that in
the very rare cases in which man has become infected with the avian
type of tubercle bacillus he has contracted it through the pig. Calves
are susceptible to the avian type of tubercle bacillus, but to a much less
degree. In the Zoological Gardens, a kangaroo was recently found
infected with avian tubercle bacilli in the pancreas, and Stanley Griffith
has reported a similar infection of the udder of a goat.
Although tuberculosis probably attacks every avian species living
in captivity or domestication, it seems to be extremely rare among wild
birds. The authenticated cases on record are so few that they may be
mentioned. Shattock and others described a case in a lapwing ( Vanellus
vanellus) which was captured in Scotland. The specimen is now in the
Museum of the College of Surgeons. Hammond Smith records a case
in a wild kestrel ( Falco tinnunculus). Cobbett found a case in
a Partridge ( Perdix perdix), and Hare, of the Royal Veterinary College,
quite recently described a case in a wild Blackbird (Turdus merula )
caught by a cat in a London garden.
In most birds affected with tuberculosis, the lesions are large and
conspicuous by advanced caseation. The liver, spleen, and intestines
are, in most cases, the organs most severely attacked. Sometimes the
disease may be confined to the respiratory system, in which case the
trachea, lungs, and air sacs may be affected. In these cases it is often
impossible to distinguish the lesion from mycosis, except by
microscopical examination, when the finding of tubercle bacilli is
decisive. I have never found mycotic lesions and tuberculous lesions
co-existing. In records of such double infections I can find no data
regarding microscopical examination, which in certain cases is the
only means of distinguishing between the two diseases. Tuberculosis
of the avian glands (thymus, or lymph glands of neck) is fairly common,
and in fact there is no internal avian tissue or structure, except that of
the nervous system, in which I have not found lesions of tuberculosis.

If an infected bird is introduced, the aviary becomes grossly con-
taminated, and other cases may follow, for the birds pick up the tubercle
bacilli in millions off the ground with their food, etc.
The following case is illustrative : A Crossoptilon Pheasant
(Crossoptilon auritum) died from " enteritis ". Examination with
a hand lens revealed minute white deposits scattered throughout the
whole extent of the intestinal mucosa. Smear preparations of the
faeces were examined microscopically. They resembled preparations
made from a pure culture of tubercle bacilli in the vast numbers of these
organisms revealed. Histological examination of the tissue showed the
deposits to be miliary tubercles in the mucosa and in the intestinal
villi, which were packed with tubercle bacilli. The potential infectivity
of this- bird needs no emphasis.
Another case illustrates localized quiescent tuberculosis : A Jackson&apos;s
Whydah bird ( Drepanojplectes jacksoni) lived in the Zoo for twenty-one
years, when it died from the pressure effects of an abdominal " tumour ",
the size of a filbert nut, that occupied the greater part of the abdomen.
The tumour was enclosed in a fibrous capsule, and contained caseous
material. Microscopical examination revealed masses of tubercle bacilli
in a structureless matrix, with giant-cell systems in the enveloping
capsule. The " tumour " was found to be the spleen ; its proper tissue
was destroyed. No other tuberculous deposits were found in the bird.
Despite the bird's age and destruction of its spleen, its general condition
was good. It was in full nuptial plumage, and the testicles showed
normal seasonal activity. Interesting points in this case are : (1) The
partiality of the avian tubercle bacillus for the spleen of birds in contrast
to the rarity of tuberculosis of the human spleen ; (2) Birds, like man-
kind, can get on very well without any spleen at all.
Mycosis is a common and fatal disease of the air passages due to
infection with fungi (moulds) of the genera aspergillus and penicillium.
It is characterized by the formation of a mouldy growth on the mucous
membranes of the air tubes, and of the air sacs in the thoracic and
abdominal cavities. The disease occurs mainly among exotic birds,
and is probably acquired under the insanitary conditions in dealers'
stores and on the voyage to England. We have seen whole consignments
of birds arrive, crowded together in cages fouled with mouldy excreta,

in which nearly every bird has died from mycosis shortly after arrival.
Aspergillus fumigatus is the commonest fungus causing mycotic lesions
in birds. The primary deposit usually occurs on the inner surface of the
large thoracic and abdominal air sacs, in which they spread and
coalesce, to form a tough, yellowish, leathery, mouldy film, lining the
whole of the inner surface of large air sacs ; or the growth may com-
pletely fill the air sacs of small birds with hard yellow nodules, which
may occur in the air spaces of the lungs, where they cause inflammatory
consolidation, distinguishable from tuberculosis only by microscopical
examination. In some cases the mycotic growth is found only in the
syrinx, where it causes death by choking of the windpipe. The disease
kills slowly, and can often be diagnosed during life by the gasping and
laboured respiration of the birds. When recognized, a sick bird should
be segregated.
(4) Deaths Caused by Animal Parasites .--External parasites are
responsible for ill-health among aviary and domesticated birds that
are kept under insanitary conditions, but they are rarely a primary
cause of death. More than forty species of lice occur among aviary birds.
The common bird flea (Pulex avium) infests many species of birds, and
the red mite is a nocturnal blood sucker that causes loss of blood and
intense irritation. Scaly leg or foot mange is caused by a species of
sarcoptic mite, and another species infests the portions of the quills
that lie beneath the skin, and causes loss of feathers. The fowl tick
infects poultry and Canaries, and carries the fatal spirillum fever of
birds ; fortunately a rare disease in England. Internal parasites may
be dangerous to birds, and often cause death.
The following are common and destructive among aviary birds :--
Gape Worms (Syngamus trachealus) infest the air passages of certain
cage birds, Waterfowl, and Pheasants, and cause death by blocking
of the air passages, or by causing inflammatory conditions of the
lungs.
Round Worms (. Nematodes) are common intestinal parasites, and
sometimes cause death by perforating the gut. The most destructive,
however, are the following :--
Heterakis .--Small round worms from 31-2 cm. in length, easily
seen by the naked eye, infest the caeca of birds, and cause severe

inflammation and gangrene of this part of the bowel. It is a most
destructive disease amongst gallinaceous birds and pigeons.
Spiroptera, or hair worms, infest the gizzard and proventiculous of
Waterfowl and gallinaceous birds, and cause death by burrowing under
the mucosa and setting up severe inflammation.
A Filaria- like worm ( Diplotrixna tricuspis) is sometimes found in
the body cavity of Jays that have died of pneumonic consolidation
of the lungs. This worm causes fatal avian pneumonia by laying its
eggs in vast numbers in the tissues of the lung, in which they can be
readily detected on microscopical examination of the affected organ.
Tapeworms (Cestodes ) are common intestinal parasites of aviary
birds. They do not usually cause disease, except when found in very
large numbers, they may then cause death by intestinal obstruction
or inflammation.
Flukes or flatworms (Trematodes) are sometimes found infesting the
kidneys of Egrets, and possibly other water birds. If in large numbers
they may set up a verminous nephritis, resulting in death from dis-
organization of the kidneys. The eggs of the parasite are readily found
on microscopical examination of the contents of ureters or cloaca.
Microfilaria. --The larval forms of filaria worms are sometimes found
concentrated in great numbers in the capillaries and alveoli of the lungs
of birds that have died from pulmonary congestion and oedema, and
they can hardly be acquitted of being concerned in causing the fatal
lesion.
The air-sac mite (Cytolechus nuedus ) infests the air sacs, and may
cause purulent inflammation therein.
Coccidia are protozoal parasites infesting the intestinal epithelium
of birds. They set up intractible diarrhoea that is most destructive
to young birds. Coccidiosis can be diagnosed only by microscopical
examination of the excreta, in which the characteristic oocyst can easily
be recognized. When the parasites infest the caecal epithelium the lesions
produced may closely resemble those caused by heterakis worms ;
minute inspection with the naked eye or hand lens will exclude the
worm infection.
Other protozoal parasites of birds, viz. those of bird malaria
{Plasmodium) , are of special interest, in that they were studied by Ronald

Ross, who demonstrated their development in the mosquito--a revela-
tion that led directly to the discovery of the anophales mosquito as the
essential insect host of the parasite (Plasmodium) of human malaria.
Avian plasmodia infest the red-blood corpuscles of their vertebrate
hosts, and produce malarial fever, which is a fairly common cause of
death in recently imported tropical birds. Newly imported birds will
sometimes suddenly drop off their perches dead. Post-mortem
examination may show nothing visible to the naked eye : a micro-
scopical examination of the blood, however, will reveal great destruction
of red blood cells, more than half of which may be occupied by a malarial
parasite.
Diseases of the Circulatory System .--Idiopathic anaemia of birds
can rarely be traced to the blood-forming organs. Leukaemia, however,
is a fairly common cause of avian mortality, and is manifested by an
enormous increase of the leucocytes and decrease in the number of
red cells ; associated with pale, watery appearance of the blood,
and a pallid anaemic aspect of all the internal organs. Pericarditis,
with serous or purulent effusion, or a dry form of the disease with
a white film or urate deposit on the opposing surfaces of the sac is
commonly found as a secondary complication of grave primary lesions
of the kidneys, or in general septicaemia. Birds will sometimes die,
however, with the pericardium distended with clear fluid, and a like
effusion in the peritoneum, and no other lesion. There is generally
a history of exposure in such cases. Myocarditis and fatty degeneration
of the heart in old birds is often associated with rupture of the auricles,
haemopericardium, and sudden death. Endocarditis, or valvular
disease of the heart, is quite a common cause of death, and is generally
acute, and often associated with an external septic lesion, such as
septic " corns 53 of feet, or infection of the wound after pinioning,
or other injury. Chronic endocarditis resulting in sclerosis and dis-
tortion of the mitral valves with incompetence and cardiac hypertrophy
occurs in old birds. Patty and calcareous atheromatous deposits in
the arterial system are sometimes so advanced as to seriously diminish
the flow of blood by narrowing of the calibre of the brachio-cephalic
and coronary arteries, a common disease in aged Parrots.

are very subject to nephritis, which is a common cause of death.
In nearly all cases of nephritis in captive birds the inflammatory con-
ditions found appear to have arisen from defects in elimination, resulting
in " renal constipation " and clogging of the urinary tubules and
ureters with semi-solid or solid white concretions of urates. In such
cases the kidneys are usually enlarged, dirty-yellow in colour, and may
show haemorrhages in the soft, friable, and degenerated parenchyma.
The condition is often associated with oedema of the lungs, anaemia,
pyelonephrosis, and septicaemia ; and the serous membranes of the
heart and abdominal viscera may appiear to be white-washed with a
film of urates. Apart from the condition above noted, degeneration
changes, hyaline, fatty, and lipoid, are conspicuous lesions, and affect
mainly the tubular epithelium ; or the tubules may form cysts devoid
of epithelium. There is usually much inflammatory reaction and
proliferation of fibrous tissue in the inter-tubular spaces, and round
the glomeruli ; arterio-sclerosis is not often seen. These conditions
may in some cases be late results of a specific infection that was not
recognized during life.
Diseases of the Generative System , associated with ovarian activity,
cause heavy losses among breeding birds, of which the commonest
is perhaps simple egg-binding. Salpingitis and general peritonitis,
due to the retention of malformed and necrosed ova in the genital
tract, or to the rupture and escape of egg contents into the peritoneal
cavity, are often found.
Diseases of the Liver and Gall Bladder .--Biliary cirrhosis, secondary
to gall-bladder infections in birds that possess a gall-bladder, is not
infrequent, and may be associated with general dropsy of the tissues,
ascites and pericardial effusion. In the case of a Hornbill (Phinoplax
vigil), a gall-stone the size and shape of a date stone was impacted
in the bile duct and was associated with suppurative cholangitis and
biliary cirrhosis. Fatty degeneration of the liver, often associated
with angiomatous proliferation of the blood channels is perhaps the
commonest hepatic cause of death, which usually follows rupture of
the enlarged and friable liver. Abscesses of the liver are generally
caused by foreign bodies perforating the stomach or intestines, or
they may be secondary to ulcerative enteritis. Localized necrosis

of the liver is seen in parasitic infections, heterakis and coccidiosis,
and other specific infections.
Diseases and Disorders of Nutrition. --Severe degrees of osteomalacia
and osteoporesis are very common among young birds taken from
the nest and reared by hand. True rickets with the deformity and
distortion of long bones found in mammals has not vet been seen in
birds at the Zoo. Gout is a common disease among elderly Parrots
that have been systematically overfed. It is easily recognized by
the " chalk stones " deposited in the periarticular tissues about the
joints of the feet and wings, and gouty spondylitis.
Neoplastic Disease. --Innocent tumours, adenomas, lipomas and
granulomas are common enough, and sometimes cause death by their
pressure effects. Hsemangeoma of liver and kidneys occurs, and may
cause death by rupture and internal haemorrhage. Spontaneous cancer
in birds is rare. The following cases have occurred in the Zoological
Gardens : A Bank Myna ( Acridotlneres ginginianus) died from an
acinous carcinoma of the pancreas, with extensive secondary deposits
in the liver. A Gold Pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus) died from an
adenocarcinoma growing from the lower pole of the right kidney.
The tumour occupied most of the abdominal cavity, and apparently
killed by pressure effect.
Diseases of the Nervous System are seldom recognized. Cerebral
abscess occurs rarely.
There are many specific infectious avian diseases, such as psittacosis,
fowl cholera, pullorum disease or fowl typhoid, fowl pox, fowl plague,
and others ; most of them are filth diseases engendered by over-
crowding, dirty aviaries, stale food, and water polluted by excreta, etc.
I have not seen any of these diseases in the Zoological Gardens in
London, and will not describe them, as they occur mostly in domestic
poultry, except psittacosis, which appears to be a disease of cage
birds only.
I apologize to my readers who may have read through this meagre
account of some of the more common and easily recognizable diseases
of cage birds in the hope that they would find some useful guide or
hints for treatment. Unfortunately, I am not a veterinarian, but
a general pathologist, and I have had no personal experience of avian

X Barbary Dove. Whitley tells me that he once reared
this cross " some years ago ", the only success he has ever
obtained though he has paired up many. The father was
a small White Owl-Pigeon. Dr. Podmore in the Cage Bird
Fancy of 29th October , 1932, records two Pigeon-Dove
crosses he has at last obtained after years of experiment ;
one was from a Domestic Pigeon, a very small Blue Rock
mated with a hen Barbary. Two young were reared from
the first clutch, the first time this has occurred in thirty
years of experiment ; usually the breeder found that young
were produced only after long mating, d, Domestic Pigeon
X Turtle-dove. Dr. Podmore (as above) also reared this
cross recently. One young one (a cock) was reared after
the father, a cross-bred Almond Tumbler had been paired
with the hen Turtle-dove for two years. When six months
old the young bird was mated to another hen Turtle-dove,
but whether there was issue we are not told. I had hoped
to have obtained more details of these interesting results,
but to date know nothing more, e, Domestic Pigeon
X Eastern Turtle-dove (Streptopelia orientalis (Lath.)).
One was reared near Tokyo in Japan teste Momiyama, who
says the young bird much resembled the father ( Hachisuka ,

Two races have been bred. First, M. 1. umchall, the Indian
form, by Mme Lecallier in France in 1926 and 1927 ; this
was recorded under the name lusalia, but Delacour says that
that race has never been imported and that the proper name
is (as given here) umchall. See L'Oiseau, 1927, 249;
1928, 364. Ezra reared one young bird of the Haut-Laos
race, M. umchall minor (not swinhoei, as in the original

writing later (A.M., 1929, 27, and 1931, 193) says that they
have never stopped since, and that now he has a dozen or
more. In the list in Aviculture (U.S.A.), January , 1932,
their breeding in the States by Greenshields is recorded
under the name tusalia.

1924 ; in 1925 he sent some of them to Mme Lecallier in
France and H. Bright in England, who both bred them
over here. See A.M., 1926, 223, and UOiseau , 1926, 326 ;

by Dr. Yinsa about 1886, and that the same breeder also
bred S. rostrata and recorded the event in Bull., 1887, 648.

Add : Whitley is very doubtful whether this cross has ever
been obtained this way, for he has paired up many, but
always without result. He once, however, got a success
the other way ; see No. 449 above. He has also at Paignton
a few dark brown Barbary Doves, which have never bred
though he has had them for years ; he presumes they are
hybrid " Barbaries " of sorts though he has no idea what
the other parent (presumably the father) was. He also
has another lot of much lighter brown " Barbaries ", which
do breed regularly, but always produce brown or normally
coloured young with an occasional White, never any inter-
mediate forms. How these originated he does not know,

OBITUARY
WILLIAM HERBERT ST. QUENTIN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990931735294118" page_id="56237356"  page_num="86" year="" vol="">
We deeply regret to have to record the death, which took place
on 21st January, of William Herbert St. Quintin, J.P., D.L., at the
age of eighty-one.
Mr. St. Quintin was the eldest son of Matthew Chitty Downes
St. Quintin, of the 17th Lancers, and was educated at Eton and Christ
Church College, Oxford. He married in 1885, Violet Helen, second
daughter of the Hon. Cecil Duncombe, of Nawton Orange, York.
Throughout his long life Mr. St. Quintin was devoted to natural
history in all its branches, though ornithology and entomology were
his favourite subjects. He was an original member of the Avicultural
Society, and in its early days contributed many valuable articles to the
Magazine. His home, Scampston Hall, in Yorkshire, was full of interest
for those who were fond of live birds, for it was surrounded with large
paddocks in which were Cranes, Bustards, Grouse, Pheasants of many
species, Secretary Birds, and many others. A large lake in the grounds
was covered with Waterfowl of many species, and his aviaries contained
a large collection of the Birds of Prey, Owls, and the smaller birds. He
was also a great gardener, and very many rare plants and shrubs from
all parts of the world thrived in his grounds, and he knew the name and
habits of each.
Mr. E. G. B. Meade-Waldo writes of him : " Yes, St. Quintin's death
is a great grief and loss to me. We have been the greatest friends ever
since our schooldays in 1869, but more especially since 1880, when I took
up Falconry with him. He was the best all-round field naturalist,
and especially ornithologist, I ever met. So far as I know he is the only
one who has bred the Little Bustard, and he was the first to breed the
Roller and the Tragopans. He was a first-rate entomologist and
wonderful at breeding and rearing through all their stages all kinds of
insects ; and was also most successful in taming lizards, etc. The
Avicultural and Zoological Societies owe him much as do also the
London Parks, to which he has given many rare Waterfowl."
All of us who knew him will remember him as one of the most
delightful and lovable of men, who was always ready to place his vast
store of knowledge at the disposal of others. D. S-S.

THE DISEASES OF CAGE BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.947498757575758" page_id="56237357"  page_num="87" year="" vol="">
The study of birds in captivity, be they domestic birds such as
Canaries, Poultry, and Pigeons, or the undomesticated forms dealt
with by aviculturists, has never been more popular than it is at the
present time, but little has been done in the scientific study of the
diseases of birds and their treatment.
The matter has been under consideration by the Royal Veterinary
College, the Governors of which are determined to try to provide the
required services and for this purpose have prepared plans for the
establishment of a laboratory.
This laboratory is designed for two purposes : firstly, to conduct
research by whole-time trained scientists into diseases of fur-bearing
animals and birds ; secondly, to serve as a centre of instruction to
veterinary students and of assistance for veterinary practitioners.
The veterinary surgeons of Great Britain desire the facilities and
guidance of a laboratory which will enable them to give personal
service to breeders on the treatment and prevention of disease in
small stock.
Such a laboratory should eventually be of great service to
aviculturists who are asked to help with their donations to make this
scheme possible.
Professor Tom Hare writes :--
" Sir Frederick Hobday has instructed me to say that if #2,000
can be obtained by next July a start will be made with the research ;
at present a little over #600 has been subscribed towards the fund.
You will note that the object of the Royal Veterinary College is to build
up a large laboratory confined to research on diseases of small fur-
bearing animals, Pigeons, and aviary birds.
" During the last four years I have become familiar with many~of
the problems troubling owners of aviaries, and though I and my
colleague have already published our research on two diseases, we
recognize it is impossible to cope with the demand on our present
limitations of staff and finance. The work already referred to has
been done in our spare time, and I am sure you yourself will appreciate

that the many urgent problems concerning aviculturists demand the
energies of a whole-time trained pathologist.
" We had expressed to Miss Knobel the hope that your Council
and yourself would consent to making known the objects of this appeal
and the urgent need for endowing the research, so that Sir Frederick
Hobday might approach your members with the assurance that
through the Avicultural Magazine your Council had expressed
their approval and support of the appeal.
" I should like to emphasize, in order to prevent any misunder-
standing, that we have no desire or intention to divert material for
examination from the laboratory of your own society ; on the contrary
it is our desire to expand wherever possible all services devoted to
the study and control of disease in birds. For some years past the
students of the College have been trained in the diseases of birds and
already there are scattered about the country a number of veterinary
practitioners devoting their attention to this branch of veterinary
practice. We think it essential that aviculturists should ultimately
have the opportunity of consulting veterinary surgeons familiar with
the owner's problems and with the conditions obtaining in the locality,
thus eventually we hope to build up the veterinary services for bird
owners comparable to that available for the owners of agricultural
stock, dogs, and cats."
The Editor of Cage Birds has consented to receive subscriptions
towards this object, and they should be sent to him at 4 Carmelite
Street, E.C. 4, marked " Veterinary Research Laboratory Fund ".
The Veterinary Journal for January, 1933, is chiefly devoted to
Fur-bearing Animals and Cage Birds and contains a valuable article
on Diseases of Aviary Birds by Colonel A. E. Hamerton, M.R.C.S.,
Pathologist to the Zoological Society. By permission of the author
and editor we are reprinting this in the present number of the
Avicultural Magazine. Another article of special interest to our
members deals with Rickets in Parrakeets and is from the pen of the
Marquess of Tavistock.

up to the present purchased the Index Guide to the past numbers of
the Magazine. This Index was compiled by Dr. Hopkinson, to whom
the members owe much for the great amount of time and labour he
put into its production. It is a most valuable addition to the series
of the Magazine and is of the greatest assistance to aviculturists as
a reference guide to what has been published on any particular species.
I would especially ask our members one and all to add this useful
volume to their series of the Magazine. It can be obtained from

The first volume of Aviculture, which was published by the Society
in 1925, dealt with the Passeres, including the majority of those species
of birds which chiefly appeal to aviculturists. The demand for this
work exceeded all expectations, and it was soon out of print. The
demand continues, and the Council has decided to publish a revised
edition, brought completely up-to-date, if sufficient applications for it
are received to justify the cost of production. An order form was circulated
with the February number, and is repeated with the present issue, and
those who would like the book are asked to sign the form forthwith (if
they have not already done so), and forward it to the publishers. Their
remittance will not be asked for until it is decided if publication is
possible, and this depends entirely upon the number of applications
received.

BLUE ROCK THRUSH AND MICE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.964085428571429" page_id="56237360"  page_num="90" year="" vol="">
I have a very tame and rather savage Blue Rock Thrush (Monticola
solitaria) which has been here some years and which has taken his part on
two occasions in rearing a family.
More than once during past seasons I have found dead mice on the floor
of the aviary he occupies, and it was only after finding him in the act of
battering a mouse, which he would not relinquish, that I began to suspect
him of doing his best to help me rid the aviaries of this scourge. Since then
I have seen him with a quarter-grown mouse which he finally swallowed whole
after giving it a good beating on the floor and perches. I am not aware that
he ever throws up any " pellets
It is odd that a bird with such predatory tastes should never, to my know-
ledge, have attempted to take the young of small birds such as Finches or
Roller Canaries which share his aviary.

BREEDING THE COLLARED JAY-THRUSH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98880137037037" page_id="56237360"  page_num="90" year="" vol="">
It may interest some of our members, and Dr. Hopkinson may add it
to his records, that the Collared Jay-Thrush (Garrulax picticollis) bred last
summer in an aviary of the small Zoological Garden of Shanghai. The pair
had inhabited the rather large aviary for about two years together with other
Babblers (White-throated, Spectacled, cinereiceps, and Berthemy's), Golden
Pheasants, and a Crowned Pigeon. Early last spring I noticed that the pair
was very keen on building a nest. However, the low evergreens with which
the aviary is planted were evidently not to the liking of the birds. I begged
the Chinese keeper to fasten a dead shrub high up in the corner of the aviary,
but nothing was done and the Babblers decided finally to make a nest out
of a small bunch of straw lying in a small wooden box with open front hanging
high up on the wall of the shelter. Here they made a very deep nest and laid
three rather large eggs of a beautiful blue colour. I could not ascertain
whether both parents incubated, but they were very anxious about their
nest and chased any bird away which dared to come near. After about
twelve days of incubation all the three eggs hatched. Unfortunately, the
other inhabitants of the aviary, especially a pair of Black-necked Grackles,
constantly inspected the nest and disturbed the parents so much that the
young died after three days. Had this pair had an aviary to themselves,
I am convinced they would have reared their children. The Collared Jav-
Thrush is, according to my experience, a very desirable aviary bird. He is
showy and for ever on the move, he is very hardy and does not molest other
inhabitants of the same aviary, even smaller ones like Peking Robins and
Java Sparrows. Male and female are easily distinguishable. The broad
band running from the ear-covers down to the breast is pure black in the
cock, while in the hen it is of a sooty colour.

SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF KINGFISHERS IN AUSTRIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977513636363636" page_id="56237361"  page_num="91" year="" vol="">
A most remarkable breeding record is that of the common Kingfisher,
with complete success, by the late Mr. P. Carniel in Austria. A full, most
interesting report is given by the late Mr. Carniel in the Gefiederte Welt. The
old pair were housed in a small aviary (the exact dimensions are not given)
with a small artificial basin and two artificial mud walls in which the pair
constructed their cave nest and after two failures reared a brood of six young
Kingfishers to full maturity. Mr. Carniel provided his birds with an unlimited
number of small fish. Most tragically and sadly Mr. Carniel was carried
away by a sudden fatal illness soon after this true lover of birds had achieved
this most remarkable success. If the common Kingfisher, which feeds
almost entirely on fish and is very aquatic, can be bred it should be easier
to induce the tropical Kingfishers, which need very little water and feed on
beetles, etc., from the dry ground, to go to nest in captivity.

WILLOW WARBLERS ATTRACTED BY AVIARIES
I wonder whether any of our members have noticed that aviaries appear
to have a particular attraction for Willow Wrens.
The several aviaries which I have owned in different districts have all been
haunted by these little birds. At present I keep only seed-eaters, so that food
supply can offer no attraction to Warblers, yet the Willow Wrens are
constantly on the aviary roof trying to find an entrance.
They appear to take a great interest in the inmates and I doubt whether
their intentions are benevolent. A Grass Finch, which escaped, returned
frequently to its home but was persistently chased away by the pair of Willow
Wrens on duty.
B. C. Thomasset.
We have noticed the same thing repeatedly and have even known them
to squeeze through |-in. mesh netting, so anxious were they to join the birds
inside the aviary.--E d.
A TALKING BUDGERIGAR
I have a Cobalt Budgerigar, hatched rather late last year, and which,
as an experiment, I brought into the house to see if we could teach him to
talk. Within six weeks he was saying " Joey ", and since then has learnt to
say "Pretty little Joey", "Come along", "Good-night, Joey", etc.
I took him out of the nest just as he was almost ready to leave and put
him in a cage in the kitchen. The maid took him in hand and I think a
woman's voice is the best for training them at first.
This bird is most amusing ; we let him out of his cage and he will at once
come on to my finger, run up my arm on to my shoulder, and nibble at my
ear, neck, and occasionally at my lips (when I speak to him); he does not
attempt to bite, however, he just tickles.
We put him on the table and give him a bunch of keys and a number of
paper spills to play with ; it is funny to see him talking away as he nibbles
at the keys. The paper spills he drags, one by one, to the edge of the table

and throws them over on to the floor, and then stands peeping down to see
where they have dropped. No matter how often you pick them up and put
them on the table Master Joey will throw them overboard again.
This bird will go anywhere about the house on my wife's shoulder, though
she has to be careful to take off her necklace and ear-rings, for Joey has more
than once broken a pearl necklace ; he is as quick as lightning and most
inquisitive about anything fresh.
He is a French-moult bird and though fully feathered drops his flights
and tail feathers ; this is probably why he is so very tame, for he can only
fly a very little, but as a pet I am inclined to think this is an advantage; to
see him running about playing on the table at times is exceedingly funny.
Anyhow, we are very fond of him and would not like to part with him.
As a pet and talking Budgie I think he must be hard to beat.
Last year I was successful in breeding 2 Red Rosellas, 5 Ringneeks,
5 Cockatiels, and considerably over 100 Budgerigars in all colours ; these
were all bred outdoors, in garden aviaries.
H. P. Sissons.
It is not only " French-moult " Budgerigars that become extremely
tame. We have known several perfect specimens that were quite as tame
as this.--E d.

CRIMSON FINCHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.943680791666667" page_id="56237362"  page_num="92" year="" vol="">
I note in the November issue of the Magazine that Mr. Andrew R. Hynd
asks if it is possible to sex young Crimson Finches, and as I breed them
regularly I thought perhaps I could help.
The youngsters on leaving the nest are dark brown in colour, lighter
underneath, with a little dull red on the lower back and above the tail. The
bill is black and in many respects they resemble young Zebra Finches. (They
have no red face as in the adult female, nor do they resemble her very closely
in any other respect.) At this stage the young are all very much alike, but
the males may be picked out by a little more red.
Within a month the plumage becomes darker all over, and by six weeks
time red is rapidly appearing on the breasts of the males.
I notice that Mr. Hynd is wondering if his youngsters are all of one sex.
I do not know how his will turn out, but such an occurrence is by no means
rare. Last season I had three-nests that were 100 per cent males.
While dealing with this beautiful little bird I wish to contradict some of
the statements made against it. I have kept it with a good many other
Grass Finches and found it harmless, though occasionally blustering in
demeanour. The only time it is likely to be at all savage is during the
breeding season and then the remedy is obvious. During the rest of the year
it is quite trustworthy with even Waxbills, providing of course they are not
overcrowded, but who is optimistic enough to expect harmony if this occurs,
whether a Crimson Finch is present or not ?

As there is always a demand from onr readers to hear about the
commoner kinds of birds and how they may be brought up, it has
occurred to me to put down a few notes regarding three chicks of the
above species, which were given to me in 1932, and two of which, now
full grown, are a never-ending source of interest and amusement to
us all.
About the middle of June a friend who owns a grouse moor in
Co. Antrim arrived at my house with a paper bag containing the three
downy chicks, two just about two days out of the egg and the third
about five days old. I was more than surprised to get these birds
from an inland moor many miles from the sea, but such is the case ;
this species breeds inland on this mountain. My experience of the
Lesser Black-backed Gull on the West Coast of Scotland was always
confined to small islands where I have found hundreds of nests.
Needless to say, I was delighted with the little chicks clad in their
light grey down with large black blotches all over ; this can be seen well
in the photographs taken when three weeks old. The job was to know
how to feed them. There doesn't seem to be much published about
Gulls, but we made an attempt by hand-feeding with bread and milk,
which they ate ravenously, and in a few days picked for themselves.
We kept them in a box with wire netting over the top ; as they are very
dirty things when young the hay had to be changed every day. These

W. H. Workman--Lesser Black-Backed Gulls
Gulls have a very curious habit--it is this : after eating a few mouthfuls,
even when very young, they would run across to their water bowl and
vigorously wash their bills, splashing the water all over the place.
They never lost this habit and now run over to one of the ponds, not
to drink but simply to wash their beaks.
After a few days we tried them with very small pieces of heart
mixed with the bread and milk ; this they went wild for and it was with
great difficulty that we got the younger ones their proper share. The
big fellow would get in first and if he had his way would leave no meat.
They seemed always hungry for meat, more so than for fish. Even
now fish does not interest them nearly as much as a bit of meat. What
puzzled me at this stage was how the old birds kept them in food, as
they had to fly miles to the sea for every meal.
After a few weeks it was easy work, two or three meals a day con-
sisting of bread, milk, potatoes, and any rough scraps of meat or fish
does them well; they now get the same food only twice a day. Strange
to say, they are very fond of that maize food which, readers will
remember, I described in an earlier number ; they eat it unsoaked
and rush for it every time it is offered to them.
I think I have shown from the above how easy it would be for
our members to bring up young Gulls and keep them as pets in their
gardens. Let us now look at them from the interest point of view.
They are great pets, always in the picture, always hungry, and always
in the best of form wet or dry. One has only to open the window
and call them for a bit of bread, when they come racing across the lawn
and catch the pieces in the air as well as any dog. They get very
annoyed with the Trumpeters who, of course, have premier place in
my affections and get the tit-bits, such as a dead mouse, etc., and
when so engaged the Gulls will sneak up and try to pull the Trumpeters'
feathers, but the Trumpeters are quite able to deal with them, and
with a roar chase the Gulls all over the place.
I did not pinion these birds when young ; they have one wing
clipped but I would advise members getting young birds to pinion
them at once, it saves a lot of trouble.
We kept them in a small aviary and one day my man and I thought
we would let them have a run on the lawn before their wings were

clipped, as we thought such young birds never having had the slightest
chance of flying would not think of such a thing without a little practice.
But the big one took a run or two across the lawn just like a plane
getting up speed and sailed most beautifully into the air round and
round till it reached a height of 50 or 60 feet, then it sailed down again,
making a perfect landing, when we caught it and clipped a wing and
treated the others the same. It was extraordinary to see how
easily the power of flight comes to these big birds by instinct--no
practising of balance, they just flew perfectly at the very first attempt.
The photographs, which I took at various times this summer and
autumn, show the gulls at different stages of their growth which,
during the first few weeks, is prodigious ; in fact one can see them
grow from day to day. We unfortunately lost one of these birds : it
fell when young and, I think, injured its brain ; it was never a good
doer like the other two.

PROLIFIC ZEBRA FINCHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9914705" page_id="56237373"  page_num="95" year="" vol="">
By The Rev. John E. G. Sweetnam
The difficulty mentioned by Miss Barclay in the February number
is one which most aviculturists would gladly experience, even with
such plebeians of the aviary as Zebra Finches. In reply to her query ;
whilst the only certain way of preventing breeding is the separation
of the sexes, excessive enthusiasm in this direction will be reduced by
removing all nesting materials. This procedure presents a practical
difficulty in the case of small hardbills, such as Zebras, which use
nesting boxes as bedrooms and are apt to suffer from the effects of
cold in bad weather if prevented from doing so. As the annual moult
will suspend breeding operations for a time the birds themselves are
not likely to suffer from over-breeding.
Having kept these vivacious but rather stupid little finches for
some years I have reached certain conclusions about them which may
possibly be of interest to members, and in any case I would like to
know if others agree with me.

The Rev. John E. G. Sweetnam--Prolific Zebra Finches
and, though I have generally found aviary-bred birds more satisfactory
than imported specimens--and a cross between the two best of all--it
seems to be more a matter of individual characteristics than of strain.
(2) All healthy pairs will nest and lay, the eggs being generally
fertile, but some pairs are much more liable to desert their eggs or,
more probably, their newly hatched young than others.
(3) None can be relied upon to resist the temptation to use nesting
material if it is available, piling it on top of partly incubated eggs
and thus rendering all attempts at incubation abortive. Apart from
the difficulty already mentioned, the removal of the temptation presents
a further difficulty where there are several pairs in an aviary all in
different stages of breeding activity. But for this besetting sin the
species would really live up to its reputation as one of the surest
breeding finches. Because of it I have always found them most un-
certain, some pairs, like Miss Barclay's, being prolific in the extreme
and others quite the reverse.
Personally, I have found these little rascals so trying to the temper
that I would have exorcised them altogether were it not that one is
so constantly asked to supply or exchange them. That the problem
is, unfortunately, not confined to bipeds of this species makes it no
less exasperating to find that the children upon which one's hopes
were set have inherited the original sin of the race, rather than the
</bodyText>

virtues of their parents !
(4) So far as breeding results are concerned, the method of feeding
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98744325" page_id="56237374"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
seems comparatively unimportant. Personally, I have had no better
results when spray millet was supplied than when the birds were fed
with ordinary millet and canary seed only.
(5) Though I have never been able to spare the space, I believe
the real secret of success--such as that achieved by The Keston Bird
Farm last season--is in allowing several pairs a large aviary to them-
selves, and I should be interested to know if those who have succeeded
in breeding considerable numbers of Zebras under these conditions
take any steps to prevent the deterioration of the stock through in-
breeding, or to remove odd cocks during the breeding season, both
of which would present practical difficulties in the larger aviaries.
These little finches are most prolific.

It has been suggested by a fellow member that I should give my
impressions on the keeping and care of these beautiful birds. I am
happy to do so knowing that every true Aviculturist will be interested
in the experiences of an amateur.
In the first place, I read an article in this magazine on these birds,
after which I decided to commence in a small way by purchasing a
pair of Golden ( Chrysolophus pictus) from Bogers of Liverpool. These
birds duly arrived in splendid condition and almost immediately
commenced to lay. In due course six eggs were laid, all of which proved
fertile and were hatched out. Two chicks died during the first week
owing, I believe, to the lateness of the season ; the remainder are in
my possession to-day, fine, strong, healthy birds.
Encouraged by this success I was most anxious to proceed further
and, fortunately, at this period there appeared an article in this
magazine by Paul Lambert, of Nawton, which proved most interesting
and instructive. He stated that anyone intending to take up this
hobby should not hesitate to communicate with him when he would
be happy to place his knowledge at their disposal. I took advantage
of this very generous offer with the result that we now correspond
regularly and, from the one pair of Golden Pheasants, some eleven
other species have been purchased, a list of which is herewith given :--

dwell upon this point, except to say that the majority are very
beautifully marked and are truly handsome birds.
As to the keeping and care of Pheasants, their needs are simple,
but it is essential to have a fair knowledge of their requirements,
and one cannot do better than purchase one of the many books
which are on the market. Personally, the book which I treasure more
than any other is one by Wm. Beebe entitled Pheasants, their Lives
and Homes , which can be obtained through the usual channels. Here
you have particulars of their habits, foods, housing, etc., all of which
are most helpful and valuable. In brief, my experience has been as
follows :--
Housing. --It is not necessary to give the majority large pens as
they do quite well in a limited amount of space, providing the correct
food is given. However, during the spring and summer not more
than one pair should occupy the same enclosure, and aviaries should
be well supplied with shrubs for protecting the hens during the
breeding season.
Food .--I was recommended to give the following: wheat, hemp,
dari, crushed maize, green food, flint grit (meal during winter months),
but in all instances in small quantities, in fact I found that these birds
eat less than ordinary poultry, and are, therefore, not expensive to
keep.
Water .--It is most essential that this should be fresh and should
be changed at least once daily: this point is most important if you
wish to keep your birds in a healthy condition, and it is advisable
to add a small quantity of sulphate of iron to the water, say twice
weekly.

Ailments. --Pheasants, I believe, are subject to one or two diseases,
but the only experience I have had is of " Scaly Leg An Edwards
developed this and became slightly lame. I was recommended to
purchase a small quantity of flowers of sulphur, mix to a paste with
paraffin oil and apply with a toothbrush to the affected part ; this
treatment was adopted twice in one week and the scaly leg was cured,
since when no further trouble has developed. Eeally, if everthing is
carried out in a proper manner there is no cause for alarm as these
birds are most healthy and clean in their habits.
Breeding .--\0x25A0 Apart from the incident mentioned at the commence-
ment of this article I cannot pen any other experience, but I am
looking forward keenly to the coming season and hope for success.
Anyone taking up a hobby who has a little time at his disposal
cannot do better than adopt this most fascinating pastime ; it is not
expensive unless you purchase some of the rarest species, and it affords
unbounded pleasure.
It is surprising how tame the birds become after a short period in
captivity.
Lastly, may I, through these columns, thank Mr. Lambert for his
kind help and interest. He has been most helpful in offering advice
concerning the purchasing and has shown great interest in the welfare
of my birds, and also Mr. Seth-Smith for allowing me to write this
article for so valuable a magazine.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988046541666667" page_id="56237384"  page_num="106" year="" vol="">
In 1931 I persuaded a friend to rear some Great Bustards by hand, of
which the Zoo had one pair. In 1932 we tried the experiment, successfully,
of rearing them under hens. I enclose two photographs.
They are fed as little fellows on insects, chopped fruit (they like tomato
best), and bread-crumbs, and as they advance in age they get tomato, bread,
green food, grapes, and rabbit liver, or an occasional mouse chopped and
mixed up, but they like large pieces. They are simple enough to cater for
as the diet can be less expensive, fruit being replaced by green peas (soaked
hard ones will do), but, as you know, they are a funny mixture of being over-
tame yet very nervous of any strange effect such as bright colours that they
are not accustomed to, or a dog passing that they don't know, or a sound
that is new to them. Their bones are so light and brittle that leg or wing
accidents are liable when frightened. Their feathers, too, are soft and one
wonders at their once being indigenous to as far north as, I believe, the
Lothians. Sometimes a bird takes a dislike to another one and is apt to
bully it; but most birds are like that.

HATCHING BLUE BIRDS BY FOSTER PARENTS
I have, owing to my absence from home, only just seen the suggestion
put forward by our member, Mr. A. Lewis, in our Magazine for November,
1932, respecting my failure in rearing Blue Birds under foster parents.
Presumably Mr. Lewis failed to observe the article written to the fancy
press some short time ago by Dr. M. Amsler who has had considerable
experience in the rearing of Blue Birds under foster parents.

cases. In the first, I took my five Blue Robins eggs to a nest I knew, and,
to my chagrin found the foster parents' eggs just hatching, in fact one chick
had left the egg. I removed this youngster and the three remaining eggs
and substituted my own five much larger blue eggs. I did not expect much
result, but to my surprise the Robins sat on for another six or seven days
and hatched out the substituted eggs and finally reared three young.
" On another occasion I was at a loss for a Robins nest, and heard of one
in which the clutch was just complete. In this case my own Blue Birds had
been setting ten days. I took the risk and swapped the eggs, and the red-
breasts must have had the surprise of their lives to hatch out four chicks
at the end of two or three days incubation. In this case all the eggs hatched
and the young were reared satisfactorily."

THE KEA AND THE IMPORTED MYNAH
I was recently discussing the habits of the Kea with an early settler in
New Zealand, a man who is now over 80. In his early days he lived in parts
of the South Island where the Kea was very common and his explanation
of the " changed habits " may be of interest to you.
In the mountainous districts various species of the plant Raonlia,
commonly known as the vegetable sheep, are common. They are described
on pp. 105-106 of Dr. Cockayne's book, New Zealand Plants and their Story,
2nd edition, an illustration facing page 104. The author says : " The vegetable
sheep are not inaptly named, for at a distance a shepherd might be misled."
My informant told me he had frequently seen the Kea perched on one of these
masses of vegetation driving its beak into the interior in search of the many
grubs found there.
The change of habit from this to a dead or even a living animal is easy
to understand and seems to me more logical than the theory usually advanced.
The skins at an abattoir are usually hung on fences to dry in the sun and
wind, the wool being underneath, and therefore the sheepskin in this position
would bear no resemblance to the vegetable counterpart.
It is obvious that the bird searching for grubs in a dead or living sheep
would readily persevere and thus acquire a taste for the fat layer which it
would soon reach with its powerful beak.
At the same time it should be recognized that all the birds do not acquire
this taste, which is probably somewhat similar to the objectionable habit
seen in the man-eating tiger or shark. An individual bird having acquired
the habit becomes a very great danger to the farmer but it is rather sweeping
to suggest that the habits of the whole species have changed.
It is particularly interesting to note the changing habits of imported birds
and also of native birds due to the importation of other forms of food.
I have been observing of late the Mynah from India. In my district,
the Wairarapa, it seems to be entirely insectivorous, but further north--
Hawkes Lay--I have seem them taking nectar from the flowers of the flax
plant or the red-hot poker. This habit it seems to have learnt from the
native Tui or Parson Bird. In my garden I have watched the Tui feeding

in this way but up to the present have never seen the Mynah doing this.
This strikes me as interesting because the distance between the two places is
only 150 miles.
Again it may be accounted for because Mynahs are scarce here but more
plentiful in the warmer northern district, and it is possible that the changed
habit may be peculiar to an occasional member of the species rather than to
all in a district.
I trust that these sketchy notes are not boring, but knowing that extreme
accuracy on these matters will interest you I am with all humility putting
forward my suggestions and observations.

Masterton, N.Z.
The above letter, received by the Editor, was not intended for the
Avicultural Magazine, but as it is of much interest to our members we
feel sure Mr. Peacock will not object to its publication. The Kea is a most
intelligent and inquisitive bird and we do not think it would mistake a sheep
for a plant. On the other hand, having acquired the habit of eating mutton
fat through the carelessness of the early sheep farmers, and possibly some of
the present-day ones, in exposing skins and offal, it was quick to learn that
this could be obtained by killing the living animals. But, as Mr. Peacock
says, all Keas do not acquire this taste, in fact, probably very few do. We
met a sheep farmer the other day who lived in a district in which there were
a number of Keas and he had never had the least trouble from them, although
he had lost plenty of Jambs from the attacks of the imported fox and the
native Raven. The reward of the Government of a substantial bonus for every
Kea killed is most reprehensible and may result in the extermination of one
of the most interesting members of the New Zealand avifauna. ---Ed.

THE GREEN BROAD BILL

<bodyText confidence="0.9933525" page_id="56237388"  page_num="108" year="" vol="">
I have just lost my hen Green Broadbill after nearly four years in captivity,
which is, I suppose, the rather modest record for this species. I am inclined
to think that Broadbills are not fit subjects for aviculture in a temperate
climate except for people who can turn them loose in hot greenhouses among
tropical vegetation. Here their gentle disposition and non-destructive
habits should make them very suitable subjects, while their surroundings
would provide them with those opportunities of bathing in damp leaves
which are essential if the beauty of their plumage is to be retained. Few
individuals master the art of performing their ablutions successfully in a dish.

WHITE-CAPPED PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996952058823529" page_id="56237389"  page_num="109" year="" vol="">
I have just received a pair of White-capped Parrots (Pionus senilis), a pretty
species very rarely imported. The plumage is most attractive and very varied.
The head and neck, apart from the snow-white cap and a faint whitish streak
across the throat, is slate-coloured with tinges of blue and green; the breast
blue and slate-coloured with tinges of green. The upper surface is green or
bronze green with a considerable amount of pale brown, prettily shaded,
in the centre of the wing. The flight feathers are deep brilliant blue mixed
with green and the tail quills are of the same colour, some being edged with
rose-red. The under tail coverts are pink, eyes large and dark, and
surrounded by an area of bare, parchment-coloured skin. Bill, horn-coloured ;
size about that of the Dusky Parrot.
My birds are evidently a pair from the marked difference in the size and
shape of the head and beak, but I am not quite sure which is the cock and
which the hen.
After a few days rest, warmth, and good feeding one of the pair--I rather
think the lady--has developed a most irascible temper and ruffling her feathers
makes determined efforts to bite a human visitor. Should her mate get
in the way at such times he is liable to receive a nip as well, but normally
they seem on friendly terms. The only sound I have heard them utter so far
is a very gentle murmuring.
Tavistock.
SNAKES, MICE, THRUSHES AND FISH
The account in the Avxcultural Magazine of Blue Rock Thrush and
mice impels me to write of another cure for this pest that might be useful
to the Society and to the Zoological Gardens. At Belle Vue, being troubled
in a hot aviary by mice, I tested out snakes for fur and feathers. I found
that the Egyptian Sand Snake (Eryx johnii) would not touch feathers. I placed
one in my aviary and lost him for a year when he reappeared very fat: not
a bird had disappeared in unknown ways, but the mice had all gone.
Another curious thing about Thrushes and Blackbirds is their love for
small fish. We had a very shallow fountain in our aviary in which we put
sticklebacks. The Thrushes and Blackbirds took them as soon as our backs
were turned : of course after noticing this habit we cut off the spines.

LORD BUCKMASTER'S BILL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995118" page_id="56237389"  page_num="109" year="" vol="">
I entirely agree with your criticism of Lord Buckmaster's Bill
in that it would be grossly unfair to prevent the poor man from keeping
British birds while larger foreign species may be kept by wealthier people
in their parks. I think, however, we should not shut our eyes to the very
large amount of bad aviculture that exists and needs reforming. Not only
are dealers' shops and dealers' methods of trapping and transporting birds
often in great need of improvement, but the great majority of cages made
and used are far too small and are very badly constructed. There are also
a large number of bird owners who need to be taught that bird cages should
not be hung in the blazing sun, in draughty windows, nor in kitchens ; also

that birds require baths, green food, and grit as well as seed and water ; that
cleanliness is essential; that perches need washing as regularly as cage
floors, and that a thick spar of wood fixed at both ends is very tiring to
a bird's legs and feet.
Tavistock.
I imagine that this Bill has little chance of becoming law in its present
form, and undoubtedly it requires to be watched and amended. But I think
aviculturists will have to reconcile themselves to the passing, sooner or later,
of legislation of some such character, for there is an increasing number of
people to whom the caging of wild birds is abhorent.
Of course, the subject bristles with difficulties. To start with, a definite
principle to work on is most desirable, and the only sound one is, I think,
" Never to seek one's pleasure or one's gain
In sorrow of the meanest thing that breathes."
But when one comes to apply this principle troubles begin, for one has to
consider in each case whether the benefit to man is sufficient to compensate
for the injury inflicted on the lower creature, and this is often a difficult
problem.
It is a fact that British birds, with the exception of the Redpoll and Siskin,
seem to resent captivity more than most foreign species. Newly caged Gold-
finches and Linnets certainly suffer, and I believe that few of your readers
would defend the caging of Skylarks. On the other hand, there can generally
be no cruelty in keeping any bird hand-reared from the nest, though Swallows
and other species obviously unsuited for captivity might well be prohibited
even if hand-reared.
I do not think that we need trouble ourselves greatly to defend the right
of the working man to keep a British songster in a small cage. So long as he
has Canaries, Budgerigars, and Bengalese, not to mention other foreign
species easily bred in cages or small aviaries, I do not see that he will be hardly
used by a ban on the caging of wild-caught Linnets and Goldfinches. Bull-
finches are much sooner reconciled to captivity ; and this species is such an
enemy to the fruit-grower that almost anything which will reduce its numbers
is defensible.
Horatio R. Fillmer.
The Bill, as drafted, is altogether too drastic, but few would object to
certain amendments to the present law as regards the capture and caging of
British birds. Personally, I would like to see the use of large clap-nets
forbidden, for with these the professional bird-catcher captures Finches
and such like by the hundred and sells them at a ridiculously low price to
persons who have no idea as to how to look after them properly. There are
certain birds that should never be kept in captivity under any circumstances,
such as Swallows, Swifts, Martins, Kingfishers, and I personally would add
Skylarks and Dippers. Many or most of the other insectivorous birds thrive
well in captivity if taken in hand by experienced persons, and few who are
not experienced ever attempt to keep them. One has heard lately a great deal
about the alleged blinding of birds to make them sing, but I personally
have never come across a case of this abominable cruelty, and until recently
I should have said that it was certainly never practised in this country;
but now I am beginning to wonder whether, in some of the low haunts of our

slums, where Chaffinch singing competitions still take place, some villains may
not still exist who practise this abomination. In our Magazine for August,
1915, Dr. Bernard Potter wrote a very interesting account of the birds
observed by him in Flanders, and he describes his disgust at finding that the
natives of a certain village were in the habit of holding singing competitions
for Chaffinches with blinded birds. The Editor, in a footnote, says that this
practice, although prohibited by law, also exists in Italy. One can hardly
imagine any Englishman, even of the lowest grade, doing anything so vile, but
if it is even done here the law is surely powerful enough to mete out the punish-
ment that should finally put a stop to it.
These Chaffinches, I learn, are kept in the most wretched little cages in
which they can barely turn round, and here, too, is a case for an amendment
of the present law.
D. Seth-Smith.
I think that all members of the Avicultural Society should follow the
advice of our Editor and protest in the strongest possible way against the
Bill that has been introduced by Lord Buckmaster. If the Bill as drafted
becomes law I can see in the near future a further attack on our hobby. This,
to me, appears only the thin edge of the wedge ; sooner or later another
attack will be made on the keeping of foreign birds. The sponsors of
this Bill know next to nothing about the keeping of cage and aviary birds,
and if a check is not put upon them will do our hobby a great deal of harm.
Therefore I would suggest that every one of our members, from the officers
downwards, should write to their respective M.P. protesting against this Bill.
The 1926 Bird Protection Act already in existence is sufficient to deal with
any form of cruelty, and there is no need for further restrictions. With every
one of our members pulling their weight, this Bill will meet the fate it justly
deserves, but we must act now and at once.

AVICULTURE, VOL. I
I notice that a revised edition of Vol. I of Aviculture is under
consideration. Perhaps you would not resent my bringing to notice a few
errors which probably occurred through printer's faults and in translation.
They are as follows : Under " American Warblers ", p. 276, the description
of Mniolilta varia (Black and White Creeping Warbler) is given : " all lined
with white and dark-brown ". It should be black in place of " dark-brown
Siurus auricapillus (Oven bird) has the crown orange-tawny not " bright red ."
Icieria virens (the Yellow-breasted Chat), largest of all the American
Warblers, has the lower parts rich yellow not " vellowish-fawn ". It also
states that Oporornis formosus (Kentucky Warbler) resembles it. The
resemblance is superficial and the bird is only half the size.
I question the size of Compsocoma sumptuosus, p. 116, given as 10|- inches.
Also on p. 326, under " Broadbills ", sixth line, " ruby-grey " must be
the printer's error.
I am hoping that you will accept these corrections in the spirit they are
given. I know only too well the mistakes that can happen before an article
\0x25A0appears in print. Our own Aviculture is full of them, but we hope to improve.

Dr. HOPKINSON'S " RECORDS "
In the current Avicultural Magazine (February, 1933), I notice
an error occurring in Dr. Hopkinson's " More Additions to Breeding Records
He states that some parrotlet Hybrids were bred in California and identified
by me as Forpus v. vividus X F. coelestis . This is wrong ; from the descrip-
tion given by Mrs. Tomlinson I suspected that the male was not coelestis ,
so asked her to kindly send me the mounted specimen she had of a bird that
had died earlier. She complied and it was identified as Forpus conspicillatus ,
So her Hybrids were of Forpus conspicillatus (male) X F. v. vividus (female).
I don't understand how this mis-statement occurred in Dr. Hopkinson's list,
but hope you will correct it in the Magazine.

During 1932 I bred four youngsters of Bathilda ruficauda, five
Sporaeginthus clarlcei, and seven Estrilda astrild. I had two youngsters of
Neisa dufresnei but, unfortunately, the cock died and the hen left the
youngsters. Otherwise, it would have been a first breeding record. In 1931
I reared, by using Bengalese as fosters, two young of Pytelia melba, which
died at six or seven months old in nearly full adult plumage. I was interested
to learn that they were at this age in adult plumage, as, in my opinion, it
takes rather a long time for Pytelia phoenicoptera to become adult.
Perhaps some of my notes should be of interest to Dr. Hopkinson.

BOURKE'S PARRAKEET
(Neopsephotus bourket)
By E. J. Boosey
When I was asked by our Editor to write an article on Bourke's
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.988184842105263" page_id="56237399"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Parrakeets, I wondered for some time how best I could convey the
unique beauty of this little bird to those who, perhaps, may never
have seen a living specimen.
Bourke's Parrakeet is the complete antithesis of the now-happily-
defunct " Bright Young People 55 . They seem to realize instinctively
that their beauty is of such a quality that they have no need to
advertise themselves. No need to be for ever shouting to anyone who
will listen : " Look at us--look well--and see how beautiful, how vivid
we are--before it is too late ! "
If you don't appreciate the beauty of Bourke's, you just don't and
that's an end of it, but they would, I feel sure, pity rather than blame
you for such lack of taste. For Bourke's are quiet little birds, and in
their tranquil loveliness they remind one of lavender and old lace,
and the half-forgotten peace of a golden age that is never likely to
return.
Their voices are not harsh, but quiet and pleasant, and entirely
in harmony with their appearance.
Unlike most Parrakeets they possess no vivid colours. Their plumage
is of a delicate smoky brownish grey laced with pale gold on the back.

E. J. Boosey -- Bourke's Parrakeet
The shoulders are of a mauvish lavender blue, and the lower breast
is enlivened with a small pink sunset which is in harmony with the
pale evening blue which appears on the under wing-coverts, under tail-
coverts, thighs, and sides of the rump.
Bourke's Parrakeet inhabits the interior of New South Wales and
the surrounding district of South Australia adjoining, also the interior
of West Australia. Their staple diet should consist of a mixture of
canary and white millet with oats and a very small proportion of hemp
seed. Millet spray is also much appreciated, but they are not great
green food eaters. They are not so very difficult to breed ; that is to
say, they lack the tiresome habit of some Browns and most Hooded,
of coming into breeding condition in the autumn--an impossible time
of year, when it is too late to allow them to nest.
Bourke's, indeed, vere in the opposite direction, and usually show
signs of wanting to breed rather sooner than one would wish. The cock
becomes more than normally active and begins to feed his wife towards
the end of February, but one has to harden one's heart, for if the eggs
were successfully laid without the hen succumbing to egg-binding it is
highly probable that the young brood would be killed by frosts in April.
The end of the third week in March, therefore, is the earliest they
should be given their nest-boxes. The average hen Bourke's is a very
fussy little bird about her nest, and if the box itself or the position in
which it is hung is not exactly to her liking her method of showing her
disapproval is very different to that of other hen Parrakeets--
particularly Broadtails. A hen Broadtail who considers the box
provided for her unworthy of the family her fond owner hopes she will
rear in it always follows the same programme : the box is put in and
this is usually the sign for a lot of excited tail-wagging on the part of
the cock (fathers being notoriously bad judges of the suitability or
otherwise of a nursery for their offspring), while the hen--more
cautious--is eventually persuaded gingerly to enter the dark aperture,
after the cock has made tolerably certain that no snakes or other
dangerous vermin lurk within. As soon as she had disappeared there
follows further tail-wagging and much anxious peering down the hole
on the part of the cock. If his wife likes the box provided, she will be
observed to spend longer and longer periods inside it, biting about and

generally preparing it as a nursery for her family. If, on the other hand,
she does not, she at first registers her disapproval by paying frequent
but cursory visits in order, apparently, to make quite sure that it is
entirely unsuitable. Then, having made quite sure, she will indulge in
a premature moult, rather than make use of such a travesty of a suitable
nesting site.
Bourke's, however, behave quite differently. As soon as the
nest-box is hung in the shelter, both rush outside and pretend to be
completely terrified of it, though the cock considers himself justified in
indulging in a slight courting display, which often consists of jumping
on to the wire netting and making short rapid runs up it, duiing which
the wings are depressed to show the lavender blue of the shoulders.
His wife then inspects the nest and her inspection is brief, but
extremely thorough.
If it suits her you may expect eggs within a week or so. If it does
not she will show you as much in no uncertain manner. It will be
carefully examined, found wanting, and thereafter completely ignored,
and the only thing to do if you desire a brood of young Bourke's is to
provide her at once with another nest-box of an entirely new type, and
preferably hung in a quite different position to the first one.
Generally speaking, Bourke's are particularly partial to a natural
log, or, failing that, a box completely covered with bark. They seem
to like inspecting the entrance hole while clinging on to the bark as
a Woodpecker might, and an ordinary plain wood box does not, there-
fore, appeal to them.
Once the hen has decided that she approves the nest provided for
her, she will disappear inside it and will hardly be seen again until the
young brood is a week or ten days old.
This may cause her owner a certain amount of anxiety, particularly
as the majority of hen Parrakeets do not begin to sit until the third egg
has been laid, but on no account should one interfere. If the hen is
dead on the nest from egg-binding there is nothing further to be done
about it, and if not one's over-anxious interference may cause her to
desert, so it is far best to leave well alone and hope for the best.
When the young brood is hatched no particular extra food is
necessary except possibly a little of their ordinary seed mixture (to

which extra oats and a very small quantity of hemp have been added)
being thrown daily on top of a flat mound of earth in the open run,
where any that is not eaten at once will probably be consumed later
on when it has started to sprout.
The object of throwing seed on the ground when there are young
in the nest is to induce the parents to eat rather more than they
otherwise would, because for some extraordinary reason, nearly all
Parrakeets will rush eagerly down to devour a handful of seed thrown
on the ground as though it were some rarely-provided and delicious
tit-bit, although a pot of precisely the same seed mixture is perpetually
before them on the seed tray. The behaviour of young Bourke's when
they first leave the nest is extremely variable. Some are stupidly wild,
others excessively tame--so much so that they will step on to your
finger and allow you to carry them into the shelter--where, for safety,
they should always be confined each night for at least the first ten days
after they are fledged.
As, however, the majority of nestlings are at first desperately
wild it is a wise precaution to line their aviary entirely with taut
string netting about six inches from the wire, or else to cover the
furthest end (where they are most likely to injure themselves) with
a protective hedge of twiggy branches to break the impact if they
dash against it. This should be done in good time before the young
ones fledge.
Nothing is more nerve-racking than to have to watch a young
bird battering itself wildly against the hard wire netting when one
knows that to enter the aviary with the idea of helping would only
be to make matters worse. It is a curious fact with regard to two of
the breeding pairs of Bourke's here at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm
that the tamest and steadiest pair produce the wildest young ones, and
vice versa.
Bourke's are not particularly fond of green food, but even so,
when they have young to feed this does not apparently prevent them
from eating any rank and laxative weeds that may be growing in
their aviary, which is most disastrous to the young brood, who
frequently develop nestling diarrhoea as a result.
It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that the outside flight

should be cleared of all but a patch of flowering Poa annua grass
before the first brood of young ones hatch.
It is rather interesting that Bourke's bred in aviaries in this country
seem, usually, more partial to healthy and luscious green food such as
spinach beet, possibly because they were born in a more " green and
fertile land " than the parts of Australia their parents inhabited.
Their ability, or otherwise, to stand extreme cold does not seem
to have been thoroughly tested, doubtless because their rarity does
not encourage people to experiment with them.
We have, however, left them out in an aviary with a well-built
though unheated shelter during some quite severe early frosts in
autumn, without their being any the worse, but we have never
as yet tried them out-of-doors for a whole winter without any
artificial heat.
It is probable they would survive a moderately mild winter, but
would succumb to any very prolonged period of extreme cold and fog
combined.
Some cocks are rather inclined to chase their hens about a good
deal if they consider that they are not settling down to domestic
duties as quickly and readily as they should. No particular alarm,
however, need be felt as they lack the murderous tendencies of many
of the larger Parrakeets, and the chasing about to which their wives
are subjected is often beneficial in that it induces backward hens to go
to nest earlier than they otherwise would.
Bourke's, of which we have several pairs sitting at the present
time, were successfully reared here at The Keston Foreign Bird Farm
both last season and in 1931.

Rev. J. R. Lowe--Early Notes
have been indications in the Avicultural Magazine that notes from
members on the quite commonly kept birds would be welcome.
As this March weather became more beautiful each day I decided
to take my pair of Shamas from the indoor bird-room and put them
in their outside aviary, a roofed affair with two wooden sides at
right-angles and two wire sides at right-angles, 9 ft. square by
7 ft. high. I turned the cock out on 14th March and, although there
were several ground frosts, he was none the worse after ten days.
On 24th March I brought the hen down and rather stupidly turned her
out as well. The cock started clicking ferociously and began to sing--
one can only describe it as under his breath--and the hen burst into
loud song (this particular hen has almost as fine a voice as the cock).
Matters began to look serious and, in a few moments, a hectic aerial
chase began ; the hen dashed into the bottom of a bush and the cock,
singing furiously all the time, began to attack the lady unmercifully.
It was no go, and I put the cock in a large cage hung up in the aviary
with the hen at liberty. The position at the moment, 3rd April, is
merely an armed truce ; and the hen infuriates her proposed husband
by sitting on his cage while he rattles the wires with his beak. Yesterday,
2nd April, I let the cock out, and he was as good as gold for about five
minutes ; the hen during that time sang lustily, sometimes the full
Shama burst of music and then short mellow notes, the cock only
clicked and flicked his tail. Then suddenly he went for her good and
proper, and the lady dived into a Cyprus bush, quite safely. I left them
for half an hour ; coming back, the cock had gone back into his cage,
the lady was still embedded in the Cyprus. I did not feel convinced,
and slipped the cage door down. I must be patient, I suppose, till
mid-May.
My first pair of Diamond Doves are most intriguing. They are
1932 birds of English breed, and came to me last September. Now,
3rd April, the little hen is making an absurdly flimsy nest in the aviary
shelter, which contains hybridizing pairs of Finches. To those who
have bred hundreds of Diamond Doves what follows will seem hardly
worth recording, but they are new birds to me and everything they do&amp;gt;
is a thrill. Up to the end of February I was not certain that they were
_a pair and then, one day, I saw the cock display, and his absurd bow

and tail cocked up in a fan and tiny coo rewarded the long wait from
September. My pair, I notice, both coo to themselves ; the hen has
a funny little treble voice, but she is using it quite a lot just now ;
the cock's coo in displaying is different from the coo he uses when he is
sitting still. At times he gives a great leap towards the hen and almost
knocks her over ; I am looking forward to my first Diamond Dove egg.
I never quite know these days whether it is polite to mention
Budgerigars in the Avicultural Magazine. However, it seems that
it is going to be a very fertile year ; for from three pairs that began to
lay on 1st March seventeen eggs were laid and sixteen hatched ; fourteen
are alive and doing well on 3rd April. I have two hens this year who
refused to lay in any nest-box hung up in the shelter of their respective
compartments ; directly I put up a box in each outer flight both hens
laid forthwith and are now sitting hard.
A cock Linnet, who has been in a large aviary with a hen Bullfinch,
has learnt that absurd song of hers perfectly. He also calls her with
a Bullfinch pipe, and he delights my heart by feeding her at every
possible moment.

With regard to the Splendid Parrakeet (Neophema splendida),
I think I may claim to know more than any man living, having made
a special study of it in its wild state. The district I live in is situated
about 180 miles west of Port Augusta and just south of the Gawler
Ranges in South Australia, and possibly this is the only district in
Australia where these extremely rare and beautiful Parrakeets are to
be found, in isolated pairs. In 1931 my hired man was coming in
from the paddock where he had been working when he observed a Hawk
chasing a small bird. The birds were flying toward him and the small
bird flew right into his waiting hands just as the Hawk struck. It tore
some of the feathers from the Parrakeet's neck but did not injure the
skin, so he brought it home. Although this sounds rather far-fetched
it is perfectly true, and as I had lived here for fourteen years and had

H. B. Scholz--The Splendid Parrakeet in Australia
never seen a bird like this I put it in a small aviary with a pair of
Canaries, with which it agreed quite well.
Some months later I happened to read in the Press about the very
rare Scarlet-chested Parrot being found again, after having been
thought extinct. I compared the bird (hen) I had with the description
and found it was Neophema splendida without a doubt. I let Mr. Simon
Harvey, a leading aviculturist of South Australia, know, and he made
a special trip of 400 miles by car to see it and ascertain if there were
any more here. I went out with him for a week, but we did not see any.
Last year I was determined to find them if there were any about,
so I went out from August to December and combed the district through,
and was successful in securing twelve. I particularly made a study
of their natural habits, sometimes lying for hours camouflaged with
mallee boughs to watch them feed. They only occur in isolated pairs,
never in flocks, and feed on the seeds of various native grasses and
small herbaceous plants. It was interesting to watch them eating
spear-grass seeds. They would wait until the wind would blow a stalk
towards them and then hold it down with one claw whilst they ate
the seeds. It has always been a problem as to how they obtained their
drink, as they do not come into the settled areas. I live right on the
fringe of the great heart of Australia, and north of me there is,
practically speaking, no civilization, and very little water is to be
found. I observed that they ran their beaks along the round leaves
of a small shrub and, on examining the leaves, I found by squeezing
they exuded about two drops of palatable juice. This, I presume,
is the secret of their water supply. I found four nests, usually about
8 feet from the ground. One contained three cock birds, another three
hen birds, another one hen bird, and the other a pair. I also caught
two hens and a cock bird (adult birds). I caught them on the nests
whilst feeding their young. I had no trouble in feeding the young,
using granose biscuit, scalded and sweetened with a little honey.
They build in a perpendicular hollow with a few dry leaves about
18 inches from the entrance. These birds live in the most God-forsaken
country it is possible to set eyes on, preferring sandhills and spinifex
country to the bigger timbered mallee country. One who is
inexperienced would never think of looking for birds where these are

found. I let Mr. Harvey have two pairs and a Mr. Hunt one pair,
and I have retained three pairs for breeding purposes. I have chosen
the most brilliant birds to breed from. I have one young cock who
shows red from the throat to the vent. Some males have the clear-cut
blue head and red chest, whilst others have the straggly red patch.
I saw one gorgeous cock bird, perched not 20 feet from me, whose
breast was perfect. The old cock bird I have has a clean-cut blue head,
wonderfully silky in appearance, and has the red chest extending
nearly to between the legs. He is a picture to behold. The females
I have are not of a duller green than the males, but they lack the
brilliant blue on the head and, of course, the red chest.
It will be interesting to see how my young birds get on as the two
young cocks are much brighter than the others I had.
Budgerigars, Many-Colours, and Port Lincoln Ringnecks, Cockatiels,
Major Mitchell Cockatoos, and Galahs were here by the hundreds
this year. I saw a hock of some thousands of Budgerigars last week.
They are usually gone by this time. They all come here to breed.
I am keenly interested in the preservation of our rare birds and am
now on the look-out for the Night Parrot.

BEECHE'S JAY

Beeche's Jay is a very beautiful bird with its plumage of dark

blue and glossy black and small crest. It is known in New Mexico
and the southern States of U.S.A. as the Blue Jay.
It is chiefly found in New Mexico and Arizona ; a resident through-
out the oak belt which generally fringe the foothills of the mountains
and ranges well up among the pines.
I met with great numbers when staying on the Buno Mountains
Ranch in New Mexico. I have watched them, when hidden behind
a tree, very quickly and quietly swoop down into the open door of
one of the fowls' runs, pick up a grain of maize, and quickly fly out
again and up into the tree to eat it ; but when discovered their notes
are very harsh and far-reaching.

James B. Housden -- Beeche's Jay
I was told that in the fall of the year large flocks of this Jay visit
the ranch, in fact so as to become quite a nuisance, fighting for food
with the pigs and fowls ; and it would be no difficulty to catch fifty
of them with the open door and a long string in the fowls' runs.
They are very restless, constantly on the move prying into this
or that, spending a good portion of their time on the ground twitching
their tails almost constantly.
I found a number of nests of this Jay built in low shrubs about
10 feet from the ground ; nests like deep saucers ; eggs, four to seven
in number, a beautiful spotted green colour.
I have one of these Jays, a most lovely bird and very tame.
I have mentioned in a former number the day I was lost in the
forest in New Mexico. After I had met with an old coloured man
and rested in his cabin, he pointed out the way he thought would take
me to the ranch.
I had walked a very long way when a strange coincidence occurred ;
somewhere from the scrub half a dozen of these Jays flew in front of
me squawking and flapping their wings (something like some of the
birds at home will do in a country lane). I followed on and these
birds continued to fly in front of me. I thought perhaps they might
be flying to the ranch, and this actually proved to be the case, for
after another long walk I came to the wire fence of the ranch.
My base of operation during the month I spent here was the ranch
house, which stood at a most beautiful sub-tropical spot. Sitting
under the trees at a very delightful spot it was quite enjoyable to
watch and listen to the wild life all around. This was quite a paradise
for birds, the study of which day after day was very delightful. It is
an inexhaustible subject and one that one never tires of in this wonderful
country.
My room at the ranch overlooked a small lake ; one could watch
the sun go down behind the hills, mountains, and valley that fringe
the lake in a mingled glory of red and gold. In a few minutes it was
gone below the horizon and darkness came quickly. Hardly had the
sun gone down than the stars began to peep, one after another, and
very soon night birds began to utter cries. A memorable night the
writer would not have missed.

By Alfred Ezra, O.B.E.
Although a good many birds nested during the fine summer of
1932, very few young were reared, and only two that had not done so
previously. These were the White-winged Mynah ( Sturnia
nemoricola) and Fytch's Bamboo Partridge ( Bamhusicola fytchii).
I now give the particulars of all the nesting and rearing of birds during
the year.
Elegant Parrakeet (Neophema elegans). A pair of these birds
laid their first egg on the 4th April. In all three eggs were laid. Two
were infertile and the third had a partly formed chick. Nesting again,
the hen laid four eggs about the third week of June. By the 17th July
four young were hatched. Two of these died, but the other two were
successfully reared, leaving the nest on the 19th August in splendid
condition.
Bourke's Parrakeet (N eopsephotus bourkei). A pair laid two eggs
in June but did not sit. The eggs were transferred to an Elegant's
nest. One young was hatched on 15th July. Chick found dead on
the 17th, most probably because the Elegants were incubating four of
their own eggs, and these did not hatch out till the 17th. The male
Bourke's was found dead on the 29th July. Cause, congestion of
lungs. A new male bird was put in with the hen on 8th August.
Another nest, and three eggs were laid the first week of September.
One young hatched out on the 24th, but the other eggs were infertile.
Young one found dead on the 10th October. Parents had been feeding
well. A female Elegant paired to a male Bourke went to nest and
laid three eggs. All infertile.
Ring-necked Parrakeet ( Psittacula krameri). A lutino hen
mated to a green male bird nested early in February, laying three
eggs. One was broken during incubation, one was infertile, and one
young was hatched out on 3rd March. Found dead on the 29th.
Nested again about the end of April, laying three eggs. Two young
were hatched out on 25th May. The third egg had been cracked.

Young fully reared, leaving the nest on 14th July. Both young
birds green.
Another pair of the above, but both cock and hen lutinos, laid four
eggs early in March. All eggs were fertile, but all the young died in
the shell. Laid three eggs again early in May. All eggs again fertile,
but all young dead in shell. It looks uncommonly as if some weakness
in the two lutinos prevents the eggs from hatching.
A third pair of Ringnecked Parrakeets, a green cock and a
lutino hen, nested, laying three eggs about the third week of March.
One young hatched out on 18th April, but the other two eggs were
broken. One young reared, leaving the nest on the 24th June.
Young one green.
Fourth pair--green cock and lutino hen, nested, laying six eggs
by the 23rd March. Three young ones were hatched about 21st April,
the remaining eggs were infertile. One young was found dead on
22nd April, but the other two were reared. Both green.
Alexandrine Parrakeet ( Psittacula nijpalensis). Green cock
bird and lutino female. Laid two eggs from the perch on the 23rd
December (1931). Another two eggs were laid on the 27th December
(1931) in the nest. One young hatched out and reared, leaving the
nest on the 27th March, 1932. Green again.
Layards Parrakeet ( Psittacula calthrapce ). Laid three eggs by
the 25th May. All infertile.
Malabar Parrakeet (P. jperisteroides). Four eggs laid by the
30th April, all infertile. Hen pulled her flight feathers out.
Barrabands Parrakeet ( Polytelis swainsoni ). Laid one egg on
floor and two more were found on the grass. This was done because
they did not like the outside nest-box. As soon as I gave them a
nest-box inside the aviary shelter they laid four eggs. Three young
hatched in June, only one reared.
Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet ( Polytelis alexandrce). The old
pair laid four eggs by the 15th April. All were hatched by 5th May.
One young one found dead in the nest, and the other three dead in
the grass. Laid three more eggs. Two young hatched out by 8th June.
One young found dead in nest, apparently having been killed, the
other young one was seen being carried about by the female in her

beak--dead. I thought after this extraordinary behaviour a change
would do them good, so I removed them into another aviary. Three
eggs were laid by 21st June. One young hatched but the other two
eggs were infertile. This young one was also killed by the 11th July.
She again laid four eggs by the third week of July, and this time I
removed the cock bird from the aviary and left the hen sitting. Two
young ones were hatched, and these were successfully reared by the
hen alone. I wonder whether this plan will work again or some new
treatment will be necessary.
A pair of young birds I reared last year nested, laying two eggs
by the 24th May. Hen bird was found dead on the nest through being
egg-bound. I transferred the two eggs into the Barrabands' nest.
One egg hatched out on the 12th June, but the young did not
live long.
Another pair, also reared last year, laid four eggs. All the eggs
were infertile. Another two eggs were laid by the middle of June,
both of which were again infertile. It is interesting to note that
these Parrakeets nest when they are not quite a year old.
Crowned Starling ( Galeopsar salvadorii). Last year's breeding
pair laid two eggs by 11th May. Both hatched out. One young one
died and the other one was reared. Laid again, three eggs by 27th July.
Two young were hatched. One died but the other one was reared,
leaving the nest by the end of September. I again let the hen bird
out, and she was at liberty the whole time till the young were reared.
The cock bird was kept in a cage inside the aviary shelter where the
nest was.
Wonga Wong A Pigeon ( Leucosarcia picata). These birds have
been most unsatisfactory. In November, 1931, they laid one egg on
the floor of the aviary, which was broken.
Another egg was found broken in a nest on 11th December, 1931.
Laid another egg on the 17th February, 1932, which was infertile.
Another two eggs were laid by the 27th March, both of which hatched
out by the 17th April. Both young ones found dead on 5th May.
Again laid one egg between 18th and 25th May, both of which were
infertile. Another two eggs by 22nd June. One young one was
hatched 7th July, the other dead in shell. The young one was found

dead on 12th September, fully grown and feathered, but had not left
the nest. By 16th September two more eggs were laid. These eggs
were placed under domestic Pigeons. One hatched out and the second
one died in the shell. The young one only lived a couple of days.
On 26th November they laid two more eggs, which hatched out, but
both the young died soon after hatching. These birds nested in a
large basket about 10 feet from the ground inside the aviary shelter.
A good deal of straw, grass, and twigs were used in making the nest.
Ruppell's Starling ( Lamprotornis purpureopterus). I had no
success with these birds. The hen became egg-bound after laying
one egg, and then the cock died a few days later.
Silky Starling ( Spodiopsar sericeus). Laid four eggs in June
but the hen would not incubate them.
Rothschild's Grackle (. Leucopsar rothschildi) . Early in May
five eggs were laid, all of which were eaten up by the 6th. Laid four
eggs again by the 23rd May, and this time I confined the cock bird
in a cage in the aviary, but the hen would not incubate the eggs. By
the 22nd June five more eggs were laid. The cock bird was again
removed, but the hen would not sit. On bringing the cock bird back
all the eggs were eaten up. By 20th July four more eggs were laid,
and the cock bird was again removed. This time the hen sat well
but all the eggs were infertile.
Slenderbill Starling ( Cinnamopterus tenuirostris). Three eggs
were laid about the third week of May. One young was hatched out
on 16th June, and the other two eggs were thrown out of the nest
with young partly out of the shells. The young one died on the
28th June. By the 15th July two more eggs were laid and these were
both broken. Again by the 26th July four eggs were laid. These were
all fertile, but the young were only partly formed. By the
7th September three more eggs were laid. All were hatched by the
25th. One young one died on the 7th October, another on the 9th,
and the third one--which I thought was going to be reared--died on
the 18th October by accidentally falling out of the nest. These birds
nested in a basket placed inside the aviary shelter about 10 feet from
the ground. The nest was made of dried grass and feathers, and a
considerable quantity of mud in the bottom of the nest about 6 inches

thick. Bather the shape of a pear with the top scooped out. It took
the birds three weeks to build it.
White-crested Jay Thrush ( Garrulax diardi). These birds
never attempted to make a nest, but laid several eggs on the aviary
floor between April and May. I had a nest made for them on the
23rd May, and they readily occupied it, and laid two eggs in it by the
24th June. Two young were hatched on the 10th July. Both were
found dead the next day. They had been thrown out of the nest.
No further attempts were made to use the nest, although several
more eggs were laid on the floor.
Pasquier's Jay Thrush ( Garrulax pasquieri). No success with
these birds as I lost the hen through being egg-bound.
American Bluebird ( Sialia sialis). Three eggs were laid by
the 16th April, and all these disappeared. Most probably were eaten.
Another four eggs were laid in May. Three of these eggs were broken,
and the fourth was hatched out. Young left the nest on 6th June
not at all strong, and was found dead the following day. Another
four eggs were laid by the middle of June. Hen would not sit.
Shama ( Kittocincla malabarica). The hen bird killed the male and
was removed from the aviary. A fresh pair were put in. These were
English bred. One egg was laid on 28th May, but the hen died of
egg-binding. Another hen was put in with the same cock bird. She
laid only one egg on 14th June, which disappeared by the end of the
month. Two more eggs were laid in July. Both fertile but young
only partly formed.
White-winced Mynah ( Sturnia nemoricolor). One young success-
fully reared as reported in the December number of the Magazine.
Crowned Lapwings ( Stephanibix coronatus). Two eggs laid in
a hollow in the ground by the pond on 15th and 16th April. One
young hatched out on 14th May and was found dead the next day.
The second young one was hatched out on 16th May and this one was
found dead on the following day. This one had evidently been killed,
as both legs were broken.
Madagascar Partridge ( Margaroperdix madagascariensis) . Two
pairs were left together in a large aviary. Unfortunately one male was
killed just as they were coming into breeding condition. One hen

nested under some pampas grass and the first egg was laid on 29th May.
Ten eggs in all were laid. As the hen would not sit the eggs were put
under a Silky hen on 21st June. Seven young were hatched. On
23rd June another hen was found incubating eight eggs under some
ivy. She gave up incubating these eggs and these were also put under
a Silky hen on the 29th. Four young hatched out by 16th July.
One of these was drowned. Ten young were fully reared.
Swinhoes Pheasant-tailed Pigeon (Macropygia swinhoei). Two
pairs of these birds have laid numerous eggs, but only two young
were reared. Most of the eggs were accidentally broken.
Renauld's Ground Cuckoo ( Carpococcyx renauldi). One nest
was made inside the aviary shelter in a basket about 10 feet from the
ground. The nest was made of twigs, grass, leaves, and feathers.
Three eggs were laid by 7th May, two of which were fertile. Chicks
partly formed. Hen did not incubate very well. By 9th June three
more eggs were laid, all of which were infertile. Four more eggs were
laid by 9th July. Two of these eggs were fertile but chicks only partly
formed. I hope to turn these birds out in my big animal enclosure
this summer, and hope for success.
Fytche's Bamboo Partridge ( Bambusicola fytchii). Nine young
were hatched, but only two of these were successfully reared. Already
reported in the December number of the Magazine, 1932.
African Wattled Plover (Lobivanellus lateralis). Nest made on
gravelled pathway in one of the large aviaries with only a few stones
heaped up. Laid four eggs in April, two of which were broken and
the other two were infertile. A second nest was made on the turf
in the small flight of the aviary, again using a few stones and some mud.
Four eggs were laid. Two young were hatched out but died almost at
once. One egg was broken and the fourth egg contained a dead chick.
Sulphury Seed-eater ( Serinus sulphuratus). Built a nest,
resembling that of a Chaffinch, in some ivy in May. Four eggs were
laid. Two young were reared.
Purple-headed Starling ( Lamprocolius auratus). One pair
built a nest in a big oblong nest-box in the flight of the aviary. Four
eggs laid by the 8th June. Three young hatched by 25th June. Parents
fed well for twelve days, but on examining the nest on 8th July all

the young were found dead. Nested again in a bamboo nest-box, but
no signs of eggs or young ones were seen. Another pair went to nest
and laid three eggs in July. One young hatched and this was thrown
out of the nest by 6th August.
Chinese Blackbird (Turdus mandarinus). Built first nest on
window ledge of the aviary, and laid three eggs in it by 11th April.
All these disappeared in a few days. Again laid four eggs in the same
nest by 23rd April. These also disappeared. Built another nest in
some ivy and laid six eggs. All infertile. Another nest was built
in a box above the aviary door, and five eggs were laid in it. Only
one young one hatched out, on 20th June. This was well fed for nine
days and then it disappeared. Another five eggs were laid, all of which
were infertile. There are too many birds in this aviary, including
Chinese Magpies and Lidth's Jays, so one does not expect anything
to be reared in it.
Superb Starling (Spreo superbus). Five of these birds in one
large aviary built several nests and seemed to enter every nest in
turn. Eggs were found in all the nests. On 31st May two young
ones were seen flying about in the aviary. These were fed by all the
five Starlings and fully reared. Several more were hatched but no
more reared. Another pair laid sixteen eggs in another aviary in
twos and threes, but only two lots were incubated and five young were
hatched out. None of these were reared as the parents gave up
feeding them.
Japanese Magpie (Cyanopica cyanea). A nest was found in some
ivy. containing three eggs in September. Three young hatched out
on the 16th September. All three died as the parents instead of
feeding them took to feeding a pair of Occipital Blue Pies in the next
aviary.
Tambourine Dove (Tympanistria tympanistria). One pair hatched
out several young but in every case they either fell out of the nest or
were pushed out when about fourteen days old. Another pair also
hatched out several young, but only two were successfully reared.
White-cheeked Bulbul (Pycnonotus leucotis). A nest was built
with dried grass and feathers in a log nest-box. Four eggs were laid--\0x25A0
all addled. Three more were laid by 27th June. This nest was

destroyed and all eggs broken. Two more eggs were laid and destroyed
by 15th August.
South African Bunting (Fringillaria tahapisi ). Built a small
nest in a shrub, very like that of a Linnet. Two eggs were laid. Both
infertile. By 27th August two more eggs were laid. Both of these
disappeared five days later. Another two eggs laid were found broken
on the grass.
Bronze-winged Pigeon (Phaps chalcoptera). The old pair
which reared ten young last year laid sixteen eggs between April and
July. Not until August were two young reared. Another pair bred
by me last year successfully reared three young ones.
Pekin Robin (Leiothrix lutea). I liberated about forty of these
birds in May. Some nested in the garden and reared young. All
except half a dozen have disappeared.
In the large animal enclosure I was successful in rearing the following
birds :--
White Peafowl. Eleven.
Mandarin Duck. Reared twenty-six. These were reared by
full-winged Ducks in nest-boxes put up for them in trees about 15 feet
off the ground. The Ducks with the Ducklings were seen walking
round the fence to get to the water. As soon as the gate was opened
they all went in and were reared by their parents. These fly about
a good deal and so far have not gone away.
Maned Geese. Five of these were reared.
Other Ducks. About twenty--Carolinas, Meller's, and Bahamas.
Swans. These did not nest.

Add to end of record : When in Australia in 1930 I found that
they were considered fairly easy breeders there in suitable
surroundings. Smith, at Brisbane, has great success in
an aviary made by enclosing about a hundred square yards
of bush He had 37 young birds reared that season when
I saw his place, and had done about as well in other years,
but when I was there again in 1932 he was having bad luck,
for he had only reared two chicks, mainly owing to rats and
snakes. When the mound is made the hens are shut up in
pens adjoining the main run, as otherwise they hunt the
young about till they kill them; the cock turns over the
mound almost daily, and always loosens the earth over the
eggs due to hatch, so that Mr. Smith says that he must
remember the date of laying of each egg.

This lengthy list reaches its end here, but it is really an endless
job, for new records are naturally being made and I am still asking
for more in this line, that is new records, particularly printed ones,
and corrections needed for the old. Notes to the Magazine would be
the most useful.--E. H.

Probably " the usual sunflower seed mixture " referred to by Mrs. Hewley
is the cause of her Parrakeet plucking itself, as all packet Parrot foods are
unsuitable for feeding Parrots and Parrakeets. The bird should be fed on
canary, white millet, wheat, oats, and peanuts, with fruit and green food,
but no cake or tea. A twiggy branch of any non-poisonous deciduous tree--\0x25A0
oak, ash, elm, lime, hazel, etc.--should be provided for the bird to nibble, ash
being particularly good. If it could be given some form of aviary accommo-
dation the chances of a permanent recovery are considerably increased.
Bathing facilities should be provided.

I thought that perhaps you might be interested to hear about an
extraordinary pair of Bourke's Parrakeets in the aviaries of Mr. Rowland
Hutchinson, of Auckland, whose kind hospitality I am now enjoying. This
pair of birds was purchased last year, and a few months after being received
from Australia they went to nest. The hen laid eleven eggs. Of course, these
were too many to cover, so only eight hatched out; of these, six were reared.
Before the young had left the nest the hen laid again ; this time she hatched
and reared seven perfect young ones. Again before the last youngster left
the nest she again laid six more eggs and was sitting on them when I left
for Fiji.
Surely such a hen is a veritable treasure, beating even a Budgerigar in
fertility. Mr. Hutchinson has promised me some of this prolific strain to
bring back with me.

richest deep red colour. There is no doubt that the hot, moist atmosphere
suits them ; the house is thoroughly sprayed with tepid water twice a day,
which keeps it damp and moist.
G. H. Gurney.
[M. Delacour was the first to start a Tropical house, which is really a stove-
house, with tropical vegetation in a very moist atmosphere, which is kept at
a temperature of between 70* and 80* F. The Tropical House in the
Zoological Gardens has proved a great success, though the vegetation has
suffered somewhat from the presence of a large species of cockroach, a relic
of the time when the house was given up to tortoises. The health of the birds
is superb, and their plumage keeps perfect. For tropical insectivorous birds--
Honey-eaters, Sugar-birds, Pittas, and such-like--the conditions of a Tropical
house are ideal.-- Ed.]

SUNBIRDS

<bodyText confidence="0.999781676470588" page_id="56237425"  page_num="139" year="" vol="">
It has been my pleasure at one time or another to have in my collection
several Sunbirds, as they are always great favourites of mine. All are
exceedingly handsome creatures, and if kept under proper conditions are
long-lived and a source of joy to their owners. I give pride of place to the
Malachite, the largest of the family. It is a beautiful emerald green, with
a tuft of yellow on each side of the breast which, however, is only seen when
the bird is resting. The central tail feathers are prolonged and much longer
than the rest. Pen and brush alike fail to do justice to the extreme beauty
and coloration of this wonderful species and therefore no word of mine can
convey the contour of this glorious gem of the avian world ; it must be seen
for its beauty to be appreciated. When seen in the sunlight the feathers
glisten with radiant hues, now golden, now bronze, and now shining green.
Another bird I have kept with success is the Purple Sunbird, all glittering
purple of different shades as you view it from different angles. I have found
this species a very good songster. Closely related is the White-breasted
Sunbird, which has a purple back but is white on the breast. Then I have
also had the Double-collared Sunbird, a glorious creature, silky bronze in
colour with two golden bands around its neck.
I have always found Sunbirds do best if kept in a large flight cage, but
no doubt they would do well if allowed to fly loose in an indoor aviary or
tropical house ; but I am sure they are not suited for outside aviaries as the
sudden changes in our climate are too much for them. A large flight cage,
tastefully decorated with small natural twigs, and flowers when possible,
and, given the right food, they will live long and happily and be a source
of joy to their owner. Various methods of feeding have been adopted, but
I have found the following the best: To a cup of boiling water add one
teaspoonful of Horlick's Malted Milk and the same quantity of sugar. Twice
a week a little honey may be added. I am sure many Sunbirds have a short
fife because the syrup is made too strong. Sweet grapes and a small piece
of banana are all helpful, as well as small flies, but if they show the least sign
of over-fatness stop the fruit supply. I have found that Sunbirds can stand
the cold when once acclimatized, but do much better with a little heat. Great
care must also be taken to see that their feet are clean, as they will loose
their claws if great care is not taken. Sunbirds are also great bathers and

should be allowed to have access to fresh water daily. One of the greatest
drawbacks with these birds is that no two birds of the same species must
be kept together, as they are sure to fight, and the weaker one is apt to get
killed.
A. Martin.
I have a very fine Sunbird ( Chalcomitra gutturalis), which, all the time
I have had it, has never shown any inclination to bathe. Nevertheless, I have
sprayed it daily, which it seems to enjoy. A few days ago I filled its dish with
rain water, which happened to be handy. Shortly afterwards I noticed the
bird go down to drink (which most Sunbirds are rarely seen to do) and, having
had a sip, proceed to give himself a really satisfactory bath. Since then
I have used rain water, and the bird scarcely misses a day without drenching
himself. At first I was greatly surprised to see him bathing as he had never
shown the slightest interest in water, but then I realized that perhaps it might
be more than a mere coincidence that the provision of rain water and his first
bath should have taken place on the same day. When we remember that wild
birds are very fond of bathing in wet foliage, I think we need hardly be
amazed that the softness of rain water should seem attractive to them.
I doubt not that this habit will give an extra gloss to the bird's already
gem-like plumage.
From observations on the Sunbirds which I have possessed--certainly over
a dozen species--I have been forced to the conclusion that the majority of
species care not greatly for any insects larger than the minute forms that fill
the air on a warm evening. Further, I am convinced that they never extract
live food from flowers by means of their tongues as is often stated in textbooks.
It is curious that, whereas the small Cinnyris michrorhynchus and Cyrtostomus
asiaticus are fond of fairly large flies and spiders, the larger Chalcomitra
gutturalis , Cinnyris habessinicus and Nectarinia famosa, etc., find great
difficulty in swallowing anything larger than a gnat and, when they do
succeed in getting it down, generally throw it up again. A good way of
providing insect food for these larger Sunbirds is by putting the cage out of
doors in warm weather near a bush or wall, which attracts those minute forms
of life which dance in clouds. It is curiously fascinating to watch the birds
snapping at these in the air.

MR. LEWIS OF HARRODS
Aviculturists wifi be interested to learn that Mr. Lewis, who has for so
many years managed the Zoological Department at Harrods, has now set
up on his own at 179 Brompton Road. Here will be found birds of all sorts,
dogs of many breeds, and the smaller pet mammals, also general requisites,
cages, etc.
Mr. Lewis is an aviculturist of no small merit, having kept many of the
rarer foreign birds, such as Sunbirds, Sugar-birds, Tanagers, and the like,
and he won the medal for successfully breeding the Orange-flanked Parrakeet
for the first time in captivity.
Mr. Lewis hopes to specialize more in the rarer species of birds rather than
the commoner kinds, and he will be pleased to advise any member on general
livestock. I am sure we all wish Mr. Lewis success in his new venture.

This beautiful Finch occurs in the coastal districts of the south-
eastern portion of Australia, in Tasmania, Kangaroo Island, and
the larger islands of Bass Strait. Its principal habitat is Tasmania,
whence most of those that have been imported to Europe have come.
They are partial to the scrub and herbage which grows near water-
courses, and are found in small parties, generally accompanied by the
so-called Sydney Waxbill--the Red-browed Finch (Mgintlna temporalis).
They have a peculiar plaintive note, and when they fly the brilliant
scarlet colour of the rump is particularly noticeable. The nest, according
to Campbell, is " bottle-shaped, or covered in, with spouted entrance ;
constructed of grasses chiefly, with the addition of portions of other
plants ; lined inside somewhat sparingly with fine grasses and fur
or feathers. Usually situated in thick-foliaged tree or bush." One
pair of these finches was exhibited at the last Crystal Palace show, but
few have been imported in recent years. They are delicate at first,
and said to be difficult to import. In 1908 I brought a number home,
and we had no trouble with them, but others with far more experience
have sometimes had very bad luck. There seems to be no record of
this species having bred in Europe, but Dr. Hopkinson found an
aviculturist in Sydney breeding them quite freely, as recorded in
More Additions to Breeding Records. Mr. Neville Cayley, in his

P. W . Teague--Gouldians
admirable Australian Finches , gives a long and interesting account of
the Fire-tail. He considers it to a great extent insectivorous, but
Mr. H. E. Peir, who he quotes has bred numbers in aviaries while
feeding them upon canary-seed and an abundance of green-food and
grasses in seed only. His advice is to keep Fire-tails by themselves,
not with other birds of any kind, and to give them dense cover in
which to hide. Apparently several pairs may be kept in the same
aviary providing they have no other companions.
Mr. Cayley gives other instances of successful breeding in Australia,
and quotes the Curator of Beaumaris Zoological Gardens (Tasmania)
to the effect that Fire-tails have been bred in captivity in Tasmania
" for the last sixty years at least, but who was the first person to do
so is now impossible to find out. They require a cage not less than
four feet by three, and will build their own nests among branches
placed therein, one pair to a cage and fed on plain canary-seed (hemp
is fatal)."
The great secret of keeping Fire-tail Finches seems to be to give
them abundant dense cover in which to hide.

By P. W. Teague
First of all I would take this opportunity, with the Editor's
permission, of expressing my thanks to the great number of enthusiasts
who have written me most appreciative letters about my previous
article on Gouldians. I had so many letters that I doubt if I answered
them all; however, it is most gratifying to me to know my article has
been the means of helping so many who had previously failed with
these delightful birds.
Last season was somewhat disappointing from a breeding point
of view with Gouldians, due chiefly to my being from home for nearly
six weeks in June and July. During this period I had to leave my birds
to the tender care of a village girl who, I think, did everything I asked

her not to do. The amazing part is that Gouldians could have lived
under such treatment as I found on my return. Fortunately I took the
precaution to add " Yadil " to all the automatic drinkers otherwise
my losses might have been heavy. Even a strong, hardy tri-coloured
Parrot Finch died from the slap-dash " treatment of this village lass:
however, it proved to me that English-bred Gouldians can stand a lot
and it also proved that I had evidently got stamina into them anyhow.
My absence I shall blame for my poor breeding results, although it
should be understood that not every pair of Gouldians will breed.
I mated six pairs which were in good trim when I left in June, but the
only ones to be successful were the two pairs of second generation birds
which reared two from one pair and five from the other. The five left
the nest in October, but the sharp early frosts we had then killed
two in one night, so I brought the remainder indoors with their father
who completed the rearing. These young ones were in the " between
time ", the stupid period, that is, partly feeding themselves and partly
being fed by the male. The hens at this time are often on the look-out
to commence another nest, leaving the cock bird to finish off feeding
the young. These stupid young birds haven't sufficient sense to have
a good " fill up " to carry them through the long autumn nights, and
they would not feed with a lantern in the aviary. Here let me give
a warning not to remove the young from the parent birds until you
are quite sure they are all feeding themselves. This lack of a good
" fill up " before going to roost also caused the death of four young
Cordons the same night through this same severe frost: although they
appeared to be feeding themselves, they paid the penalty for their
independence--the stupid period again. For safety I also brought
the other two young Gouldians indoors which were hatched earlier
in the season.
I found the second generation Gouldians much more ready to nest
than first generation birds and proved most excellent feeders. My second
generation birds stood the winter splendidly in their unheated out-
door aviary, without artificial light, and despite the snow blizzard
and severe weather we had. These aviaries, as previously mentioned,
are shuttered up with " Sunralite " or " Windolite " shutters, but
this did not prevent the water being frozen to a solid block of ice

P. W. Teague--Gouldians
every night. It should be noted the birds were dry, free from all
draughts and cold winds, which 1 think important. To give readers
an idea of the exposed position these aviaries occupy I had two blown
over. These two aviaries are screwed together and measure 13 by 3 ft.,
so the force of the gale to move this lot can be guessed.
Another point of note is that the three late hatched young were fed
almost entirely on the soaked seed method given in my article, with
the addition of Virol in their drinking water daily. Fresh seeding
grasses and green food were unobtainable here, for the severe frosts
killed everything except cabbages, and these the Gouldians would not
touch. These young Gouldians have made remarkable progress, good
size and now--early May--almost completed their moult to adult
plumage. On the other hand I have two hens over twenty months old
which have scarcely changed a feather to adult plumage, and this in
spite of the fact that they both laid when about twelve months old,
but, like Dr. Sprawson's experience, the adult males would not take the
slightest notice of them. This goes to show how individual Gouldians
differ both in the matter of moulting and also in their individual
tastes.
My stud of Gouldians, numbering over twenty, contains birds from
six months old to an old pair I purchased six years ago. This pair
were in full adult plumage when I got them, so they are probably
much older. I have one adult cock, bred by mating father to daughter,
and another from brother and sister. These are about two years old,
of quite average size, and appear to have as much vigour as birds bred
from unrelated parents.
I noticed in Mr. Highman's letter in the February issue that his
Gouldians relish white ants. A Gouldian breeder I know in Natal informs
me that his birds won't look at the white ants, neither have I been
able to get my Gouldians to touch our meadow ants pupa although
offered quite fresh regularly during the summer. No doubt the Virol
water I recommend helps to fulfil this loss. That reminds me I have
been in communication with Virol, Ltd., about a difficulty I experience
when using Virol-water in hot weather. I wrote to the Managing Director,
who has been quite interested in my experiments with Virol for
Gouldians, and I am indebted to him and their chemist, Mr. Wood,

for carrying out some experiments for me. Herewith Mr. Wood's reply,
which I feel sure will be very helpful to our friends in hot climates.
" With regard to the souring of the Virol and water mixtures
you are in the habit of using for your birds. You will appreciate that
the difficulty lies in finding a preservative which shall be not only
easy to use, but also completely harmless to the birds. I have, however,
worked out : a method which I think will serve your purpose
" Obtain from your chemist some 10-volume Hydrogen Peroxide.
Add the Virol to water which has been warmed to about blood heat ;
to half-pint of this solution add one teaspoonful of the Peroxide.
Mix thoroughly, allow to cool before giving same to the birds.
" You can take it that this addition will be without any harmful
action whatever, and a solution so treated will keep even under summer
conditions for about three days. I cannot tell exactly how long it will
keep, as I have been forced by weather conditions to conduct my
experiments in artificial heat. Should you find it necessary, there is
no objection whatever to doubling the quantity of Hydrogen Peroxide
used. I should like to point out while on this question, that on dis-
solving Virol in the water, the fat contained in the Virol is bound to
separate and form a layer on the surface. This must not be taken to
mean that the solution is in any way 4 going off It is a perfectly
natural result and one which cannot be avoided in any way."
I shall try the above formula this summer, but my method of making
the ; Virol-water is to boil the water first and then let it cool to blood
heat before adding the Virol. I shall be interested to hear what results
and observations are made by those using the above.
In spite of my absence I did not lose a single Gouldian from the
usual summer complaints, but the bitter cold winds we had in November
and December last caused the death of two Gouldians from chills.
My Fire Finches, Cordon Bleus, Blue-headed and Golden-breasted
Waxbills all came through the winter outdoors without heat, and I take
it last winter was of average severity; anyway, it was pretty severe
in this locality.
I forgot to mention that the old pair of Gouldians previously
\0x25A0mentioned usually commence moulting in November or December
in spite of their being imported birds. This pair usually commence to

nest in April or May, and they are a wonderful pair having hatched and
reared 28 youngsters altogether. I only wish all my other pairs had
been as prolific. It is this old cock that has been such a wonderful
foster-parent too, having reared two or three young ones that had been
prematurely deserted.
In conclusion there is a very true saying I should like to repeat :
" Diligent observation is more useful than written theories." So
diligently watch your birds and endeavour to find out what they want.

By Dr. E. Hopkinson, C.M.G., D.S.O.
Sunbirds are now being almost commonly kept as cage-birds, not
only in big collections but by people who want a single pet bird which
is easy to cater for and to keep in perfect health and happiness. For
this reason and for their beauty Sunbirds provide exactly what is
wanted, and this has suggested that some indication of their status
as cage-birds may be helpful to those interested.
This essay in this direction takes the form of a list of those species
of which the writer has records of their having been kept, documented
by references to coloured plates and notes of avicultural interest.
No descriptions of plumage nor accounts of the wild life are included,
for as regards the first, written descriptions to most of us mean but
little, while a plate is the next best thing to a series of skins as an aid
to the identification of a new bird ; as regards the habits, etc., of the
birds, they must be searched for in the works of the authorities, and
the references given will, it is hoped, be a help towards this.
The plates referenced are mostly from Shelley's Monograph of
the N ectariniidce which appeared in 1876-1880 (abbreviated here
as " Shelley, Mon."), and from Jardine's " Sunbirds," Naturalist's
Library , Edinburgh, 1843, the plates in which, though old-fashioned,
are quite good of their kind (Nat. Libr., xvi).

The British Museum Catalogue, vol. ix, pp. 1-126 (1884), provides
descriptions of all the species known at that date, Shelley's Birds of
Africa, vol. ii, pp. 10-166 (1900), deals fully with the African species
and contains coloured plates of about ten, while for those of India
there is the third volume (1926) of Stuart Baker's Fauna of British
India : Birds, pp. 372-418, with one coloured plate {Mthopyga gouldice).
Of course, the number of Sunbirds which have been kept in captivity
form but a minute proportion of the family, which includes about
150 species divided into three or four times as many sub-species, and
out of the 20 or more genera it will be seen that only 9 are represented
to date in Aviculture.
The references given under each entry in the list which follows are
mostly avicultural, and give the sources of my records. The chief are :--
Neunzig's Fremdlandische Stuben-vogel, Madgeburg, 1921,
pp. 105-111 (here as Nzig.) ; Delacour's article in Aviculture, 1925,
pp. 251-6, with a coloured plate showing six species (Avic ., i) ; the
Zoo List of Birds, 1929 (G. C. Low), reference to which is indicated
by a Z and the list-number. The pages of our Magazine and of Bird
Notes (here as A.M. and B.N.) also provide their share of the references,
though only the more important ones are included. Perhaps I may
refer to a particular omission, that is A.M., 1918, p. 153, where the
same subject is dealt with, commencing with the days of pre-Mellin
ignorance, when Sunbirds could practically not be kept, so that the
appearance of one on the show bench was hailed as " unique ", up to
the year 1911, when the Mellin's food regime was introduced by
Mr. Ezra and Sunbird-keeping converted from a hopeless business to
the simple one it is nowadays with Mellin or Horlick as the food-basis.
In that article the question was asked who actually first used
Mellin's food for these birds and where ? We know who introduced
it to England and when, but had it been discovered by another
previously ? As far as I know no definite answer was obtained in
1918 ; perhaps we may get one now.
Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa (Linn)). Z. 616. Hab. : South
Africa. Plates : Shelley, Mon., pi. 5 ; Bird Notes, 1916, pi. 74.
First imported about 1914. Count Segur was apparently the first
to own the species, " he had two pairs in 1914 " {Nzig., p. 106),

proved to him how easy a Sunbird is to cater for nowadays, and
what a happy cage-bird one makes ; incidentally too, this new
possession may be one of the causes of this article.

1929, Goodfellow brought two or three for Mr. Spedan Lewis,

By the Hon. Anthony Chaplin
Having been invited by the Editor to make some remarks about
the birds I have kept, I should like to begin by saying that although
I seldom have more than half a dozen individuals at the same time,
and very often less when I have something of special interest or rarity,
yet at one time and another I have owned a large and varied number
of species, many of which have eventually been presented to the
Zoological Society. My speciality has been, and always will be,
Sunbirds, a family which now contains almost as many species as the
Humming-birds, and which, therefore, has one more point in common
with that most interesting of all bird types. For although the experts
may shout when the Nectariniidse and Trochilidae are mentioned in
the same breath, yet these two very distinct families have more than
enough in common to confuse (and at the same time excuse) the
superficial ornithologist. Both have a very rapid and dragon-fly-like
flight; both suck the honey from flowers and snap insects in the air ;
both bear a resemblance to one another in form and colour. Isolated
species of Humming-birds live on isolated Andean peaks, and in the
same way the volcanoes of the Central African lakes often have their
unique species of Sunbird, which are likewise found just below the
snows, an example of this being Lord Dartmouth's Sunbird on
Buwenzori. And this recalls an important point which should not be
overlooked when keeping Sunbirds in captivity, namely, that some
species actually enjoy a cool misty atmosphere and are the better
for it. Aviculturists are too apt to overdo heat, at any rate as regards
the Nectariniidse, and perhaps I may be permitted (I hope without
giving offence) to point this out to Mr. Martin who, in the last issue
of the Magazine advocates heat for Sunbirds. He is certainly right in
respect to some species, as for example the little Cinnyris leucogaster
of South Africa, which he has kept, and which from collectors' accounts
seems to be a particularly delicate species. On the other hand Nectarinia
famosa is capable of standing great cold and severe stormy weather,
as indeed it must at home in the wild and inclement Drakensberg.

The Hon . Anthony Chaplin--Sunbirds and Others
Of the two dozen species of Nectariniidse that I have possessed,
I think the Shining Sunbird ( C . habessinicus) has proved the hardiest.
This is interesting because the species inhabits the torrid Red Sea
littoral, and is represented by a subspecies on the Arabian side.
I let this bird out on a warm, sunny morning in February ; it was
alarmed by a Pigeon flying over low, and darted off into a wood.
I subsequently heard it calling in an orchard over a quarter of a mile
distant. This product of the tropics was away all the afternoon without
food, and the thermometer must have fallen to round freezing point.
When my wife and I had given up all hope of ever seeing our little
friend again, he suddenly appeared and hovered about the lattice
window of the drawing-room, whence he had originally set out. I may
add that he was none the worse for his adventure, but I am afraid
I have since lost him, as I tried the experiment again and this time
he may have got lost for he has not been seen since.
The tiny Cinnyrus bifasciatus microrhynchus from the Zambezi
Valley is also quite indifferent to cold. I had one in Scotland in the
late autumn and early winter of 1929, which I was obliged to keep
in a room facing north and east. The little bird used to sing happily
with the thermometer at 40* F. But if Sunbirds are to be acclimatized
in this way it stands to reason that their food must be made as
nourishing as possible, so that once again I am compelled to disagree
with Mr. Martin. Moreover, I have never seen any signs of over fatness
in Sunbirds : they seem, on the contrary, to use up all their heat in
constant activity, so that no superfluous energy is left over for fat
production. Again, I have never found a Sunbird to suffer from foot
trouble of any kind (except perhaps the rather harmless, if unsightly,
thickening of the scales on the tarsi, produced by age), and as far as
I can see there is no reason on earth why a Sunbird should ever lose
a claw, unless it is kept in such a way that its perches become encrusted
with its droppings.
Three perches of different girth are ideal: one half-way up the
cage at each end to allow room for the bird to hover above them,
and the third near the ground in the middle, with the food and water
within reach at each end on the ground. With this arrangement the
perches never get dirty ; nor, may I add, do the birds. Horlick's,

honey, and a little Marmite added is a good food mixture, which should
not be too watery: Sunbirds lose all their activity if allowed to get
thin.
I have noticed that the female of Leptocoma asiatica also has a song,
and will sing to the male when they are paired. Nearly all the males
have a display of some sort, which consists often of an accentuation
of the dragon-fly movements, and a peculiar stroking of the flanks
with alternately spread wings, while the tail is spread and held at an
angle horizontally. When pectoral tufts are present these are brought
into prominence and are opened and closed both in flight and while
perched. I have a pair of Leptocoma asiatica in a small outdoor aviary
to themselves : they are very pleased with each other and spend
a great deal of time catching tiny insects on the wing. I have hopes
they may breed.
To turn from the Sunbirds, I should like next to mention a very
rare Tanager which I once possessed. This bird was the Black-throated
Scarlet Tanager (Rhamphocoelus nigrigularis) from the Upper Amazons,
and appears to be the only live specimen ever imported, but the
extraordinary point about it is the fact that it was as tame as the
tamest Hangnest, and would follow anyone about, or let itself be
picked up. It had the same aggressiveness as many Hangnests, and
would administer punishment if not given what it desired ! Tanagers
of this genus are always so wild and nervous that I have no doubt
this bird had been hand-reared. These large Tanagers seem easy to
feed and keep in health, but the Calliste group are difficult to keep for
any length of time. They very often seem to die just when they have
reached what appears to be perfect condition, nearly always from
digestive trouble. This is the more to be lamented as they are such
lovely and all together desirable creatures. To my mind there is little
in nature more beautiful than the sight of a Calliste fastuosa in perfect
condition literally flashing from perch to perch. When really fit the
bird seems to bounce from place to place so quickly that at times
it appears hardly to touch one branch before it has reached another.
I have two rather rare examples in Chlorophonia frontalis and
C. occipitalis , the former from Venezuela and the latter from Mexico.
After the Sunbirds and Tanagers the birds of prey are my favourites

in captivity. Most of the species I have kept have been British, the
best of which was a young female Hen-harrier. I procured the bird
in the North of Scotland while out Partridge shooting : it rose from i
under some whins and I realized at once what it was, but before 1
I could shout " Don't shoot " it had been winged by the gun next to
me. I refused to allow the keeper to kill it and determined to take
it home in a game-bag and try and make it live, as the species is extinct
as a breeding bird on the mainland, although it breeds in Orkney,
whence this immature bird had undoubtedly wandered. After a week
it would jump on to the wrist and was tame enough to travel loose
in the car to London, spending en route a night in my room at a hotel
in Carlisle, sleeping on a wood basket. The bad wing was very difficult
to heal and it was washed and dressed twice a day, the Harrier meanwhile
remaining motionless, and seemingly a better patient than many humans
would have been in similar painful circumstances.
Of foreign species I have only had the Central African Pigmy Falcon
(Poliohierax semitorquatus), and the Himalayan Red-legged Falconet
(Microhierax coerulescens) : the latter I possess at the present time,
and it is certainly the smaller kind of the two. These small Falcons
are very delicate, more so as regards food than temperature, and
unless they are constantly supplied with small birds, mice, and lizards
live only a very short time. But I am sure almost all birds of prey
will become very tame if trouble is taken. But it is no good looking
at them and expecting them suddenly to be aware of their owners'
goodness of heart. The only method is that used in the days of falconry :
to get hold of the bird and carry it about where there are many surprises
and most noise. To do this the bird must either be hooded or prevented
from flying by a clipped wing. The latter operation spoils the appearance
of the bird, but it is surely better to have a Hawk that will jump readily
on to its owner's wrist and love to be carried about, than one that will
dash at the bars of its cage when looked at.
Other families with which I am well acquainted are the Honeyeaters,
the best of which to my mind is the Spine-bill ( Acanthorhynchus
tenuirostris). A bird with more lovely movements it would be difficult
to mention : it is hardy and might possibly breed in an outdoor aviary,
were a pair ever to be imported. There is a male in the Zoological

Gardens which appears to want to breed, and which is in very fine
condition. This bird was very weak when it arrived last spring. I had
it in Scotland for a time and fed it largely on spiders, which are no
doubt responsible for a rather remarkable recovery.
Of Flycatchers, Warblers, and Thrushes I have had many species,
including the Yellow, Black and White Xanthopygia xanthopygia
from the Malay States, the little Indian Pied Flycatcher (Cyornis
melanoleuca melanoleuca), which is doing well at present--it has
a pretty song and appears to be hardy, the Guatemalan Thrush-Robin
with a lovely Hermit-thrush-like song, and Eopsaltria australis from
Victoria.
Of the Shrikes, a quaint and very interesting example was Smith's
Helmet Shrike (Prionops talacoma), which proved as expert at catching
mealworms in the air as any Drongo.
I have also possessed at one time and another several of the
Paradisiidse, including Lophorina superha lattipennis, Cicinnurus
regius, Astrarchia rothschildi, and Diphyllodes magnifica. But I believe
I shall never again keep Paradise Birds ; they are too costly and require
such a quantity of fruit ; moreover it is difficult to provide them with
the right atmosphere, without which the moult is rarely successful.
If I may I should like to exhort those aviculturists who are lucky
enough to procure Sunbirds to pay special attention to the winter
and summer change of plumage, for this is a subject about which very
little is known. I myself am satisfied that the following species lose
the breeding plumage for part of the year : Nectarinia pulchella,
Nectarinia famosa (sometimes), Leptocoma asiatica asiatica,
L. a. intermedia, and Cinnyris bifasciatus microrhynchus (although
some collectors say they have never seen it out of colour at any time
of the year in East Africa). I should be very grateful for any
information from aviculturists on this question, especially as regards
the large and small Double-collared ( C. afer and chalybceus) and the
Malachite [Nectarinia famosa).

Spring arrived with a glorious March, and how busy we all were in
our aviaries with their gardens, turning over the soil, removing large
old shrubs and planting new, small, and sweet-scented flowering
ones in their place. Primroses are also a great joy to small birds,
for all the wee mites love picking off the flower-heads, not only for the
nectar they contain, but for the sheer joy of seeing them strewn on
the ground as a carpet for their loved mates to walk on ; surely no
one could grudge them that, seeing how much we also appreciate
beautiful things around us--our very birds, flowers, etc. In Cornwall
things grow at such a rate that a stick from the hedge stuck into the
ground--as a mark--becomes almost a young tree in a week !
Extremely trying at times I can assure you.
My birds all delight in a flower garden, and it seems to me to
encourage them to go to nest. At present I have Avadavats,
Gold-breasts, Bengalese, Cordon Bleus, Yiolet-ears, Pectoral and
Zebra Finches all sitting, also my St. Helena and Orange-cheek
Waxbills, their third year together. The Lavenders not only fly about
looking very pretty, but are also very mischievous. As for the
Violet-ears, they sit so frequently and so long with never a single
result that they always remind me of the tale of the fisherman, when
sitting beside a stream outside the grounds of an asylum. A head
popped up over the wall and asked, " Have you caught anything ? "
" No." " How long have you been at it ? " " Six hours." " Come
inside then."
The jolly Pekin Eobins are only now thinking of furnishing their
house. I think seeing the Shamas having the free use of the garden
and orchard has reminded them of the freedom they had last year.
I think at this point I may say a few words on Shamas, my pair being
truly delightful birds. About the end of October last I brought them
into the greenhouse adjoining the sitting-room ; each had its own
cage for eating and sleeping in, but all day long they had their freedom
with a pair of Persian Bulbuls, a Superb and a Scarlet Tanager. The

latter I have had for nearly seven years now, and I consider him one
of my most gorgeous birds. The sitting-room is also at their disposal
and I must add that Shamas are so clean that I am sure no one need
fear having them loose in their sitting-rooms. If they fly through an
open window they very soon come back. They never fight--if Jean
gets hold of a nice fat spider, of course Jim too wants it ; he makes
a dive at her, but has never yet hurt her, and she flies off to the top
of the greenhouse and there consumes her delicacy. While I was at
the Palace Show my husband lost Jean, but on going upstairs found
her singing in her sweet way perched on the head of my bed, probably
looking for Jim and me.
I put out both Shamas in the middle of March, into their own
aviary, which measures 12x6x7 to 9 ft. high. The shelter
is quite a miniature affair, standing on legs about 3 ft. long. Jean was
usually inside and Jim underneath where I had fixed a perch. The
nest-box is outside. I watched them closely for a day or two. The
courtship is alarmingly savage and might very well be taken for
a terrific " dust-up ". Within a few days eggs were laid, and now
there are four youngsters still in the nest. The parent birds delight
in following us all round the garden, always appreciating company,
and on very wet days frequently fly through the greenhouse into the
sitting-room, where Jim bursts into song. He is here at this moment,
and now comes Jean. I consider the Shama a most delightful bird
to keep and they seem to so enjoy their life of so-called captivity.
My Shamas are not at all keen on housemaids. I think because they
kill spiders under their very beaks ! If you treat a Shama as a pal
he will treat you as one, and what could be nicer.

By The Marquess of Tavistock
Since the sexes in a wild state are presumably about equal it is
one of the unsolved mysteries of aviculture why practically all captive
Grey Parrots should be hens.
For years Canon Dutton's old Polly has occupied a small aviary
in my collection. Sheltered only from direct wind and wet she has

passed unscathed through the severest winters, for, properly fed, the
Grey Parrot is the hardiest foreign bird you can put into an aviary.
I have only lost one in the open and that was by an accident, and
have never had one ill. If the ability of Grey Parrots to stand our
climate out-of-doors were more widely recognized probably more
people would keep them in that way and the birds would be healthier
and happier. Unlike Amazons, they do not forget their talking
accomplishments when living in the open, but continue to pick up
any conversation or sounds they may hear. A Grey Parrot is content
in quite a small aviary as it does not seem to be particularly keen
on flying, but the wire netting must be of a really stout gauge and all
exposed woodwork protected with zinc, as they bite wood almost as
persistently as Cockatoos. Perches, of course, can be renewed as they
are chewed up.
For some years I made no particular effort to find Polly a mate,
realizing that the task was well-nigh hopeless, but her laying and
patient incubation of two clutches of eggs in one season encouraged
me to make the attempt. The first cock was supposed to have been
sexed by an expert. " He " certainly had a larger and heavier beak
than Polly, who is a particularly feminine-looking Grey with
a small beak and a very elliptical eye. Having had some experience
of stormy introductions between Amazons, even when of opposite
sexes, I was very uncertain how Polly would greet a member of
her race after her long period of solitude. However, after a little
preliminary squabbling they settled down to tolerate one another,
though they never displayed any affection. In due course the new
Parrot came into breeding condition and proved an unmistakable
female.
Some time afterwards Miss Knobel discovered a bird she believed
by the pelvic bone test to be a certain cock. Although I got " him "
rather late in the year for turning out, I decided to risk " him " in
the aviary. Polly's reception of " him " was much like that of " his "
predecessor, although " he " was anxious to make friends. The new
arrival prospered and was soon in perfect plumage, but one winter
night met with a mysterious accident, being found dead next morning
with- an injured claw and a pool of blood nearby. On post-mortem

" he 55 also proved a hen, showing that the pelvic test, though often
useful, is not wholly to be relied on.
Some months later I saw an enormous Grey in Harrods and
determined to have him. Foolishly, however, I delayed in making
my purchase, and when I returned he was gone. I believe he really
was a cock ! I took a smaller bird, but as it was very feminine in
body-shape and squabbled with Polly even more than usual I decided
not to persevere.
Finally, Bill. The other day a letter reached me from the owner
of a Parrot who said he had a bird in breeding condition and would
I like to have it ? He felt sure from its actions it was a male. Bill is
still an uncertain quantity. If he is a cock then none of the supposed
indications of sex in the appearance of Grey Parrots are reliable. He is
a smallish bird and there is nothing about the shape of the bare skin
round the eye nor of the eye itself to separate him from his predecessors.
The day after his arrival he was exceedingly restless, making strenuous
efforts to get out of his cage and starting to pluck himself with much
energy. I had meant to keep him indoors till the weather was milder,
but he made such a mess of himself that I felt I had better risk him
in the aviary. Polly's greeting at first was less unfriendly than usual.
She went up and looked at him and then, without molesting him,
turned and walked away for a couple of feet and, hanging on the
wire, examined him closely first with one eye and then with the other.
He responded to these observations by uttering a single--not very
loud--whistle at frequent intervals. Later in the day Polly was less
polite, pecking him on the head when he tried to share her food dish
and giving him a tweak when he turned to walk away, unfriendly acts
which he endured rather patiently. Now, a few days later, he is
evidently beginning to respond to fresh air and good feeding. He has
stopped plucking himself and is developing a bad temper towards
humans, biting the wire, scooping out mouthfuls of rotten wood, and
delivering himself of a tuneless Gregorian chant strangely like that
wherewith Koko, the Amazon, of unblessed memory, was wont to
defy me. I may grow to value Bill but I do not think I shall ever like
him. I foresee that he will join the ranks of the man-eaters !

BREEDING PROSPECTS FOR 1933

By Maurice Amsler, M.B., F.Z.S.
An S 0 S for copy this morning from our Editor left me somewhat
puzzled for the choice of a subject. Last year's successes were few,
apart from half a score of Blue Robins, some Gouldians, and some
200 Budgerigars. I have, therefore, decided to walk round my cages
and somewhat depleted aviaries and to discuss my breeding prospects
for the year. This is so much pleasanter than a retrospect, for at this
early date one can hardly have any failures or disappointments to
register.
First in my bird-room I have my old Blue Rock Thrush, whose
mousing activities were recently described in the Avicultural
Magazine. Having disposed of some 20 or 30 mice of various sizes
in his outdoor aviary, I did him the unkindness to catch him up and
cage him. Being predatory on mice I argued that he would not turn
up his bill at a young Roller Canary, several pairs of which species
shared his aviary with him. I had often noticed that I was the world's
worst breeder of Canaries, and I now suspect that my old Thrush
has been for the past few years responsible for my non-success.
In adjacent cages are five or six pairs of Gouldian Finches--the
sexes separate as far as is possible--but all my young of last year
are still in their nestling plumage, and therefore unsexed. I fear
a preponderance of males, as many of them occasionally break out
into song and dance. Together with these are two pairs of Long-tailed
Grass Finches.
These and two hen Gouldian Finches are from Chapman's last
importation, and I must say that his collector is to be congratulated
on the condition of all these imported birds, which reminded me of
Payne and Wallace's faultless collections some twenty-four years ago.

Close by a cage containing a Hooded Siskin, mated to two White
Border Canaries, both of which are now sitting on full clutches.
I have hopes of these nests as I have frequently seen the Siskin
feeding both Canaries. 1
It is a pity that the Hooded Siskin is so delicate on its arrival
in England. My present cock is all I have left of two apparently good
pairs purchased last year. Both hens nested and died either before or
during incubation. In 1912 I successfully bred these birds for the
first time in Great Britain, but my pair of Siskins then was one which
had been in the country for two or three years and was thoroughly
acclimatized.
A pair of (?) New Guinea Parrotlets, waiting for the warmer
weather to go outdoors, spend a good deal of their time either
cuddling or bickering.
Two quite small cages contain each a pair of Blue Eobins nesting,
one couple now on its second clutch.
Two pairs of Bengalese are busy nesting, and I hope may later on
help to rear either Grass Finches or Gouldian Finches.
Last, but not least, comes " Wally ", my old Senegal Parrot.
He has been here for years and has never had a feather out of place
or a day's sickness, although he gets all the various foods forbidden
by Lord Tavistock, i.e. tea, cake, sugar dipped in coffee, and occasionally
a bit of fried egg at breakfast. A mealworm is perhaps the greatest
treat one can offer him.
This bird is quite a character. He says a few words, lies on his
back and clasps his hands in prayer, and does various acrobatic tricks
on a pencil. Any strange man can handle him with impunity, but
I grieve to say he is a misogynist and will set about any member of
the fair sex, even a baby, although quite friendly with a boy of the
same age.
One end of my greenhouse is wired off into two small aviaries each
some 9 ft. long. Here I have at present a pair of Blue Eobins and a pair
of Shamas. I use these aviaries, which are slightly heated, when I wish
to start birds breeding early, but the results do not always work out
according to plan. The Shamas, for instance, have been playing at

nesting for the past six weeks, whereas another pair, the hen of which
was only purchased from Mr. Frost some three weeks ago, have
a completed nest, and now have eggs.
The Blue Robins in this aviary have also been disappointing, the
cock, who was an adult bird in 1926, is still in perfect breeding condition
and magnificent plumage, but I had the sad misfortune to lose his
original mate last winter, a substitute which I obtained from a kind
friend, while accepting all his attentions (which included many
mealworms), appeared a little weak in flight and refused to build.
After wasting much time I bought back a 1931 hen of my own breeding,
which I substituted for this unsatisfactory bird, and within fourteen
days I am able to report a nest containing five eggs.
Four aviaries from 8 to 20 ft. long are given up to Budgerigars
in their different colour varieties. These are " seed-winners ", by
which I mean that they pay their way, even with the present over-
production, and enable one to purchase a few birds occasionally without
encroaching on one's banking account.
This leaves four larger aviaries some 30 by 10 ft., each of which
is about equally divided, between flight and shelter.
In No. 1 I have a pair of Shamas nesting as already mentioned,
a pair of Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Doves, which produced fertile eggs
last year but no young. This year I have in No. 3 aviary two pairs of
Barbary Doves, which I intend to use as foster-parents. The only
other occupants of No. 1 are a pair of Siberian Bullfinches, which
I have had for many years. These have nested and hatched young on
several occasions, but have never succeeded completely. Last summer
I caged these birds and by giving them their liberty alternately induced
the hen to build in a cypress-tree in my garden, after which I liberated
both birds. Eggs were laid, but unfortunately some marauder,
possibly a jackdaw, destroyed the eggs, and I had to catch up both
birds again as the season was advanced and I did not expect any more
nesting.
In No. 2 aviary I have a few pairs of Roller Canaries and a few
odd Serins which may or may not produce hybrids. It was in this aviary
that my Blue Rock Thrushes bred in 1931, and again with only partial
success in 1932.

No. 3 aviary is practically empty except for the two pairs of
Barbary Doves and a hen Sulphury Seed-eater mated to a cock
Greenfinch. She was sold to me as a cock and a fine singer some four
years ago. It is quite true she sings--after a fashion--but she has
proved her sex each season, including the present one, by building
a nest and incubating a clutch of eggs. Last summer I caught a cock
Greenfinch for her. Being a bird of somewhat similar build and colour
I hoped they might mate, but I have seen him making love to a wild
hen through the aviary wires, so fear my plans will not mature.
The last of my larger aviaries contains a collection of Waxbills
and two White-fronted Doves. Whether these are a pair or not I am
not sure. I understand from Mrs. Astley, who gave them to me, that
they are ready breeders, but so far I have seen no signs of building or
display on the part of the bird I consider to be the male.
There is still one more small enclosure which I have failed to
mention which is just a wire flight, some 10 by 4 ft., without any
real shelter, and which opens direct into the garden. It is here that
I place any pair of birds which I want to breed at semi-liberty. In this
aviary and in this manner I have successfully reared Great Tits, Orchard
Finches, Green Cardinals, the American Robin (TUrdus migratorius ),
and the Blue Robin, the last on numerous occasions. If I lived in the
country and had more time I should erect a number of these small
wire flights, well apart one from the other to prevent fighting between
their respective occupants. There is, of course, always a risk of losing
one's birds which perhaps adds spice to the experiment, but once
there are young to feed the danger of straying is a very small one.
Such is the devotion of birds to their offspring that we are all familiar
with the fuss and bill-clicking which occurs when we inspect a nest
of almost any insectivorous bird, and it is with this class of bird in
particular that I should employ semi-liberty, on account of the much
greater variety of food which a free bird can supply to its young.
It is an undoubted fact that birds so reared are much larger and more
vigorous than those bred in a closed aviary on a diet of mealworms,
ants' eggs, and any other live food which its hard-working owner
can collect.

The Cuban Finch is too well enough known to aviculturalists of
this country, from pictures at any rate, to need any description as to
appearance. It is not to be found, however, in as many aviaries as it
deserves. The reason for this is probably that it is not by any means
a common bird. It can be purchased when it appears on the market
for from 20s. to 40s. a pair, the former price being rather below the
average for newly imported specimens. It is often hard to establish
when newly imported, but later it becomes hardy. Anyone who has
not already kept some of these birds will find that they are among the
most interesting of the smaller Finches. They are ever on the move
and have always a busy disposition as they hop and flit about. They
continually twitter, which has, I suppose, given them their exaggerated
name of &amp;lt;# Melodious " Finch. Their song--if their few notes may be
thus termed--is anything but " melodious It is certainly rather
pleasing, more from the fact that it gives one the idea that they consider
life worth living, and mean to tell you so, than from a musical point
of view. While one is explaining this to you his body is being oscillated
from side to side, which is also rather quaint. True pairs are very fond
of each other and are continually close together. They usually build
a nest fairly soon, and if the hen does not lay in it at once it will be
used by both as sleeping quarters. It is usual for a pair to start family
operations soon and they lay from two to four eggs. Some hens are
never to be caught on the nest ; they seem to be off at the sound of
a step many yards away, yet the chicks hatch in the normal time.
Others sit very closely indeed and as the nest is of domed type it is
very hard to ascertain if all is well. As these birds are seldom troubled

with egg-binding, this is not a great problem. The nest is a very neat
one. The hen does the sitting, the cock joining her at night. In an
aviary with other small Finches and Waxbills they stand a good chance
of breeding. They are quite capable of defending their house and home
and usually will not worry other birds. Beware, however, of putting
two pairs in the same aviary, or even two odd birds of the same sex ;
if you make this mistake it is more than likely that the stock of these
birds therein will be reduced to half. This is their one failing--so far
as I have discovered. In Butler's Foreign Finches it is stated that these
birds are fond of mealworms, but they are probably better without
them. I took this advice, but when the eggs were hatched I thought
a few would help matters, so about four were given daily. The three
young birds died one by one, the last being almost feathered. Much
the same thing took place with a second pair. Thinking perhaps that
they were not getting enough live food, the quantity was doubled next
time and insectile mixture was used. They did not eat much of the
latter, but in a short time finished up the mealworms. The results were
no better. With one or two more failures ended 1931.
During last winter there was plenty of time to think things over.
I resolved, therefore, to try breeding in 1932 without any additional
live food to that picked up by the birds in the aviary. On reflection,
it had come to my mind that several winters ago I kept a pair of Cubans
in a cage. This pair hatched and reared one young bird during the
months of January and February. I had no mealworms at the time.
The pair, which were later involved in an accident causing their death,
were considered an abnormal pair. Why this opinion was formed is
of interest. The birds were purchased from the continent. Part of their
journey to Randalstown was in an aeroplane ; nevertheless, for some
reason they were held up somewhere and the complete trip took them
four and a half days. When they arrived I was surprised to find that
they had built a nest in the corner of their travelling box which was
only about 8 by 8 by 4 in. It was not much of a nest, it is true,
but " one cannot make bricks without straw ". It was, however,
typical in form though rather flimsy. The only materials at their disposal
were the sponge from their water-pot, bits of millet sprays, and pieces
of a sticky paper label which was attached to the inside of the box, and

threads from the muslin front of the box. It was much more like a
nest than it sounds, even if it was a bit on the lines of a mouse's.
On arrival they were transferred at once to a flight cage and given
some nesting material. By the following evening the nest was ready
for the roof, which went on the next morning.
I cannot say when the eggs were laid, but in three weeks from the
day of arrival there was a chick and an egg in the nest, the former had
probably hatched the previous day. Furthermore, this chick was reared
to independence--unfortunately it did not live to see the spring.
Up to the present few remarks have been made on the all-important
feeding question. There is little to say really, as they will eat all the
usual seeds. It is well to keep off the mealworms as I think the 1932
results will show. It is, of course, a pity that there were not one or
two more pairs of birds, as the results might have been more conclusive.
There were just two pairs ; both were fed with canary, white millet,,
Indian millet, a few sprays of millet, red millet, mixed seeds (sold as
British Finch Mixture) and weed seeds. The only extra was a small
pot of brown sugar of which the birds are very fond. No. 1 pair were
supplied with mealworms while there were young birds in the nest.
No. 2 pair had no mealworms. No. 1 pair had four nests without
rearing any youngsters, though seven were hatched. Only one actually
left the nest. No. 2 pair had two nests, and reared one in the first from
two eggs and two in the second from three. There is plenty of room in
this experiment for coincidence. Others may have found the reverse
to be the case and if this is so it will be interesting to hear. It is my
purpose in writing these notes to state what has happened here for
what it is worth, and if anyone can tell me a better way to treat my birds
I shall be more than pleased. It is to this end which we all are working,
and by telling facts as we find them is the surest way to advance.
It was mentioned further back that Cuban Finches will have a
" battle royal " if there are more than a pair in each aviary. This
must be enlarged upon a little. When the young leave the nest both
parents are very kind to them ; this is not by any means permanent..
It lasts roughly until the hen nests again. At the laying of the first
egg, or perhaps until she starts sitting, they are safe--it seems to vary.
With the original pair which nested in the winter it was the first egg ;

with the 1932 No. 2 pair it was not until the hen started sitting that
the trouble began.
In each case it was quite definite--it is that the cock takes a sudden
dislike to his sons and daughters, and he is not the least backward
about showing it either. When this happens they must be removed
at once, if not, he will save any trouble by doing it himself, but to
a better land ! It is unusual for this to take place before the young
can " do " for themselves, I understand, and it has certainly been
so here.
Young birds learn to eat Millet Sprays before anything else, there-
fore it is well to supply them with plenty before the trouble begins
and after they have been removed. I hope to carry on with Cuban
Finches in 1933, as they are very interesting and likeable in every way ;
the sort of bird to which the critical visitor who knows nothing about
birds, takes a fancy at once.
There is an unusual state of affairs, the reason for which has so
far eluded me--it is that hen Cuban Finches can be obtained more
easily than cocks. Are they imported in larger numbers, or are the cocks
more delicate ? Possibly the answer is neither of these, but that the
cocks are such devils for fighting among themselves, they kill each
other off. It would be interesting to have an importer's views on this
point.

On 3rd April there arrived in the London Docks, en route for
Hamburg, a consignment of Penguins from the Falkland Islands,
and amongst them was an example of the Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes
forsteri), the first of its kind to reach Europe. Mr. Sidney Castang
met the collection for Messrs. Hagenbeck and, at my request, measured
this bird. He writes me : " The Emperor Penguin was 32} inches
high when I measured it in the box and, of course, it was not standing
quite upright. I should think when he stretched his neck it would
make him 3 or 4 inches higher."
The Emperor Penguin is considerably larger than the King Penguin

driven out of its usual course by storms and was discovered in a some-
what exhausted state on the beach. It was taken home and fed by
a fisherman, and Messrs. Hagenbeck's representative, who was making
a collection of Penguins to take home to Hamburg, hearing of it, was
not slow in acquiring it, and I am told it arrived in excellent condition.

SHAMA ATTACKING MOUSE

<bodyText confidence="0.973968192307692" page_id="56237464"  page_num="170" year="" vol="">
In the March number of the Avictjltural Magazine appeared a note
from me concerning the killing of mice by a Blue Rock Thrush. At that
time I picked up several dead mice in the adjoining aviary and imagined
that these had been damaged by the Thrush and had crawled through the
wire-netting dividing the two aviaries, and had died from their injuries.
Some ten days ago I noticed a cock Shama in this aviary dancing about
on the ground and evidently attacking something. On closer inspection
I found that his attentions were directed against a three-quarter grown
mouse which escaped up a privet bush while I watched. Meantime
I had called up my man and a friend who is a member of the Avicultural
Society, and we saw the Shama fly into the bush and again attack the mouse,
which then jumped back to the ground, where the Shama quickly battered
it to death by a series of vicious pecks.

SPICE FINCH AND GRASSFINCH MATING
It may interest members of the Avicultural Society that I think with
any luck I shall be introducing a new kind of Finch ; but, of course, the cross
may have been done before, viz. a Spice Finch and a Long-tailed Grassfinch.
So far I have not been able to ascertain with any certainty which their
sexes are. The Grassfinch, I discovered this morning, was sitting on the eggs,
and its mate was hovering close by, and I have no other Grassfinch in the
aviary, but certainly the nest was put together by the Spice Finch. I find
these little birds make no end of nests just for the spree of the thing, which
mostly consist of large pieces of bamboo twigs. My Zebra Finches are hard
at it at the moment, and nothing seems to daunt them.

busily preening the feathers of her rump. The Golden-back takes up his
position just behind her and a little to one side and, holding his head low,
keeps it close to hers, uttering sibilant noises and occasionally making a quick
lunge at her as though to bite, though without doing so, an action which also
forms part of his normal display. Occasionally, though not very often, the
hen will interrupt her pretended toilet to give his head a brief nibble. The
curious thing is that this particular form of display only seems to take place
in the doorway above mentioned and never in any other part of the aviary,
not even at the entrance to the nest.
Although the Worcester's lays two or three clutches of eggs each summer
and sits patiently she has unfortunately never hatched a young one.

I hope if you ever go to Vienna that you will visit the bird-houses at the
Schonbrunn Zoo. You may get some ideas as they are well worth a visit.
All the birds of prey, Eagles, Vultures, etc., of every species live together
in an enormous aviary, where they have absolute freedom of flight and
exist in perfect amity. Many were nesting. There are huge rocks and sham
ruined castle walls and big trees--a perfectly wonderful exhibition.
In another very large aviary are all the Owls imaginable and far more
in different species than in our Zoo ; likewise all the Hawks in another aviary
by themselves. Then every kind of Tit is shown in a large aviary with
growing trees--firs, Scotch firs, etc. : Bearded Tits, Long-tailed Tits--every
possible kind I have ever heard of and all in one aviary.
In another aviary I saw Hoopoes, Crested Wrens, two kinds of
Wagtails, ordinary and French Partridges, Woodpeckers, and Nuthatches,
well kept and in natural surroundings--in some cases with a small running
stream. I was immensely interested.
Then the Crane class : Egrets, Storks (one pair building), Carrion Crows,
Magpies--all together.

A LOVEBIRD PROBLEM
I wonder if you would publish this letter in the next Avicultural
Magazine in the hope that someone may be able to help me. I have got
a Masked Lovebird--a cock--over five years old. In October I noticed him
one day in the aviary not well. I took him in and was quite sure he was
dying ; however, after giving him brandy he quite recovered and was sitting
up on his perch cleaning his feathers when he suddenly fell off, losing the
power of both his legs. Ever since he has lived in the bottom of his cage
sitting on a duster. He is in perfect feather but eats no ordinary food, only
millet spray or digestive biscuits mashed up and off a spoon. About two months
ago I began letting him out of his cage and since then he has spent the day
flying round the drawing-room. He can perch (or, rather, sit on his breast-
bone) on anything level; and he can hang on to anything by his beak. When
he is out he eats some plain canary seed and white millet, which is left on
a window ledge for some Budgerigars, and lately he has made tremendous

friends with a Tovi Parrakeet. About four years ago he and another
Black-cheeked Lovebird cock lived for a summer in a cage in the house and
spent all day free, coming home to their cage through the window in the
evening, and twice since he has spent his days in the drawing-room, where
the door is always open. He has gone out again : he was out to-day for
about four hours. He looks just like a dead leaf when he hangs swaying on
a branch, but when flying he is just as well as he ever was. I watched him
to-day light on the flat roof of the aviary and rise from it again; he pushes
himself up with his beak. At first his legs were both tight up against his
body, but to-day, when he flew over me in the garden, one leg was hanging
down ; and I fancy lately he has had a little more power in his right leg.
The trouble is that I do not know what to do to help him. He hates being
touched. To get him into his cage at night one has to wait until he is hanging
on to a picture or the window and press his cage against him. In the morning
I lift him out. I tried to force him to eat soaked seed at first, but he would
far sooner starve. I have painted his legs and rubbed them with no success;
but, apart from his legs, he is in perfect health. I've rarely seen a bird with
such a gloss on him, and he is quite fat. When he is out he goes and sits on
the Lovebird aviary and talks to them ; and to-day he came in and out of
the house several times calling to get the Tovi to follow him out, but I was
afraid of the Tovi--who is rather a fool but quite finger-tame--getting lost,
and I shut him up in his cage.
It is so pathetic to see this bird that I wish someone could help me.
I think he is quite happy now that he can fly ; but, of course, some day he'll
get taken by a cat or a Hawk, as he cannot start quickly, and if his legs get
no better I am afraid they will waste away and never have any hope of
improvement.

THE ARRIVAL OF HUMMING BIRDS

When, some two months ago, M. Delacour told me that a certain
German collector was expected to arrive in Europe towards the end
of May with a collection of Humming Birds, and that of a similar
collection which arrived a year ago the majority were still thriving
in Berlin, I determined that some should be procured for the Zoological
&apos;Gardens and that, in the meantime, a suitable place should be pre-
pared for their reception.
The chief difficulty in the past with Humming Birds has been
in maintaining a suitable temperature, for it has been proved that, with
the smaller species from the lowlands at any rate, the thermometer
should never fall below 60 degrees Eahr., the most suitable temperature
for them being from 10 to 20 degrees above this. Another supposed
difficulty arose from their reputed quarrelsomeness, for we were led
to understand that if two or more were kept in the same cage or
aviary there would be serious fighting.
With regard to their feeding, I think Mr. Ezra was the first to
prove that, other things being correct, they could be kept well on a
diluted mixture of Mellin's Food, honey, and condensed milk. Mr. Ezra
kept one in a cage in a heated bath-room in London for upwards
\0x25A0of two years. It was let out of its cage daily and always went back

of its own accord. Finally, through the window being accidentally
left open at the wrong time, it escaped and was not able to find its
way back.
In the New York Zoological Park one was kept for four years on
this diet, and its death was attributed to a failure of the electric heating
device.
As to their reputed quarrelsomeness, they certainly like to dart
at one another and make a show of fighting ; but like the squabbles
of Ruffs, most of it is bluff and does no harm. The collection in the
Berlin Gardens is kept in one fairly large indoor aviary and little
harm has been experienced through fighting ; in fact a few squabbles
help to keep the birds exercised and healthy.
As a site for a Humming Bird aviary in the London Zoo I could
think of no more suitable place than the Tropical House. Here such
birds as Sugar-birds, the more difficult Honey-eaters, Sunbirds, and
so forth have done extremely well in a damp and warm atmosphere.
So a corner of this was selected for an aviary of about 18 by
12 feet. The front was screened off with plate glass, the open
side covered with " Windolite ", and the top below the glass roof covered
with fine white mosquito netting. A ventilator near the ground
admits fresh air while the exhausted air has an exit at the top. As
a precaution against the possible failure of the hot-water heating
supply an additional electric heating apparatus has been installed.
This is thermostatically controlled so that should the temperature
fall below about 70 degrees Fahr. the electric heater comes into action.
The place has been planted with flowers and a fountain installed.
Regarding further the feeding of Humming Birds, I have said that
their principal food consists of a mixture of syrup, and it is important
that this should not be allowed to soil their plumage or they would
very soon suffer. It must be given in a vessel which has an opening
of not more than about one-eighth of an inch so that the birds can
insert their bills only. If given in an open dish they would become
terribly sticky. I think it was the German importer who devised
the particular feeding bottles that are now used. They are well shown
in the photographs and work on the principle of the poultry drinkers
one sometimes sees, where the water remains at a constant level at

the small drinking outlet, the reservoir being airtight. These bottles
are used in the cages in which Hummers are imported, placed outside
in a small wooden frame, the small nozzle at the bottom projecting
through the bars. When hung up in the aviary the birds spotted
them at once and hovering before them inserted their beaks and sucked
up the syrup.
In the article which follows Captain Stokes describes the meeting
of these birds at Havre and it only remains for me to record their
arrival and subsequent behaviour in London. The Zoological Society
is very greatly indebted to M. Delacour for arranging the details of
the collection of this consignment and for allowing Overseer Bailey
to make Cleres his headquarters from which to collect the birds and
subsequently transport them to the Zoological Gardens ; in fact,
without his kind help it would have been very difficult, if not
impossible, to have obtained them. Sincere thanks are due also to
Captain Stokes for the great help he gave.
Captain Stokes and Bailey arrived safely with a collection of
twenty Humming Birds, all apparently in excellent condition and none
the worse for their voyage. Their cages were placed in the new aviary,
but it was thought advisable not to liberate them until the next day,
when the cages were opened and they were not slow in shooting out
with their curious, insect-like flight. They at once commenced to
buzz about, examining and sampling the flowers, hovering round the
feeders, and drinking the syrup or playfully darting at a companion.
The fountain was a great joy to them and they delighted in dashing
through the spray or perching on the edge of the basin and bathing ;
or they would hover round its sides, sucking up the drops of
water as they trickled over. Their flight is remarkably insect-like,
as one will hover in front of a flower, motionless, except for the wings,
which vibrate so rapidly as to be almost invisible, then shoot forward,
sideways or even backwards. One is reminded irresistibly of some large
moth, especially the Humming-bird Hawk Moth, which is in its shape
and actions a replica of a small Humming Bird.
Two of the Hummers died two days after their arrival, and a post
mortem examination showed that death was due to fatty degeneration
of the liver--too rich food, so we diluted the syrup with twice the

quantity of water advised by the importer. We also discontinued
the use of sugar in addition to the Mellin's, honey, and condensed milk,
all of which contain sugar, and up to the present the birds have shown
every sign of good health and spirits. The food they are having now
consists of one dessert spoonful of the three above ingredients, a
pinch of Liebig's Extract of Meat, and a pinch of powdered charcoal,
mixed with half a pint of hot water. This, when cooled, is poured
into the bottles and is changed for a fresh supply after about four
hours. In the evening honey and water is substituted and left in
the aviary until the following morning.
In addition to this syrup diet the birds are supplied with such
insect food as green fly and fruit-flies. They are also given an assort-
ment of flowers.
The species that the Zoological Society has obtained are as

And I must readily admit that when I went into the treasure
room I felt like the Queen of Sheba among the riches of Solomon--
there was no more spirit in me. There they were, rows of emeralds
and rubies and sapphires and topaz, flashing and irridescent, and every
jewel of them a living Humming Bird, 200 of them !
And not Humming Birds with frayed wings and sticky plumage
flopping piteously about in dirty cages, but everyone in show condition
and perfect. They were the property of a German dealer who had
caught them in Brazil for distribution among the fortunate ones of
Europe. They travelled in a nice warm room on the boat, in charming
little wicker cages about 15 inches square and about four birds to a
cage. The cage floors were covered with clean paper, and the birds
were fed from glass bottles corked at the top and with a tiny up-
turned glass mouth painted red at the bottom.
The food in the bottles was a mixture of honey, sugar, Mellin's
food, Leibig's extract, and water, with a little powdered charcoal to
keep it sweet. The exact components I do not know, but I am quite
sure the London Zoo would supply the details.
The bottles were washed out three times daily with silver sand,
and filled each time with fresh food. Every bird in each cage was
able to take ample flying exercise, and did so without any stupid
banging about or injury to itself.
The temperature of their room was between 75 and 85 degrees
Eahr., and the dealer told us they would stand another 20
degrees with the utmost enjoyment, but would become torpid and
unable to fly at anything below 60 degrees. The birds seemed to
dip their beaks into the food at very short intervals, and most of them
fed while hovering.
The next thing was to sort out what we had settled to buy. Twenty
each for M. Delacour and the London Zoo and a dozen more for two
private aviarists were soon caught and recaged by the nimble hands
of Bailey, who took upon himself and carried out with the utmost
care and cleverness their safe transport to their new homes. A three-
hour drive by motor to Cleres, going very gingerly with all the windows
closed ; the arrival there just before dark when the side of the crate
was removed and oil lamps placed by it for the treasures to feed by ;

the gradual dimming of the lamps while fifty pairs of little wings were
still buzzing; the extinguishing of the lights while four humans
listened to hear if every bird was still and safe on its perch for the
night ; all this was something new and thrilling in bird-keeping and
a great experience for me.
They were housed in M. Delacour's greenhouse aviary. The next
morning was fixed for our departure for London, and 4.30 a.m. saw
Bailey and Fooks up and working at the birds. M. Delacour and I
joined them in our pyjamas, and every bird (and a great many others
too besides Humming Birds) were fed and watered. Two hours after
sunrise we were working in a temperature of 115 degrees sun and fire
heat, and I fear we were much thirstier than the birds !
We left by car for the Dieppe boat, on which by the kindness of
the captain we got a nice warm bathroom for the birds. The Zoo
van met us at Victoria and the precious cargo was safely landed by
6.30 p.m.
A compartment of the Tropical Bird and Plant House had been
specially prepared for the " Hummers ", charming with flowers and ferns
and a fountain, and well furnished with spriggy branches. The next
morning the cages were opened and every bird flew out, buzzing like
a winged beetle. And what happened ? Did they flop about and
bang and crouch and shiver with fright ? Not a bit. They fought
harmlessly, they sipped their nectar, they bathed in the dewy leaves
and splashed in the fountain, and hummed and buzzed as in their
native forest.
The German dealer said he had ten species on the boat, but we
brought neither the largest nor the very smallest, fearing that they
would either bully or be bullied. (The smallest had bodies little bigger
than bumble bees !)
I have since heard from M. Delacour that his are quite happy and
doing well in his greenhouse, which is far hotter than the London
Zoo cage. So let no moist and perspiring humans, eschewing Turkish
bath atmospheres, try fresh-air cures or spartan treatment for the
little Hummers, or our treasures will die and our experience and our
labour of love be wasted.

NOTES ON THE SMALL BIRDS IN THE

In the last two or three years, in fact since I have started keeping
delicate small birds in a Tropical house, with heat and moisture
amongst a rich vegetation, a good many rare and little known
species have come to me to be tried there, with good results as a rule.
To the primitive house, which includes two divisions, another one,
much warmer, with double glass all over to avoid quick changes in the
temperature, has been added this year. The new house consists of a
central part with four separate flights on each side, a large water-lily
pool and aquaria, and at the end a smaller compartment, warmer
still, for very delicate birds--Humming Birds particularly.
The great difficulty in such accommodations is to associate satis-
factorily the different sorts of birds and to avoid altogether that the
vegetation be soiled and damaged, and also that the food of certain
birds does not interfere with the health of others. This last draw-
back is specially serious in the case of nectar-eating birds, Zosterops,
Fruit-suckers, Sun, Sugar, and Humming Birds, whose food (Mellin's
food, honey, and milk) is eagerly eaten by others such as Tanagers and
Starlings, with the result that the latter soon become ill and die.
Therefore, it is only safe to associate them with species which will not
touch their sop, such as insectivorous birds and seed-eaters. At present
I put with them Fairy Bluebirds, Niltavas, Minivets, Tits, different
Chats and Kobins, Shamas, Pittas, Clarinos, Manakins, and such like,
but Tanagers, particularly, cannot live in their company for any
length of time, especially Callistes, such as Superb, Tri-coloured,
Festives, etc.
I now keep a few Seed-eaters in my first Tropical house. Although
most of them prove impossible as they cut leaves, I have found that
Bainbow and Indian Crested Buntings are very satisfactory ; also
Chinese Painted Quails, which look lovely as they walk among the
plants, Bartlett's and Marquesas Doves. With them live the old
Fork-tail, tame and beautiful, a Blue-tailed Pitta, a White-capped
Bedstart, a pair of Niltavas, a Clarino, a pair of Fairy Bluebirds, at

present nesting, a Ruby-throat, some beautiful Manakins and Yellow-
winged Sugar Birds, and a Senegal Sunbird. Peace reigns in this
community and not a leaf is damaged by the birds. The next com-
partment bouses only a breeding pair of tame Sbamas and a fine Red-
breasted Sunbird ( C . gutturalis), wbicb there retains his brilliant scarlet
gorget at the moult, but is so spiteful as to kill any weaker bird.
The central part of the new house, which is connected with the old
one by a glass covered passage, contains a breeding pair of Purple
Sugar-birds, a Vigor, Sunbird, finger-tame, a pair of Larger Minivets,
one Lesser Mini vet (P. cinnamomeus) , a pair of Tickell's, one White-
browed and one Blue-throated, Blue Fly-catchers, a pair of Red-
headed Tits (JEgithaliscus concinnus iredalei), a Blue-headed Robin
(Adelura coeruleocephala) , a Plumbeous Redstart, and a true pair of
Hooded Pittas. In the latter the male is much larger, brighter, and
bolder-looking than the hen. At first they fought badly ; now they
live, each in a part of the house, its territory in a state of armed peace,
which I hope will soon change into one of a happy married life. To
them have been added a pair of Black and White Manakins (Manacus
manacus) and some Humming Birds, such as Eupetomena glaucis,
Pygmornis, Thalurania , Lampornis, and Hylocharis .
In the side aviaries, which do not contain any vegetation but are
surrounded by creepers and other tall plants, there are a Rifle Bird of
Paradise and a very pretty Yellow-legged Ouzel (Turdus flavipes) from
Brazil, rare Barbets Megalcema lagrandieri, which I caught in Laos,
and a Brazilian species ( Capito aurovirens) ; although of very different
sizes they agree well, but will attack wickedly all other birds. Another
compartment houses several species of Zosterops, Fruit-suckers and
Sugar-birds, and a Senegal Sunbird, while other Sunbirds live in
cages ; another flight is given up to a large and varied population.
Black-throated Cardinals (P. gularis), a very rare small species,

smaller Tanagers. The special Humming-birds' compartment contains

Agyrtria, Hylocharis, Chlorostilbon, Melanotrochilus , Eulampis, and
Polytmus.
The collection of stoves-plants growing in dry walls and beds,
and on trees, is quite interesting, and the more ornamental
species are represented. They grow luxuriantly, being thoroughly
wetted morning and evening. Of course, care must be taken that
perches do not overhang them too much and any soiled leaf be washed
every day ; but it is not really difficult to keep them clean if the
house is not overcrowded, which, of course, must be carefully avoided.
The condition of birds kept under such conditions is wonderful.
The newly arrived ones are always put in the warmer place for some
time. No matter how dirty and poor they may look at first, after a
few days they become clean and bright. So far, even weak and sick
ones have recovered quickly and losses are practically now extinct.
Two of my houses contain large deep pools, but I have never been
bothered with drowning accidents. The edge of the pools is, of course,
shallow all round, and care is always taken that newly arrived birds
with imperfect wings are not let out where there is deep water. But
with good fliers I never have had any trouble. I am glad to see that
several zoos and amateurs, particularly Mr. J. H. Gurney, are also
trying to keep birds in similar Tropical houses, and I am sure that
they will be very successful, both from the point of view of the condition
of birds and of the pleasure of seeing them in much prettier and more
natural surroundings than it has so far been the case with birds kept
indoors.
The Humming-birds, particularly, are doing beautifully and look
lovely under such conditions.

(I emphasize " for museums " as I never collected one skin for plumage
purposes) I gradually drifted into a collector of live birds, at one time
combining the two. This was at a time when rarities we are now
accustomed to see imported as a matter of course were few and far
between. At first, and for many years, my collections were made
for the owners of large private aviaries. I think what induced me
to take up the life, quite apart from the risks and excitement of it,
was that others here at home could get to know and enjoy as living
creatures some of the rare and beautiful birds hitherto only known
from skins in museums. In this way I have been able to introduce to
aviculture endless species for the first time. I remember as a boy how
I gazed enraptured at exotic birds in museums and natural history
books and longed to see them alive with my own eyes. Since those
days I have seen all these in their own surroundings and even brought
most of them home alive and discovered many others hitherto
unknown to science. There are a few remarkable birds I still hope
to get one day.
I am aware there are people of a certain mentality who consider
it cruel to bring these captives away from their own lands, and I have
many times had it brought to my notice. I recall an amusing incident
of some years back on one of my journeys home with a very valuable
consignment of birds. I was attending to my charges one day when
a solemn-faced missionary suddenly announced his presence with the
exclamation : " Young man, don't you think it is a very cruel thing
you are doing, to make God's beautiful creatures prisoners like this.
Can't I appeal to your better nature to let them go when we get to
land ! " This land would have been the shores of the Eed Sea, so
I leave it for readers to judge where the cruelty would have come in.
No consideration to be taken of the risk and expense I had been put
to, or even the freight paid on them. No, just let those birds from
tropical forests go on the desert shores of the Eed Sea, and according
to our friend I should have done an act of kindness, and his mind no
doubt would have been easy while mine would have been haunted
by the cruel thing I had done.
I could give a number of instances from my own personal experience
where recently caught birds have escaped from cages even in the

jungle and returned again of their own free will. And other cases
where certain birds have been so wild and intractable that for their
own sakes I have turned them loose only for them to return again
and again to captivity. I will give two examples out of many. Both
these occurred up the Maclure Gulf, N.E. New Guinea. Among a
collection I had made was a single Black Lory ( C . ater). It succeeded
in opening its cage door and flew off to join a flock of the same species
which frequented the neighbourhood. This was not near a village
but on a hillside with virgin jungle all around, and the cages were in
a makeshift shed with an open front. One morning four days later
when feeding my birds as usual, a noisy flock of Black Lories flew over-
head, and one detached itself from the others and without any hesitation
flew straight down to its old cage and tried to get in, which of course
I helped it to do. Among the same collection were two birds of no
great interest or beauty, in fact most people consider them ugly, the
Friar Bird or Bare-headed Honey-eaters. There are several species
of this bird, larger and smaller, but all very much alike ; one is well-
known in Queensland under the name of Leatherhead. The two I had
were so wild and went into such paroxysms of fear when fed, or even
approached, I thought it sheer cruelty to keep them confined any
longer. So one day I left the door of their rather small box cage
open. When I returned some time later I was surprised to find them
still in it, so I caught them up and turned them loose. The cage was
left standing under others with the door open, and when I went to
arrange the birds for the night I found the Honey-eaters back in
their cage and just as wild as ever. The next day the same thing
was repeated, and on the third morning when going off on my rounds
I took them a mile or more away and this time said good-bye to them
for ever. It was not cupboard love unless they preferred the food
I supplied to that which grew all around and others of their own
kind to associate with. There is an allied species of this bird now in
an outdoor aviary at the "-Zoo ", presented by Mr. St. Alban Smith.
Often when I see this bird it recalls a terrible murder and suicide
which it witnessed, together with a Lesser Lemon Crested Cockatoo
now in the Parrot House. This was in Singapore, when one evening
a Chinese houseboy killed another Chinaman just under where their

cages were hanging and then blew out his own brains. If only the
inmates of the " Zoo " could speak, what dramatic tales they could
tell perhaps of their capture and long eventful journeys by land and
sea before reaching our shores.
Talking of Leatherheads reminds me of an incident in New Guinea.
I had brought a large collection of birds down to the coast at Port
Moresby, chiefly Birds of Paradise, and among them was a young
raggiana which I had reared by hand from the nest. A very raw youth
from Queensland was looking my birds over one day, and remarked
in his queer drawling voice, " I see you have a young Leatherheadhere."
I told him it was a Bird of Paradise, but he said, "You needn't try
to kid me, I've seen too many Leatherheads not to know one when
I see it." To a superficial observer it might have passed for one.
The face of the Leatherhead is mostly bare of feathers, hence its
name. The entire head of a young raggiana remains bare after the
rest of the body is completely feathered, and the orbital region even
longer, the feathers gradually closing in round the eyes. The same
thing I also observed with a Black Manucode I once reared from
the nest.
I wonder how many readers have kept Cassowaries as pets ; yet I
can vouch for them as being very delightful, at least when young,
and sometimes even when full grown, but individuals even of the same
species vary immensely. I have had many kinds, but one or two
stand out in my memory. One of them was a One Wattled Cassowary
( C. unapyendiculatus ). I got it along the Tanah Merah coast of North
Dutch New Guinea from the natives. It was already quite a large
bird as it began to turn into the adult black plumage almost at once.
I cannot imagine why it was so tame, as no natives in that country
make pets of any birds. In some villages one often sees Cassowaries
of different species running about, old and young, but all have to
fend for themselves more or less and are kept solely with a view to
being eaten one day. At that time I had a Tamil servant who had
been on a pearl lugger named the Shitty Belle , so he promptly
dubbed her " Skitty ", which I afterwards changed to " Kitty ",
and " Kitty " she (or he) always remained. From the first day it
passed to my ownership it showed plainly that it liked to be in close

companionship with me, and remained constantly by my side, gentle
and inoffensive, without that grabbing propensity of trying to swallow
anything laying about which attracts their attention, common to many
of them. It dearly loved to be nursed, and used to get on my knees
as far as such a big bird could. When I was engaged on work at the
table or during meal times it either lay at my feet or with as much
of its body over my knees as it could get, or stood behind my
chair with its head and neck resting over my shoulder. At night it
settled down by the side of my camp bed, and on the island of Sorong,
where mosquito nets were unnecessary, it often during the night
slept with its head under my blanket. Many times it felt about
with its beak in the dark on the outside of the bed to make sure I was
still there. At such times if I rested my hand on it for a little while
it settled down contentedly to sleep again.
Every morning I made a complete tour of the little island to collect
wild fruits for my birds, and on these occasions " Kitty " always
came with me, keeping close by my side. There was one tiny bay of
white coral sand where I always rested for a time under an overhanging
tree while " Kitty " went into the sea for a bath. There were many
other Cassowaries running about in the village, but of these she took
no notice whatever, in fact she carefully avoided them. Many other
charming traits she had which have now escaped my memory.
Just before I had " Kitty " I was living at Humbolt's Bay, not far
from the frontier of what was then German New Guinea. Here I had
many eggs of this species brought to me. The usual colour of course
is green, but some were even cream coloured, and others ranged through
all shades of green, some yellowish ones being especially beautiful.
One day the chief of a large village near by brought in an egg from
which the chick inside could be heard squeeking, therefore I thought
it must be on the point of hatching. As it felt cold I wrapped it in a
flannel cholera belt and put it in my shirt to warm up. It was still
squeaking but not so loudly when I went to bed that night, so I placed
it by my side under the blanket. Here I imagine some will think what
a quiet sleeper I must be. Well I am, I suppose, because during
years of this sort of life one is always adopting all sorts of motherless
creatures, which if very young must be brought to bed for warmth.

They have ranged from kangaroos, monkeys of various kinds, parrots
and other birds, to a jaguar, ocelots, and snakes. The last of course
more often than not in bags.
Waking up during the night, I found the egg very hot--too hot, I
thought--and not a sound from it, and I was afraid I had overcooked
it and laid it by the side of the bed to cool off a bit. In the morning
the egg still remained very warm and silent and I got a bit anxious.
Later I sent for the chiefs and talked it over with them, and the con-
clusion we came to was that all must be well, for if the chick was
dead the egg would have got cold quickly. No doubt it was then
warm and comfortable. The egg remained like this for four days,
during which time I did hear an occasional chirp. I had found it
unnecessary to keep it in my shirt all day ; a warm up now and then
was sufficient, and the rest of the time it was under the blanket, but
at night I kept it in bed with me. On the fourth morning I noticed
a crack in the shell, and a little later the tip of the beak could be seen
working at the opening. It seemed slow work, but by night the crack
had extended considerably, so again it had to go to bed with me. No
doubt at this stage the parent bird would have -helped the young one
to break loose, but I was afraid of damaging it. During the night it
was apparent that something violent was happening, and a sudden
vigorous kick on the part of the chick smashed the shell, and a very
wet and leggy creature was struggling about in the bed. A light was
brought, and my man and I duly admired the new-born babe. After
it had been wrapped in a dry cholera belt and clean sheets put on the
bed, we settled down comfortably until the morning.
After this came an influx of squeaking eggs, and in a similar manner
hatched out no less than seven. Some only took twenty-four hours,
and the longest I kept one was eight days before the chick emerged.
Naturally I was very solicitous for my little family and careful to see
they never lacked food or water, but even for young Cassowaries I
thought their appetites large. Alas, the sequel was sad, for their
bodies developed at such a rate that their legs began to bow out under
the weight and finally were unable to support them. I had made a
large enclosure for them to run in but all to no avail. I had practically
killed them with kindness and overfeeding. They ought to have been

dealt with drastically from birth, and when I started to do so it was
too late. I felt envions as I went through native villages and saw mere
chicks running about with firm legs and all the vigour imaginable, and
yet half-starved and having to compete with the village dogs for any
scraps of offal going. It taught me one lesson, however, and I resolved
that the next young Cassowary I had I would harden my heart in the
matter of feeding.
Perhaps two years later when on my way to the mountains in
British S.E. New Guinea I had my second chance. During a march
one very tiring day I had lingered with a companion a good deal in
the rear of the carriers watching various birds in the trees, when
suddenly far ahead we heard such a sudden hubbub and yells I naturally
thought some revolt had broken out or our men were being attacked.
I had been warned that there was much unrest among a certain tribe
we had to pass through. By the time we caught them up much of
the excitement was over, and through the coloured interpreter I learned
that the first carriers had disturbed a mother Cassowary with four or
five young ones. Although in thick jungle we were by the banks of
a river, and the birds had taken to the water at once in an endeavour
to swim across, for Cassowaries are perfectly good swimmers. All
had succeeded except one, which the current had carried into a small
bend where the bank was too steep for it to land, so the men had
captured it and gone on ahead with it. When we camped that evening
in a deserted forest village I enquired for the bird and found the poor
thing which was not more than a foot high, hanging by it legs from a
projection in one of the huts. They were intending to kill and cook
it as soon as they had started a fire, so I only arrived just in time to
save it. From then on I took entire charge of it. We had still some
six or seven days' travelling to do, from early morning till night with
only a short halt at midday, so it was not a good beginning for such a
young bird and not giving it much of a chance. We were bound for high
ranges where dwelt the Long-tailed Birds of Paradise, the Princess
Stephanie's, and Meyer's Sickle-bill, and the only way it could travel
was tied up in a bag on the top of one of the loads. It was fed and
watered three times a day under great difficulties, as at first I was
always afraid it would run off into the forests. Eventually we settled

in camp in a cold damp region nearly always in clouds, somewhere
near 8,000 feet, the trees all heavily festooned with funereal-looking
moss. One of the first things I did was to have a daytime enclosure
made for the Cassowary. At night it was to be put away snugly in a
box in my tent ; but we might have saved ourselves all this trouble,
for it had by now no intention whatever of losing sight of us, and
settled down to domestic life in camp thoroughly at home and con-
tented.
In Port Moresby I had met a young Danish count globe-trotting
and anxious to see something of the interior of the country. For the
sake of his company I was only too glad to take him along with me
when he suggested it. He was a keen naturalist and just as fond of
birds as myself, so between us I am afraid the " baby " was inclined
to be spoilt. It was not long before it learnt that the warmest place
in camp as evening came on was under our blankets, and soon found
a way to get on the beds and insinuate itself under the blankets where it
remained until fastened up in its own box for the night. It grew
rapidly, and at each change of camp its transport became a question
for consideration. It also began to be blamed for any trifle lost or
mislaid in camp owing to a habit it had of swallowing anything it
could get down its throat, and it was surprising what it could get down.
Several times I just managed to save my bunch of keys by holding its
neck tightly and putting my fingers down its throat. When natives
came into camp, as they did daily when we returned to lower altitudes,
Kitty the Second, as I had by now named her, wandered innocently
among them as they squatted about on the ground, but with a keen
eye on their necklaces. A sudden grab with her beak and before they
realized what had happened Kitty was hastily picking up the beads
and swallowed half before they knew where they were. The natives
soon got used to this, and it was amusing to see them take off their
finery before settling down. She seemed to me to know that she
belonged to a superior race of people, to assume a disdainful manner
with the natives, walking among them in a condescending way;
neither did she hesitate to show fight with their dogs. One day on
the coast when looking through a bag of money I came upon an
Australian sovereign, which I placed at my side on the bed. In a

moment Kitty had spotted that bright golden coin and had swallowed
it before I could stop her. In this case, the only thing to do was to
shut her up in an empty room until it was recovered.
In due course after many adventures Kitty arrived home and
went straight to Hoddam Castle, Dumfries. Here at once she
established herself a prime favourite for several years. She had
palatial quarters, but during the day was allowed the freedom of a
considerable part of the grounds. I am sorry to relate though, as
she increased in size and strength she began to make herself objection-
able to the gardeners. It was no doubt all done in play, but several
times she ripped up (or rather down) their trousers, and more or less
severely scratched them ; so she had to be confined to her quarters
which made her temper altogether worse, but with her owner she was
always affection itself.
One day before this time she was found missing, and telephone
messages were sent to the police stations around. It was not long
before reports began to come in from districts she had passed through,
but all seemed afraid to capture her. On the second day she was
reported to be 18 miles away and then lost sight of again. On
the third day, a tired dust-covered Kitty was seen approaching the
castle, almost too tired to go any farther, but when she saw her owner
she put on a spurt and sank down at his feet evidently very glad to be
home again. This speaks volumes for her intelligence that she was
able to find her way back again. Shortly after this her career ended
at Hoddam, and she was presented to Kegent's Park where she lived
until she caught a cold and died.
It was a Painted-necked Cassowary ( C . &apos;picticollis) , one of the
smaller mountain species, rare as a living bird in captivity.
Once in another part of New Guinea I came suddenly upon a very
large full-grown bird (C. sclateri) idly pecking about in the pebbly
bed of a wide dried-up river. It was well out in the middle when it
saw me, and the tactics it adopted were somewhat curious. Instead
of at once making a dash for the tree-lined banks, it pretended to be
quite unconcerned and went on pecking about, but gradually making
for the shelter of some rocks. As soon as it reached them it took to
its heels and was gone like a flash. In the brilliant sunlight it looked

strangely beautiful, and somehow almost prehistoric in the silent
surroundings where not a bird's note was to be heard.
On reading this paper through, I fear I have not presented
Cassowaries as favourably as I intended or they deserve. However,
I have written chiefly of two only out of many individuals and species
which have been under my care for longer or shorter periods. I can
thoroughly recommend them to those who are able to give the necessary
accommodation to such large birds, although under these conditions
they can never to so interesting as say in a camp wandering about
free. They are not difficult to keep if they have a little warmth in the
winter, nor are they expensive to feed, but they cannot stand damp
cold. So fond am I of these birds that at one time I seriously
considered settling in some Eastern island where I could keep and
breed them.

This beautiful Bee-eater, which figured in the January number
of the Avicultural Magazine of 1927, was brought over by Mr. Webb,
the well-known collector, in June, 1926. In all five specimens were
landed in perfect condition. Two of these went to Captain Stokes
and the remaining three were secured by me. I need not describe
the bird as the coloured drawing by Boland Green in the January
number of the Magazine of 1927 shows him off perfectly. I do not
think this species has ever been imported before, and great credit is
due to Mr. Webb for landing these delicate birds in such wonderful
condition. When I first saw them at Gamage's shop, I must admit,
I was frightened of them as I did not think they would do in captivity,
so did not buy them. I soon changed my mind when I saw the two

flying about in Captain Stokes' aviary. I rang up Gamage's at once and
secured the remaining three birds. These were turned out in one of my
small aviaries, and it was a treat to see them chase flies and eat them.
They lived practically on mealworms and, of course, caught every
bee and wasp that flew into the aviary and swallowed it. Practically
the whole of their first winter they ate only mealworms and these
had to be thrown up to them, as they never came to the food tray.
They were marvellous at catching mealworms, and no matter how
difficult the catch, it was never missed. They were fed in this way all
the winter months, and kept in the heated part of the aviary. They
were given six good feeds of mealworms a day, and on the tray with
the insectivorous food a few mealworms were always left. For the
whole winter the birds were not seen on the food tray, so the other
occupants of the aviary must have made short work of the mealworms.
So the whole of their first winter these birds lived only on mealworms.
In the spring they were in robust health, and gradually took to visiting
the food tray, when they did not only eat the mealworms but helped
themselves to some of the insectivorous mixture. All the summer
months a piece of meat was left hanging in the outer flight of the aviary
to attract flies and blue-bottles, and these were quickly devoured by the
Bee-eaters. I lost one of the three birds after about eighteen months,
and the second one lived for four years, when he died of pneumonia.
The third and last one lived in perfect health and plumage till last
March, when he was killed by some other bird in the aviary. All the
birds in the aviary were old ones, and they had lived amicably for
years--I .don't know till this day who killed this delightful pet. The
other occupants of the aviary were a pair of Fairy Bluebirds, a pair
of Amethyst Starlings, a pair of Rufous-bellied Niltavas, and a pair
of White-cheeked Bulbuls. I rather suspect the Bulbuls, although
they always seemed friendly enough. I have never regretted the loss
of a bird more and I am sure a Bee-eater has never been kept in captivity
for so long. From June, 1926 to March, 1933--nearly seven years.
Needless to say they were great favourites of mine and no birds
gave me greater pleasure. Bee-eaters do splendidly in large aviaries,
and look lovely when flying about after insects. They are quite easy
to keep provided they are given a lot of mealworms and a warm shelter

is absolutely essential for the winter months. Even in winter my birds
used to fly out into the outside flight, but. only for exercise, and they
did not stay out long. They were the most intelligent birds I have
ever kept, and always seemed to know what was good for them. No
birds will ever take their place with me.
Since writing the above, Mr. Webb has just brought me two Bee-
eaters of the same species from East Africa. They are in splendid
condition, and live on mealworms alone at present. As soon as they
are turned out in the outdoor aviary they will take to catching flies
and other insects. I have turned them out in a small aviary inside
my bird room, and in two days they have already got used to taking
mealworms on the wing. Up to now they took them from a feeding
tin placed near the perch in their cage. They never seem to drink.
I hope they will do as well as the last lot, and needless to say I am
delighted to have some of these delightful birds again.
THE PRESIDENT'S PARTY, 1933
By Captain H. S. Stokes
On Saturday, 27th May, some eighty members visited Foxwarren to
see again all the birds and beasts, and to enjoy once more the kindly
hospitality of our president and Mrs. Ezra.
Unfortunately, for the second year in succession the rain teemed
down unceasingly, and therefore the birds could not be examined so
closely as many of us would have liked, but nevertheless it was a most
pleasant party and reunion.
Although the birds at Foxwarren are always beautifully kept
and in glorious condition, yet much extra work had been done in pre-
paration for the party by Jones and Shearing, Mr. Ezra's two head
bird men, and it was disappointing for them not to be able to display
the fruits of their labour under sunny conditions.
As I was staying with Mr. Ezra for the week-end I may perhaps
emphasize one or two of the main features of the aviaries this year.

Among new arrivals were a Humming Bird from the same con-
signment as those displayed at the London Zoo and four species of
Sunbirds and some Bee-eaters brought by Mr. Webb from East Africa.
Breeding in the aviaries were Crowned Starlings, the hen flying at
liberty to feed her young, also Buppel's Starlings, Derbyan, Queen
Alexandra, and Malabar Parrakeets.
There were numerous families of Alexandrine Parrakeets in the
nest-boxes, but unfortunately the eggs from the Blue cock and his
Blue-bred daughter were unfertile, and the young from the Lutino
pair of the same species were not reared.
In the enclosure for animals and large birds a very remarkable
feature was the nesting of two pairs of the rare Reynolds' Ground
Cuckoos (&amp;lt;Carpococcyx renauldi) from Indo-China.
These birds have been in the aviaries for two or three years, but
last winter Mr. Ezra turned them out without even clipping their
wings. They did not stray away, and both females are now incubating
clutches of eggs in nests built a fair height from the ground. It is
greatly to be hoped that complete success will be achieved with their
breeding. On the smaller duck pond we were able to see a young
White-backed Duck from Madagascar (Thalassornis leuconota ) three-
quarters grown and quite independent of his parents. This is the first
breeding of the species in England, and indeed no one else has
succeeded in keeping it for long. The very rare Pink-headed Duck
from India was greatly admired, but unfortunately the chances of
breeding it have vanished for the present, as the only female died
during the winter. Many old friends among the birds which we have
been accustomed to see at Foxwarren were still there, and in their
usual faultless condition. Flocks of Cranes of three or four species,
Pheasants, Flamingoes, Geese, and Pea Fowl, all looked quite lovely
in their surroundings of lawn and woodland.
Mr. Leach proposed a vote of thanks to our hosts who were
heartily acclaimed.
Altogether it was a delightful party, so please Mr. President let us
come again next year.

Mr. C. S. Webb returned borne on 25th May from a successful
collecting expedition in the region of the Aberdare Mountains, north
of Naivasha, Kenya. As might have been expected from a district
where the collection of live birds has rarely if ever before been
attempted, almost everything brought home was new to aviculture. All
arrived in good condition, the majority being perfect, as is usual with
Mr. Webb's birds, so carefully does he study their caging and attention
from the day of capture. The natives, Mr. Webb tells me, take no
interest in the birds and have no idea as to how to capture them, so
that Mr. Webb had to do his catching himself.

There is the problem of keeping the grass in aviaries short. This
can be done, if the flight is a big one, with a lawn mower, or with
clippers in a small one. The last method is slow and one is likely to
have blisters when it is all clipped. The former is frightening
to the birds, especially if they have nests in the flights.
During the last two years I have employed guinea-pigs, to whom
it is all in the day's work. It is extraordinary how soon and efficiently
they get over the ground. They are much more suitable than rabbits
would be as they do not burrow, and are more easily prevented from
destroying the plants and bushes which are growing in the aviary.
This is done with strips of netting round the base of the plants. The
animals can be moved from one division to another in their box without
disturbing the birds. There are those who will not wish to run the risk
of souring the ground with them ; I have found no ill-effect up to the
present.
In Woolworth's one can buy vases made of sheet-iron (Fig. 1)
painted dark green, conical in shape; apex down with a large nail to
push into the ground--they are designed, I think, to keep cut flowers
fresh on graves. These will be found to be just the thing in which to

place seeding grasses. They will keep the grass from withering and their
shape spreads the grasses so that the birds can reach every head of
seed. Do not forget to plug the centre with a wisp of grass to keep the
birds from being drowned.
A root of Polygonum Sachalinense is well worth having in an aviary.
It grows to about six or seven feet high and its large leaves give a
tropical effect, also good cover for the birds from strong sun and rain.
It dies down in the winter and shoots up again each spring.
It is useless, of course, in aviaries in which there are birds which
eat every green leaf they come upon.
Those who are contemplating the building of a new aviary should
consider this method. Build each side and the roof in sections. When
the inside of a section has been sheeted with tongue and groove sheeting,
turn it over and fill the whole up to the level of the framing with saw-
dust which has been well sprinkled with creosote ; then the outside
sheeting may be nailed in place. When all the sections are completed
and a foundation has been prepared, the house may be erected, care
having been taken, when designing, for bolts and holes for final
fastening. Half-inch sheeting will be required for the outside and even
thinner will do for the inside. If you do this you will have a house on
the lines of a hay-box cooker in which the temperature can be kept
very even. It also has the advantage of being very cheap to build.
Double glass with a space of 1 inch between panes will be well worth

the extra cost. Mice and parasites will not have anything to do with
the creosoted sawdust.
If you are troubled with mice, a cheap and efficient stand for seed
hoppers may be made by using 4 or 6 in. crockery pipes (Fig. 2)
These pipes have one end enlarged to fit over the small end of another
pipe. This serves as a base on which it can stand. A wood tray to carry
the hoppers and catch the husks may be arranged to rest on the top.
A convenient method of fixing this is to procure a round tin can which
just fits inside the pipe. This is then screwed to the bottom of the tray,
and will be found quite steady when in position inside the pipe. It
also has the advantage of being easily removed.
If one is in the habit of electrically lighting their aviary on winter
nights, there is the difficulty of getting all the birds on to their perches
before the light is turned out. One is kept standing hand on switch ;
just as all is ready one bird hops on to the wire division or some such
foolish place. It is no sooner on a perch when another does likewise--
it is a little wearing on one's patience. This can be avoided if you have
two lampholders and switches, in one holder is an ordinary lamp and
in the other a Neon lamp. These lamps give a red glow sufficient for
the birds to find their way to their roosting places, and they may be
left on all night as they consume so very little current.
A FEW BREEDING NOTES FROM FOXWARREN
UP TO ioth MAY* 1933
By A. P. Shearing
As this is my first venture at penning a few notes for the magazine
perhaps a short account of the breeding results to date may be of
interest to members.
Chinese Blackbird ( Turdus mandarinus). --This pair of birds have
been given an aviary to themselves and are at present incubating
four eggs.
Crowned Starling ( Galeopsar salvadorii). --There are two pairs
of these this 'year and the old pair have already built and laid the

first egg, and I hope by the time these notes are in print to have some
young ones as it is a picture to see the hen bird at liberty. A second
pair are busily engaged in building.
Rothschild's Grakle ( Leucopsar rothschildi) .--To date only one
egg has been laid and this was eaten. It seems as though the only
way of successfully breeding these birds is to remove the eggs as soon
as they are laid and place them in Starlings' or Thrushes' nests.
Wong a Wonga Pigeon ( Leucosarcia jpicata) .--These birds have
started the same habits of last year as the first two eggs were both
fertile, but the birds only sat 10 days ; they are at present incubating
two eggs, but these will shortly be placed under Domestic Pigeons.
Slenderbill Starling ( Cinnamopterus tenuirostris). --We are
hoping for better luck this year with these birds as they have almost
finished building operations, and to prevent any expected young ones
from falling out of the nest a large cradle has been placed under this.
It is very interesting to see how these birds shaped their nest and the
large amount of mud, dried grass and feathers that are used.
Shama ( Kittocincla malabarica). --Both pairs have obliged by laying
eggs and we are hoping they will be more businesslike this year
than last.
American Bluebird (Sialia sialis). --Started building the day
they were given a nest-box and the first egg was laid 2nd April, two
eggs being laid in all ; but owing to the very cold weather these did
not hatch, although both contained perfectly formed chicks. Four
more eggs were laid by 2nd May and these are now being incubated.
White-Winged Mynah (Sturnia nemoricolor) .--The pair that
successfully reared a young one last year are now incubating four eggs.
Madagascar Partridge ( Margaroperdix madagascariensis) .--A
pair of these have laid seven eggs up to the present, ten eggs being
the usual number laid.
African Wattled Plover ( Lobivanellus lateralis). --This pair
again chose the pathway in the large aviary for their nesting site
and bits of bark were used to construct the nest. On 24th April
the first egg was laid ; two days later another egg was found broken
in the pond. The birds did not seem to take much notice of the first
egg and yesterday (6th May) another egg was found about 4 yards

from where the first was laid. Evidently they had taken a dislike
to the first nest as they were observed trying to roll the egg along the
pathway to the second nest.
Pied Grallina ( Grallina picata ).--Built a cup-shaped nest on a
beam in sleeping place, using a considerable quantity of mud, and first
egg laid 27th April. Up to the present these birds are incubating
very well.
Superb Starling ( Spreo superbus). --One young was hatched out
on 27th April. Another pair are incubating three eggs.

The old pair laid five eggs by the 12th April and three young were
hatched out by the 25th, the other two being infertile. One young
one was found dead three days later, the other two are now twelve
days old. The cock bird was removed from the aviary after the
hen had been sitting a few days, so apparently this plan is proving
very successful. A pair that were reared here in 1931 laid six eggs
by the 25th April and two young were hatched out to-day (7th May).
We are now waiting to see how these birds behave.
Ring-necked Parrakeet ( Psittacala krameii ).--A lutino hen,
mated to a green male, laid four eggs by the 27th March. One young
was hatched out on 21st April the other three eggs being infertile.
Another pair of Ring-necked Parrakeets, lutino hen and green
male, laid three eggs by the 2nd April and two young were hatched
out on 30th April. As this hen is extremely spiteful and very fond of
human flesh I have not ascertained whether the third is good.
A third pair of Ring-necked Parrakeets, both lutinos, laid four
eggs by 31st March. All contained dead chicks so it is quite obvious
that there is some weakness in these as each time the same thing has
occurred.
A hen Ring-necked Parrakeet, mated to a cock Alexandrine X Ring-
necked hybrid, laid five eggs by 28th March and three young was
hatched out by 21st April; the other two eggs contained dead chicks.
A pair of Alexandrine Parrakeets (Psittacula nipalensis) laid
four eggs by 5th February and three young were hatched out, two
by the 6th March and the third six days later. One of the young
ones was found dead on the 17th March and the other two were found

to have been brutally murdered the next day, apparently the work
of the parent birds as nothing can get into the aviary. This is rather
unusual for these birds as in other years they have both proved them-
selves to be beyond reproach with regard to rearing young.
These birds have just hatched out three more young. I wonder
if the same fate is in store for these.
Another pair, both lutinos, went to nest and three eggs were laid
by the 27th January, all being infertile. They again went to nest and
three more eggs were laid by the 24th March. One young was
hatched out but was found buried under some peat moss ; the other
two eggs were infertile.

these birds have decided to do something more than destroying aviaries,
so after gnawing the roof off one nest-box and examining the other
nest-box in the flight they decided to rent the nest-box in the sleeping
quarters and on 23rd April the first egg was laid. Two days later I
went to see if any more eggs were laid, but got no farther than the
door of the sleeping quarters as the hen bird gave one shriek and flew
at me in such-a manner as to indicate that the safest place was out-
side the aviary. Some days later, however, I did manage to get a
peep into the nest, and discovered two eggs ; since then I have given
her a wide berth.
White-crested Jay ( Garrulax diardi ).---These birds made a nice
nest this year and one egg was laid by the 12th April; this was hatched
out on 26th April and found dead the next day. These birds make a
habit of throwing their young out of the nest.
Bronze-winged Pigeon ( Phajps chalco&apos;ptera). --The old pair of
these have started well this year as they already have one young which
is now 14 days old. Another pair are incubating two eggs.

REVIEWS
THE MEANING OF ANIMAL COLOUR AND ADORNMENT
(Edward Arnold &amp; Co., 18s. net.)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.98401995" page_id="56237503"  page_num="201" year="" vol="">
Major R. W. G. Kingston, the author of this book, is a well-known
and observant field naturalist who has done much excellent work
amongst which may be mentioned the production of books of great
merit, such as A Naturalist in the Guiana Forest. In the volume now
under notice he tries to prove that the chief function of the various
colour adornments of animals is to excite fear in rivals and so give
the animal possessing these special markings or adornments an
advantage over its adversaries. Since, however, an animal generally
fights with a rival of its own species and sex, which is similarly adorned,
it is difficult to see what advantage the one has over the other. The
author admits that many animals are protectively coloured, but con-
siders that they would be better equipped in this direction if they
were entirely without markings, or self-coloured and devoid of the
dark or light markings which nearly all possess. He instances the
lion as a tawny-coloured animal which would be more protectively
coloured than it is if it did not possess the darker markings which
are found on the mane, tail-tuft, and ears. Such markings he con-
siders as threatening marks. He does not seem to have grasped the
fact that an animal that is uniformly coloured and devoid of all
markings is very much more conspicuous than one in which the shape

of the animal is broken up by distinct markings such as are found on
these areas of the lion. The dark line which runs diagonally across
the body of the great ant-eater may look conspicuous enough in a
cage, but amongst the lights and shades of its native forest must
entirely obliterate its outline.
The brilliant and extravagant markings on many male birds,
Major Hingston believes, are there for the purpose of striking terror
in their rivals, but since, in many cases, these markings are only
visible when making advances to the female it seems evident that they
are there for the sole purpose of inducing her to turn her attentions
to family matters. An Argus Pheasant, for instance, will exhibit
his wonderfully marked wing-feathers to his mate alone, and if a
rival male appears these are at once hidden and a rush is made, with
no sort of display, and the rival driven oh.
When enumerating the " threatening colours " of birds Major
Hingston mentions the red legs of the male Red-crested Pochard,
a bird which would certainly meet a rival on the water, where nothing
but a fish is likely to see these brilliant appendages!
The author is correct when he says that the songs of birds have
the effect of warning rivals that the territory is occupied, but this is
not their only function. In the case of migrants the male arrives
first and, having occupied a site for his summer home, his song has
the effect of attracting the first female of his species that comes within
earshot. And why should not song be a sign of contentment and joy ?
Major Hingston's book is well worthy of careful perusal by all
who would try to solve the great problems of Nature, but we feel sure
that many of our readers will fail to agree with some at least of the
theories he advances.

THE SPLENDID GRASS PARRAKEET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990488529411765" page_id="56237505"  page_num="203" year="" vol="">
I have been fortunate, through the great kindness of Mr. Harvey, of Adelaide,
to secure a very fine pair of Splendid Grass Parrakeets bred by himself and
nearly adult. The cock will be a magnificent specimen should he survive
his next complete moult, as the greater part of his breast is already scarlet.
The hen is extremely Turquoisine-like, so much so that I doubt if I should
have identified her as a different species had she come over with Turquoisines.
The blue on her wing is certainly paler but less strikingly so than I expected,
and she has a good shot of orange on the abdomen, but so have some hen
Turquoisines. It is evident that N. splendida is the Turquoisine's closest
ally, far closer than any of the Grass Parrakeets of the Bluewing type which
cannot be so very near as their hybrids with the Turquoisine appear to be
sterile.
The Splendid's favourite food appears to be spray millet and they are
very fond of seeding grass and green food.
Like many aviary-bred Parrakeets they are at present more timid than
the average bird that has been captured in a wild state.

SUNBIRDS

I was delighted to see in the June number of the Magazine an article
on Sunbirds from the able pen of the Hon. Anthony Chaplin. I notice that
Mr. Chaplin does not agree with all I wrote about Sunbirds in the May issue.
This is all to the good, as one learns much from such discussions. May I be
allowed, however, to make a few further remarks on this interesting subject ?
In my recent article I did not say that Sunbirds required great heat. I said
that I had found that they could stand the cold when once acclimatized, but
did better with a little heat, and I still maintain that this is so. If a bird can
live in the cold when at liberty it does not follow that it will continue to
do so when in captivity. This I have proved over and over again. Take, for
example, our own British birds, the Wren and Tree-creeper. I have always
found that they will be far happier when caged if given a little heat, and
60 degrees is far better than 40 degrees. Now as regards my advice about food,
I have found that if the syrup is given too strong it is likely to purge the bird,

also I have had deaths from over-fatness which sometimes results in fits.
Because a bird lives for, say, 6 or even 12 months and appears to be in perfect
health and then dies, it does not, in my opinion, mean that you have fed and
treated it correctly. On the treatment I advised, I kept in full health a Purple
Sunbird for 10^ years ; also my well-known winning Malachite lived for close
upon 9 years. I could point to many more nectar-feeding birds, apart from
Sunbirds, that have done well on this weak syrup, but will only mention two.
Yellow-wing Sugar Bird, 10 years ; Swainson's Lorikeet, 9 years, and still
going strong. With such results as these I cannot for one moment think my
treatment could have been wrong. In closing may I throw out a suggestion
about Tanagers ( Calliste ) mentioned by Mr. Chaplin ? Treat these as advised
for Sunbirds and half our troubles will be over, and they will live much longer.

" YADIL " FOR ROUPE AND GAPES
About a month ago a friend brought me a young Gouldian to see
what I could do with it, as it was blind in one eye. Two days later it developed
a thick cheesy matter around the nostrils, and had the offensive smell of
roupe. Anyway, I strictly isolated it and treated with " Yadil ". It is now
practically fit and well again, and my friend writes to say he has lost, I think
he said, three other Gouldians from the same trouble and the p.m. report is
roupe, as I surmised at first. I have never come across roupe before in Finches,
although I have treated dozens of cases in poultry. By the way, there was some
correspondence in the Magazine about gapes and worms in Spico Starlings,
etc. The best preventative and cure for gapes and worms I ever used was
raw garlic smashed up and put in the drinking water. At least this is what
I regularly used for my Bantams, Poultry, and Pheasants in Natal. This
is one reason why I favour the use of " Yadil ", as I understand garlic is
one of its chief ingredients.

MY TROPICAL AVIARY

By G. H. Gurney
A short account of my recently-constructed tropical aviary may
be of interest to other members and induce them to start something
of the same sort. A very small outlay, not necessarily using very
great heat, will furnish an old greenhouse or disused conservatory,
and with a little ingenuity a delightful and uncommon aviary may
be made. My house, a photograph of one corner of which accompanies
this article, was constructed out of a small greenhouse, which had
formerly housed a dull array of ordinary pot plants. Extra hot-water
pipes were added, and tall tropical plants planted. It is some 24 feet
long by 15 feet wide : to this I added a long extension of brick and
glass, built at right angles to the main house. The glass sides I painted
with a rough representation of a tropical forest, with dense foliage and
trees ; this blocks out the adjacent aviaries and houses, which could
be seen through the glass and spoilt the effect. The illusion is further
increased by the tall-growing tropical plants, planted on three sides
of the house, palms, dracaenas, and a banana tree, seven or eight feet
high, while the roof is covered with exotic creepers and the curious
pitcher plants ( Nepentes ); this gives additional shade for the birds. Two
rather large tree trunks covered with moss and lichen, on which are
planted some scarlet Nidulariums, help to give a further tropical effect.

G. H. Gurney--My Tropical Aviary
Light branches are placed here and there as perches for the birds, so
disposed that their droppings will not soil the plants beneath. All the
plants are growing ; none are in pots. Two pools overhung by ferns
etc. contain respectively some tropical fish, and two small aligators and
six little water terrapins. The fourth side of the house is planted with
a collection of smaller stove plants, backed by crotons, anthuriums
with their huge leaves, and caladiums. One side of the L-shaped
extension is occupied by a long tank which contains a number of large
tropical aquatic plants ; the opposite side being given up to aquaria
for tropical fish. At the extreme end of the extension is a small aviary,
divided into three compartments, containing Sunbirds ; all the other
birds are flying loose. The temperature is never allowed to drop below
70*, and is often nearly up to 90*. The whole house is thoroughly
sprayed three times a day, consequently the atmosphere is always
moist and damp. Under these conditions both birds and plants flourish
amazingly, and all look perfect.
The birds at present flying loose include five or six Minivets (which
are almost over- tame, and refuse to stop perching on one's head or
arms, if they think there is any chance of a mealworm), a King Bird
of Paradise, several Yellow-winged Sugar Birds, a Blacked-headed
Sugar Bird, a Purple Sugar Bird, a Green Fruitsucker, a Redstart,
a lovely White-starred Bush-robin (Gogonocilla stellata), a Kuhls
Ground Thrush (perfectly tame, and always singing beautifully;
very smart too in his black-and-white plumage and rich chestnut-
coloured head), and a Dusky Sunbird ( Crisnyris mediocris), which
stands no nonsense from any of the other birds ; he is a beautiful
and constant songster, too. Pittas did extremely well in the house
but, as they kept entirely hidden among the thick foliage and were
never seen, though often heard, I removed them. I could put other
birds in, but I prefer rather to understock it, than overcrowd it.
A seat at one end of the house adds considerably to one's pleasure
when watching the birds.
Not far from the tropical house I have recently constructed another
rather unusual kind of aviary, in the shape of an old disused squash-
racquet court. A glass roof has been added and, as it measures roughly
23 feet square and is over 25 feet high, it is thoroughly spacious.

F. R, S. Balfour--Capercaillie in Upper Tweeddale 207
This is furnished with tall oleander trees and various palms in tubs.
At present there is no artificial heating, but I hope to have hot-water
pipes, connecting with an already-existing outside stove, installed
during the summer. Natural boughs for perches stretch across the
entire width of the house. Here I have a pair of Maroon Orioles,
a Lesser Bird of Paradise, a Lort's Roller, Festive Tanagers and
some Royal and Spreo Starlings. One corner has been wired in, as a
separate aviary, and this contains a pair of White-headed Wood
Hoopoes, very showy and amusing birds, which delight in running
up and down the sloping trunk of a tree covered with cork bark,
in a very woodpecker-like way; two handreared Ringed Plovers
run about on the peat moss at the bottom of the aviary, and are
charmingly tame and confiding. Some cages contain Lories, Conures,
and Barbets. Here again a long seat placed against the back wall
adds considerably to one's comfort when watching the inmates of my
racquet-court aviary.

CAPERCAILLIE IN UPPER TWEEDDALE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985706" page_id="56237517"  page_num="207" year="" vol="">
By F. R. S. Balfour
Perhaps it might be of some interest to the members of the
Avicultural Society to hear of my successful introduction of Capercaillie
(.Tetrao urogallus) to the woods of Dawyck in Upper Tweeddale.
In 1929 and 1930 I received eggs from Perthshire and one
consignment of day-old chicks. I had no success whatever. The chicks
from the few eggs that hatched died in a short time, as did the live
chicks that were sent to me.
I then set about getting three-quarter grown birds. My efforts
in Scotland were not encouraging ; only one cock and one hen reaching
me from Deeside in August, 1930. In September of that year I was
fishing in Southern Norway and made arrangements for the catching
up of Capercaillie in nets. However, although two hen birds were

208 F. R. S. Balfour\0x25A0--Caper collie in Upper Tweeddale
caught, they were not sent to me owing, I believe, to difficulty in
getting permission for the export of game birds from Norway.
My next attempt was to get them from Finland. Of two cock
and four hen cc Auerwild 35 shipped to me from Helsingfors to Hull in
November, 1930, all arrived safely except one of the cocks, which died
on the voyage. Of the four hens, one died a few days after they had
been turned into our woods in the last week of the month. The
Capercaillie were seen from time to time in my woods and those of
my neighbours, but I did not hear of any nesting in the season
of 1931.
In October of that year two more cocks and one hen reached me
safely from Finland.
In June, 1932, at an altitude of about 1,300 feet in a larch wood
of about ninety years old, I saw a nest of seven eggs and flushed
both the old birds. By laying rags soaked in renardine here and
there in a circle a hundred yards from the nest we assured its safety
from foxes. All the eggs hatched. I heard of another nest in the wood
of Glentress, some twelve miles down the valley, and we believe that
another brood was reared at Dawyck in the same larch wood as that
in which the first nest was found, but over a mile distant.
This year a nest was found on the 2nd June, with five eggs, at
about the same altitude as the nest of last year. We protected it in
the same manner and I have since learned that all the eggs hatched.
It is well known that the native Capercaillie became extinct about
the year 1770, the last mention of it being that of Pennant, who said
it could still be met with in Glenmoriston in Inverness-shire in 1769.
It was reintroduced at Taymouth in Perthshire in 1837 and 1838.
Since then it has steadily progressed through the glens of the Highlands
wherever the planting of coniferous woods has provided it with food.
The interest of my experiment is that, as far as I know, the species
does not occur elsewhere south of Clyde and Forth, though an attempt
to establish it was made in 1841 at Glenapp in Ayrshire and occasionally
since then, though I believe without success.

By the Hon. Anthony Chaplin
After a vigil of eight years I have at length become the possessor
of three living Humming-Birds : they have been with me now for
a month. It is an unfortunate truth that a dream at long last fulfilled
too often savours of disappointment. But in this case I am happy not
to have proved this serious state of things, for, although I have followed
the tortuous path of trocilidic study for a reasonable season, I am still
able to find with Hudson that ' Humming-Birds are perhaps the very
loveliest things in nature But, unlike and in spite of that great
man of letters and of science, having " sufficiently admired the unique
beauty and marvellous velocity of Humming-Birds ", I consider there
is still a deal more to be said about them. Indeed, one of the greatest
attractions of this race of " feathered fairies ", which certainly
" promises to exceed all other families--even the cosmopolitan Finches
and Warblers--in number of species ", is that we know so little about
them when it comes to being more than just a " science of dead
animals ".
One of the few facts concerning Humming-Birds about which
aviculturists feel any confidence is that they become lifeless at a lower
temperature than 65* F. Nevertheless, I have had Eupetomena macroura
in an outdoor aviary for a fortnight, and it is in fine health : the
appended chart of temperatures is inclined to lower the value of such
facts. Likewise, I have submitted the little Chrysolampis moschitus
and Eucephela ccendea to the comparatively low temperature of 57* F.
for considerable periods at a stretch, without seeing any change in the
apparently excellent condition of these diminutive beings. Even so,
I have found the Chrysolampis torpid at 70* at 10.30 p.m., so we must
seek the real explanation of this unusual avian habit elsewhere.
What do we know of the feeding habits of the Trochilidse ? Of
migration, of voice, of mental disposition ? " Oh, yes," you say,
" they do not sing, for they have no vocal muscles ; they resemble
insects rather than birds in intelligence ; we know, for we have read."
Yet not a few species certainly boast of vocal powers in keeping with
their pigmy persons, and in captivity they show more intelligence

than that over-musical Canary-bird which has had the benefit of
man's instruction for countless generations.
How generally known is it that Humming-Birds are found in Canada
during the warmer months ? Not one species, nor even two, but no
less than four. Even the tiny Stellula calliope breeds in the Rockies of
British Columbia round about latitude 60* N., a fact only recently
made known. Yet most of us expressed incredulity on being told that
merely one species travels up the west coast and another up the east in
summer, as far as Alaska and Nova Scotia respectively. Who knows
whether more do not breed in the mountains of the North-west Pacific
Coast ? And at the other end of the continent what of those seen by
Captain King flying in a snowstorm round the fuscias of Tierra del
Fuego ? Despite all this, they will always be considered by most of
us as a tropical family.
Now many years have passed since Hudson's death, and there
remains much to be learnt of the mysteries of the Trochilidse ; nay,
I have no doubt they will keep us in speculative excitement for many
and many years to come.
Although the little creatures may be suspected of being hardier
than many of us would credit, it is earnestly to be hoped that they
will not be kept in captivity by those who are unwilling or unable
to spend a great deal of time with them. If they can stand some cold,
there still remain a hundred and one causes for sudden decline. And,
above all, the keeper of Humming-Birds should be one who has
cultivated a real understanding of the conditions governing the wild
state of the family as a whole.

The article in the May issue of the Avicultural Magazine on
Bourke's Parrakeets by Mr. Boosey was of particular interest to me,
as in many respects his experience in breeding these birds is different
from my own, and therefore it may interest some of our members to
hear my experience.

The well-known authority on foreign birds, Captain Eattigan, came
into possession of a pair of young Bourke's freshly imported, but owing
to ill-health Captain Eattigan had to give up all his birds for a time
and place himself in the hands of a London specialist. He offered the
young Bourke's to an eminent aviculturist, who, however, refused the
offer, claiming the hen had a broken wing. Captain Eattigan maintained
that it was a strain and not a fracture and that the bird would be
flying again in a short while. However, his offer was refused on the
ground that the hen would be very unlikely to breed successfully.
Captain Eattigan then suggested that I should take the birds, as
my aviary is a large one. As I had never possessed any Parrakeets
and had only a knowledge of Budgerigars, I was rather afraid of the
responsibility of the care of such valuable birds, especially as I had
read of their liability to crack their skulls, flying up against the wire
of the flight or against the ceiling of the bird-house. To place taut
string netting across a flight 30 feet by 24 feet we agreed was out of
the question, so we decided to let them take their chances. The hen,
at first, could only manage to reach the perch in the large cage I put
them in, but after a while, being given her complete liberty, she flew
better and now flies as well as the cock.
The first year the Bourke's did not breed but, in February of the
following year, I placed a wooden box, 12 in. X 6 in. X 6 in., with
a block of peat in the bottom and very soon the hen took to the nest.
On 24th April she came off the nest and had a tremendous bath in
a large flower-pot saucer. I seized the opportunity to examine the
nest. Three little lumps of white down, that resembled white mould,
turned out to be chicks, ranging from three to six days old. The
youngest died the first week. The remaining two were successfully
reared and again the hen went to nest and raised three more. When
these were flying, the hen began to lay again, but I decided to remove
the nest-box for that year. This year the hen has raised her first nest
and is hatching her second brood at the time of writing. Of course,
individual Bourke's differ in constitution and tastes. Our Bourke's
would never touch oats, but were very fond of chickweed and groundsel,
and they both seemed to like the heads of daisies. Heat I have never
had in the house and, although my pond in the garden the last two

winters had 6 inches of ice on it, the drinking water in the bird-honse
has never frozen, the thermometer never going lower than 35* ; this
is on account of the walls of the bird-house being double and covered
with rubberoid outside, and the roof being thatched over corrugated
iron and matchboarded inside. The front of the house faces south
and has an entrance under the eaves of the roof about one foot high,
which runs along the entire length of the house ; this is left open all
the year round, and the Bourke's can fly in and out as they desire,
although always driven in before sunset. The hen has never been
eggbound, neither have they ever dashed themselves against the wire,
this no doubt on account of the flight being so high--12 feet.
Our birds delight in bathing and the young Bourke's eat a quantity
of groundsel. As was mentioned before, we are careful to drive the
birds in about sundown, as they seem very stupid when the light is
failing ; and, when the light has gone, it is a hopeless proposition to
induce them to enter the house.
I should consider, judging from our own pair, that Bourke's are
some of the very easiest birds to breed one could hope for, providing
of course they have a large flight to ensure plenty of wing exercise
and a house unaffected by changes of our uncertain climate. They are
exceedingly small eaters and I would not hesitate to say that a dozen
Bourke's would not eat as much seed as one pair of Budgerigars. It is
essential to have a large flight if one wants to see the Bourke's at their
best, for they have a wonderfully pretty and varied flight. They sail
out of the house very much resembling the flight of a Partridge and,
when chasing each other or being chased by the Budgerigars, their
flight is really amazing, the marvellously quick swoops and quick
change of direction makes one hold one's breath in the fear they will
crash. To see Bourke's in a shower of rain is a sight to remember,
their contortions in endeavouring to get the rain to all their parts
almost persuade one the birds are having a fit ; first one wing is lifted
as they lay on their side, and then the other ; the tail is then elevated
over their heads, in fact, I have more than once seen them somersault
off a branch in their excited exertions. I have bred Budgerigars for
over ten years and find them much more trouble to breed than
Bourke's.

The cock evidently does not come into the full glory of his plumage
until two years of age, and therefore anyone seeing a young Bourke
is apt to be slightly disappointed after reading the glowing descriptions
of their beauty, but once they have reached their maturity they are
really most lovely birds. When the young birds first leave the nest and
fly out into the flight they look rather like little brown saints, for the
white fluff of babyhood makes a sort of halo round their heads. My
entire flight is entirely covered with grass, mostly rye, which is mown
in the autumn, and the Bourke's enjoy running through the grass.
I attribute our success in breeding these birds to : firstly, a very healthy
locality ; secondly, to a tight well-built house that keeps an even
temperature ; and thirdly, to a large and high flight where the birds
can fly properly and have plenty of room to turn, swoop, and soar.
Given these three things, I think anyone with the minimum of knowledge
of birds could successfully breed them.
P.S.--Recently I have been giving the Bourke's spinach beet, which
they greedily devoured without any hesitation.

The outbreak of war found me on my second trip to Ecuador (for
live birds this time) and just making the final preparations to leave
for home, but this was impossible under the circumstances, so I had
to remain there until the middle of the next year by which time the
seas were free again.
I had made a wonderful collection of birds. Tanagers formed the
greater part, and such a display of colour it would be hard to beat.
Travelling boxes are not the best accommodation in which to keep
birds for any length of time and, as I was unable to provide anything
better until some months later when I had a house to myself, many
of them died and I had to return to the forests to renew part of the

collection. Some species, especially those from the Amazonian side of
the Andes, were for various reasons not replaced. At that time sailings
were irregular and ships few and far between, with usually only
a few days' notice, besides which, companies did not care to carry
live stock in war time ; so when an opportunity came to leave I had
to hurry off at once without being able to make all the preparations
I should have liked.
Among the birds not replaced were a few worth special mention
as they still have not been brought here alive. One was a Yulturine
Parrot ( Geepsittacus vulturinus), which I had had for many months
and was very tame. I had got it from the Indians who had, no doubt,
reared it by hand from the nest as they do most of their parrots. This
bird must not be confused with Pesquet's Vulture-headed Parrot
(Dasyptilus) from New Guinea, a very much larger bird, of which
a fair number have been imported, and which in its habits more
resembles a Lory. The former is a medium-sized Parrot of rich greens,
a blackish head with white markings, and orange shoulders gives a rough
description of it. Mine was not in the least noisy, and was very
intelligent. I expect it is rare in Ecuador as I never met with it in
the forests on either of my visits.
Another was the Laminated Mountain Toucan ( Andigena laminirostris)
found high up on the western side of the Andes. The few members
of this beautiful and uncommonly coloured genus all come from high
altitudes, some from as high as 11,500 feet and have breasts of pale
greyish blue. In laminirostris the upper mandible looks as if the outer
surface has been peeled off, leaving only a semi-detached piece on either
side at the base. Its local name is " Palengo ".
A third very curious bird was the Toucan-like Barbet ( Tetragonops
rhanphastinus). I had two of these, which are very different in shape
and appearance to any of the Barbets of the old world ; and, in its
colours and the arrangement of them, corresponds almost exactly to
the Laminated Toucan, being olive, blue grey, black, white, scarlet, and
yellow, and has a bulky-looking head. The bill is not in the least like
a Toucan's, as it is very short and thick with long hard bristles at the
base. It inhabits the same locality as the Toucan, and is usually
met with in small parties of four or five high up in the trees, feeding

entirely on fruit. I never once heard mine make any sound at all.
They were steady cage birds from the first, and quickly settled down.
The Quichua Indians call them " Yumbos ", which is also their
name for the forest-dwelling Indians.
Of the birds I lost, perhaps the one I prized the most of all was
a single example of the White-capped Tanager ( Sericossypha elbocristata),
a bird as large as a Thrush. Except for the cap and upper breast, it
is entirely black with a satin-like gloss. The breast is shining crimson,
and the top of the head pure white of a velvet-like texture, altogether
making a striking-looking bird. The female is only a trifle less
beautiful, the red being more of a claret shade, and not so extensive,
and the cap of a less pure white. In any case, they are rare and come
only from the Amazonian side of the Andes at about 7,000 feet.
Although I spent two months in the locality where I caught my male,
I only twice saw a small flock of five or six, and both within a few days
of one another, so it may have been one and the same. The Quichuas
do not know this bird, and had never seen it. I think I lost mine, after
having had it several months, through eating a fruit something like
a large elderberry, which was sold in the Quito market. All the birds
were passionately fond of it, but on some it had a very intoxicating
effect. A few died through it, but others recovered after the effects
had worn off, yet all the small Tanagers eat it with impunity. I think
this also caused the death of the Barbets.
The last bird I must mention was the Coroneted Manakin (Masius
coronulatus) . I had three of these and the first died several months
before the others ; the last one at sea. It is far more active and graceful
than the other species which have been over here. It is intensely black,
with the under side of the wings primrose yellow. The crown is also
the same colour, and ends on the nape in tiny stiff scale-like brown
feathers, while those on the forehead are compressed into a slight
crest. A fine of yellow down the throat widens into a patch of the
same on the breast. Altogether an exquisite little bird. The legs,
which are rather longer than those of most Manakins, and the feet are
red. I have forgotten the Quichua name for it, but it comes from the
Western Andes. This bird also eats the berries I mentioned, without
any ill effects.

Ecuador is not an easy country for tlie collector as the inhabitants
know nothing of bird catching. If they would only climb trees it
would be a great help in setting the nets, but whenever I suggested
it I was invariably asked if I thought they were monkeys. The best
tree climbers I have met with anywhere are the Dyaks of Borneo,
who will tackle anything and who, with their superb physique, far less
resemble monkeys.
The lowlands of the Pacific coast are exceedingly unhealthy, and
it would be very difficult indeed to work upwards through the forests
from there ; besides all the best Tanagers come from the intermediate
and higher altitudes, and away from the coast few inhabitants are
met with until the central highlands are reached. The plan I adopted
was to make Quito, which is over 9,000 feet up, my base and work
over the tops of the western and eastern ranges from there. But
here again are difficulties as high passes have to be crossed wherever
one goes. That over the Eastern Cordillera at 16,500 feet is more
often than not under snow, with treacherous bogs on either side
into which a man would sink, without a good local guide. I have
crossed this pass five times and never lost my fear of it, but the last
time was the only one when I had livestock with me. On that occasion
when we got to the actual foot of the pass, we rested for a while in
a turf hovel, and here still further covered the cages with every article
of clothing we could spare, almost to suffocation, for at times the wind
on the top is so strong it tears the clothing on your back. I had some
tame Parrots with me and these I put inside my shirt, while my
companion filled his up with Marmozets. Once over, and below the
snow and slush, we rested in a small sheltered gully to unload ourselves
of livestock, and had not lost one. Here, in the warmer sunshine we
fed and watered the birds. That night, still in the cold, we had to sleep
in a ruined turf hut with the wind whistling through chinks in
the walls.
These high altitudes above the bush zone are called " paramos "
(wilderness) and are bleak and forbidding except on sunny days.
Yet some species of Humming Birds dwell there, feeding on small
Alpine flowers. When camping on Pichincha above Quito at 15,000
feet, several times at the close of day I saw the small Puff-leg (Eriocnemis

nigrivestis) fly past the camp in a snowstorm evidently to sleep among
the crags which form part of the rim of the crater above. This species
is black with a sapphire blue throat and under tail-coverts, and white
down puffs on the legs. On sunny days at the same camp I collected
two other species of the same genus, E. luciani and E. mosquera, but
usually these two are found on the bushes lower down. Another
exquisite species also up there is Oreotrochilus pichinchce, a good sized
bird with a purple blue head and a white breast. This and 0. chimborazo
of course take their names from the mountains they inhabit, but where
they overlap they breed together, the offspring being a mixture of the
two. Lord Rothschild had a fine series of such in his collection.
Pichincha is, or was, a veritable paradise for Humming Birds, but
I fear by now the bird shooters from Quito have enormously reduced
their numbers, some kinds even to extinction. The camp I am writing
about was on the eastern side and, between that and Quito, many more
than a dozen different species were to be met with, feeding on the
flowering bushes which cover the slopes. Some are permanent residents
while others come only at certain seasons. Some years only a few of
some kinds appear, or none at all. Where they migrate to has never
yet been discovered, doubtless to the slopes of some of the other great
mountains in that region as yet unfrequented by man. The species
common to bush ranges of the Andes are very few indeed, or have
marked differences. Even on Pichincha a species is confined to one side
only, as the vegetation it entirely different on the eastern and western
sides. It seems to me that with few exceptions the mountain Humming
Birds are far more beautiful, and have more eccentric forms than those
from the hot lowlands. These are far too numerous to mention more
than a few. Among the former are all the White Puff-legs and one with
black puffs. These are very conspicuous even when the birds are at
rest, but when in flight and seen from behind, they look like a snow-
white pad on each side of the tail. Then you have the real long tails
(train bearers) like Lesbia victories so common in all the gardens of
Quito, and L. gouldi gracilis , while a little lower down in the western
range is Cyanolesbia gorgo with a long broad peacock-blue tail, and
on the eastern at a corresponding altitude C. mocoa with an emerald
green one. The Swordbill (Docimasies ensiferus ) has a bill quite

and tail together. These feed on the trumpet-shaped flowers of various
kinds of datura and are met with at over 11,000 feet on both ranges
of the Andes. True, the very dull coloured Sickle-bills of the genus
Eutoxores are lowland, but as a set off in the mountains is the turned
up bill of Avocettula, also the White and Yellow Puff-legged Racquet
Tails, and the Thorn-bills in that lovely genus Rlnamplnomicron and
a host of others. One must not forget the largest of all the Hummers,
Patagonas gigas, a very dull-coloured bird as large as a swallow. Some
of these are resident all the year round in the Chillo Valley just below
Quito, and feed on the flowers of the aloe, also making their nests on
the branches of the giant flower stalk of that plant. In the summer this
bird is found as far south as Chile. Another remarkable form is the
Toothed bill (Androdon cequatorialis), also with an extra size in bills
curiously hooked at the tip, and serrated along the sides. This occurs
at about 5,000 feet and for a long time was very rare indeed until
rediscovered. I know of only two localities now where it is found.
From the lowlands of South America, perhaps, the species in the
genus Lophornis are the most eccentric with their crests and frills,
although not particularly bright they are very minute. Here to my
mind Topaza pyra and T . pella are the most striking-looking birds, and
have a wide range through Amazonas. They are large birds with the
whole body richly coloured more or less crimson, and throats that
are indescribable. Both species have two long central tail-feathers,,
curved slightly, and crossed over. In the temperate climate of Chile
there is a beautiful species, Eustaphanes galeritus. It has a marvellous,
cap like burnished copper, and a pretty spotted breast. It is all
around Valparaiso and feeds on the eucalyptus flowers when in season..
At Quilpue in mid-winter, when the ground was white with frost every
morning, they were about in the gardens as soon as the sun came up.
Another similar bird, but with a bright coffee-coloured breast, comes
from the little island of Juan Fernandez, celebrated as the home of
Alexander Selkirk, and the sinking of the Dresden.
Now Humming Birds have become popular with aviculturists, and
the Zoo has made such a beautiful display of them, it seems to me it
would be better to get some of these mountain species which would

not require so much care in the way of special heating. Anyone with
only a small conservatory could make an equally fine show, and at
a comparatively small cost. I have had no experience with Hummers
in captivity, and from what I had seen of their behaviour in a wild
state, I never thought it would be possible to keep them together, but
the Zoo has proved they can be so kept.
The first time I went to Ecuador to collect skins, I paid special
attention to Humming Birds, with the result that in Northern Ecuador
alone I collected about one hundred and fifty species including several
new ones. The first I saw alive were on the little Dutch island of
Curayoa in the West Indies, and were feeding on some bushes in front
of the post office. I was standing within two or three feet and could
easily have caught them in a butterfly net; indeed, later on in South
America I often did. Most people associate them solely with tropical
forests and beautiful flowers as I once did, so it came almost as a shock
to see them sitting prosaically on the telegraph wires along dusty
roads, or high up in the cold on misty mountain sides. They often sit
inactive for long stretches at a time, as many may have noticed at the
Zoo. Some are very crepuscular and are feeding when it is almost
too dark to see them. Perhaps the smallest of all, but with a name
longer than itself, Choetocercus bomhus, is no larger than a humble-bee,
and was found feeding on the flowers of the coffee bushes at Santo
Domingo in Ecuador, in the company of hawk-moths, when it was
too dusk to distinguish between them. I remember on more than
one occasion when I was skinning birds in Quito, Petasophom
iolata flew in the room and, hovering at the edge of the table by my
elbow, pulled at the cotton wool I was using to built a nest by the
window. These same birds were often about the rooms searching for
spiders near the ceilings.
At present, I think most people are only attracted by their
diminutive size ; but the time, no doubt, will come when the larger
kinds will be equally appreciated and the more curious and beautiful
ones desired.
It is just possible that some of the high mountain Hummers might
suffer when brought down to the coast, but once at sea they should be
all right. The only high-mountain birds which died with me were the

Eed-crested Cotingas ( Heliochera ruhrocristata), of which I had seven

By Hans Stefani (Neuss, Germany).
Amongst all the kinds of pheasants hitherto known, the Eared
Pheasants or Crossoptilons show the greatest tameness and familiarity
towards human beings. After a short period of training they can be
kept in the open without any hesitation, if their owner has a fenced-in
garden at disposal which is not too small. To begin with, for reasons
of safety, it would be desirable to cut the wing feathers of one wing.
However, when they have become familiarized with the local conditions,
and when, after moulting, the cut wing feathers grow again, it is not
to be feared that they will fly away, but of course in stating this it is
assumed that they will not be chased by dogs.
The Eared Pheasant quickly gets to know his attendant, and follows
him like a dog, if he is trained by little bits of food being given him
from time to time. Strangers, but also many persons that he has got
to dislike in his daily intercourse, the cock especially will attack by
pecking severely with his beak. In this connection it is often amusing
to observe how the very appearance of such a person leads the Eared
Pheasant cock to run up quickly, even from a considerable distance,
in order to drive the person whom he regards as an interloper out of
his reach.
Both sexes are of the same colour. The hen can only be distinguished
from the cock by the absence of the spur. The cock, however, only
grows the spur during the second year of his life, so that in younger

birds it is not possible to distinguish the sexes with certainty. Eared
Pheasants are monogamous. In captivity they lay from 15 to 30 eggs.
In the wild state, on the other hand, they are said to lay only about
eight eggs. The laying period begins in April. Every second day, but
at the beginning only every third day, the hen lays one egg, which is
light greenish-grey.
In captivity they do not often hatch their own eggs ; it is generally
necessary to make use of broody hens as fosters.
The chickens grow uncommonly rapidly, producing the beautiful
feathers of the adults in the autumn of the first year of their lives,
that is, at the age of a few months, and after that they can scarcely
be distinguished from the old birds. No other kinds of pheasant grows
so rapidly.
Of the three species of Crossoptilon, the Brown, the Blue, and
the White, only the first mentioned is comparatively frequently
found with us in captivity. It bears the scientific name of Crossoptilon
manchuricum, apparently because it is not found in Manchuria !
Indeed, its home is the most southern part of Mongolia. According
to Beebe ( Monograph of the Pheasants) it is found to the west of Pekin,
in the district traversed by the Hoangho, which are for the most part
very wild. It is therefore not sensitive to the influences of weather, and
can easily bear even strenuous cold.
The Brown Eared Pheasant, or Manchurian Crossoptilon, is not
suitable for small enclosures. In such he almost always shows a vice
which completely destroys his beauty. In order to pass his time he
for the most part becomes a feather-eater ; one bird bites off the
beautiful tail feathers of its companion, so that the Pheasants, in such
a mutilated condition, with their tails not unlike brushes, no longer
have any claim to beauty. It is quite different, however, when they
are at liberty and where a large garden is at their disposal. There they
have other occupations, and also of course much more varied food,
because, although they are for the most part herbivorous, they also
do not despise insects and worms. When kept in this way they do not
adopt the vice of eating feathers, and they always appear in their full
beauty. Also when kept in freedom they enter into much more intimate
relations with their keeper than if they are compelled to pass a miserable

existence in small enclosures. They are the tamest of all the Pheasants,
and are beautiful ornaments to large gardens. They do not scratch,
but they do, with their beaks, search the ground for anything edible ;
but the slight amount of damage which they do in this way is scarcely
perceptible in a big garden.
The trained glance of the experienced attendant can draw certain
conclusions with regard to the sex in the case of the Brown Crossoptilon,
even when they are young. The fact is that the hen for the most part
holds her wings more carelessly than the cock, who is in the habit of
carrying his wings a little higher, so that in his case the white area on
the back appears narrower than with the hen. There is also a difference
in size, the cock being slightly the larger and he has a somewhat broader
head than the hen. All these features, however, do not guarantee
against wrong conclusions, the only sure sign of the cock being the
spur, but this is missing in his youth.
Crossoptilon auritum , the Blue Eared Pheasant, is one of the greatest
rarities among Pheasants. Its original home is in the province of Kansu
in Central China, and the easterly part of Tibet. It only breeds in
a limited way ; in a free wild life broods of only six or seven chickens
are observed, of which, of course, again only a small proportion escapes
all dangers and attains the age of reproduction. Its greatest enemy,
however, is man, because the natives are always after him, on account
of his tail feathers being used as ornaments for the helmets of high
Chinese officers. As only the four middle feathers can be made use of
in this way, the bird, in consequence of being constantly hunted,
has already become a rarity even in its own homeland. It is
unfortunately only too likely that it will be exterminated in a not
far distant future.
But the difficulty of obtaining this bird is not easily overcome ;
its home has neither navigable waterways nor railways. As the only
means of conveyance, there is the caravan journey on the shoulders
of coolies during which the birds, newly caught, have to be conveyed
over distances of more than 1,000 km. before a ship or a railway receives
them and carries them to a Chinese port. For months they are exposed
to the strain of a caravan journey, shut up in small carrying-baskets,
which render any movement of the birds impossible, and transmits

to them every jerk of the carriers; fed in a defective way and contrary to
their nature, exposed to the alternations of heat and cold, exhausted and
weakened, only a portion reach their preliminary goal, a Chinese port,
alive. There they first of all require to be looked after for weeks in order
to regain some strength, and being reinvigorated, to start on the second
part of their journey, a sea voyage of almost 20,000 km., which brings
them to a French port, from where, finally, after a further railway
journey of se veral days, they reach their final destination, the enclosure
of an aviculturist. The danger that after such enormous strain, they
carry in them a disease germ and soon succumb to it, is of course
very great, and one can only breathe freely and call his birds one's
own, if they are still safe and sound one or two months after their
arrival.
The Blue Crossoptilon presumably reached Europe for the first time
alive a few years ago. In the year 1929 a French fancier imported
twenty of these birds, among which, however, there was only one single
hen, which unfortunately, a few weeks after its arrival on European
soil, perished. Therefore only cocks were left, which were used for
crossing with Brown Crossoptilons. Unfortunately, the resulting hybrids
were then quite falsely offered as Blue Eared Pheasants, so that we shall
soon have similar unsatisfactory conditions to record with the Blue
Crossoptilon as have existed for about eighty years through the crossing
of Amherst and Gold Pheasants. As is known, Lady Amherst, a hundred
years ago, imported into Europe two cocks of this species of Pheasant
which were named after her. Some decades later also, first of all, only
cocks arrived here, which, in consequence of the lack of hens of the
same breed, were crossed with the closely allied Gold Pheasants, so
that nowadays, unfortunately, we have far more of the crossbreed
than pure-bred Amherst Pheasants.
The Blue X Brown hybrids offered as Blues are, however, easily
recognizable. They have not the clear colour of the blue birds, but
a blue-black, which appears of a dirty colour. Anyone who is acquainted
with pure-bred Blue Crossoptilon will not confuse the blue-brown
hybrids with them.
The Blue Crossoptilon is quite differently marked to the Brown.
In the case of the blue species the body and also the back, in its whole

length, is uniform blue, as well as the upper part of the tail; only
on the two sides of the lower part of the tail there is a white speculum.
In the Brown Crossoptilon, on the other hand, the rear part of the
back and the upper part of the tail are almost white. These light-
coloured parts of the body are entirely absent in the case of the Blue
species.
The same careless holding of the wings which was mentioned in the
case of the Brown Crossoptilon as a special feature is not shown by
the hen of the Blue. On the other hand, with her the blue colouring
is somewhat lighter than in the case of the cock, and the carriage of
the Blue cock is somewhat prouder, more upright, whilst the hen is in
the habit of carrying herself more horizontally. But whether these
features are generally applicable or are only a peculiarity of the hen
observed by me remains an open question. As there is only this single
hen in Europe, comparative observations could, of course, not be
carried through any further. It is only the spur of the cock, in this
species also, which is a certain indication as to the sex. This is absent
in the hen.
A pure-bred pair of Blue Eared Pheasants, cock and hen, imported
directly from China is, however, in the possession of a German
aviculturist. But unfortunately, this is the only pure-bred pair at
present in Europe. But as both birds, in consequence of the present
unrest in China, took nearly six months on their voyage from their
homeland (Kansu) to Europe, and stood it in good condition, and have
meanwhile fully become accustomed to their new home, it is to be
assumed that in the near future really pure-bred Blue Crossoptilons
will be bred in Europe. The egg is light greyish-brown.
The first of the pictures shows Brown and the second one
a pair of Blue Eared Pheasants. It is true that the brown and blue
colours cannot be recognized in the pictures, but on the other hand the
difference in the distribution of the white colour of the two species is
very dear.
Crossoptilon tibetanum, the White Crossoptilon, is probably at the
present time not represented with us in captivity. It came to Europe,
however, some forty years ago. The Zoological Gardens of London
and Berlin possessed it. In the Berlin Zoo some eggs were also laid,

but chickens were not hatched. Meanwhile this beautiful bird has
unfortunately died out again in Europe. South-Eastern Tibet is its
home. The northern limit of its area of distribution touches the southern
limit of the Blue Crossoptilon, so that hybrids occur between these
two species in nature. The celebrated English investigator, Elliott,
regarded these as a distinct species, and mentions them in his work,
Monograph of the Phasianidae as Crossoptilon drouynii. Later it
turned out, however, that they were hybrids between the Blue and the
White species, which occur there occasionally in the wild condition in
the areas of distribution where the two touch each other.
It is to be hoped that the introduction of the White Eared Pheasant
into Europe will, in the near future, be crowned with success again.
We should then have at our disposal all the three species of that group
of ornamental Pheasants which, through their very remarkable tameness
and familiarity towards human beings, appear to be likely to give us
as much pleasure as tame poultry-yard and garden birds of peculiar
beauty, as Peacocks have already done for centuries past.
MR. SHAW MAYER'S COLLECTION
Mr. Shaw Mayer reached London early in July from his latest
collecting trip in North-East New Guinea, and, as usual, brought home
a number of rare and beautiful birds, many of which had not before
been imported alive. They were from the Kratke Mountains and New
Britain.
There were three adult males, one adult female, and several immature
Prince Rudolf's Bird of Paradise ( Paradisornis rudolfi), three males and
two females of the Lesser Superb Bird of Paradise ( Lophorhina superha
minor), one male Drepanornis alhertisi cervinicauda.
Of Parrots, there was a pair of White-eared Black-capped Lories
(.Lorius hypcenochrous) from New Britain, thirteen Stella Lories
[Charmosyna stellce), and four examples of the lovely melanistic form
of this bird which has been named Charmosyna atrata. One pair of the
rare Parrot, Neopsittacus musschenbroeki, which has the appearance of
a Lorikeet ; one Charmosynopsis pallidior, the form of the Fair Lory

BREEDING NOTES FROM M. DECOUX
The present breeding season has so far been rather good in spite of the
rainy weather. I was very successful with my pair of Scaly-breasted Lorikeets
which I bought two years ago. They have a couple of young in the nest now,
and since last Christmas they have reared five young ones. The following
Parrakeets have bred this year, some young being still in the nest: Barrabands,
Stanleys, Red-rumps, Crimson-wings, Bauers (one pair had two nests, and
three young are still in the box), Swainson's Lorikeets, Mealy Rosellas,
Yellow-bellied and Yellow-rumped Parrakeets. The eggs of the Swift
Lorikeets were addled.
Among small Finches, the Masked Fire Finches have young ready to leave
the nest. I have some hybrid Long-tailed Grass Finch X Bengalese, funny
little things with yellow bills which rather take after their father, the
Grass Finch. I also bred four hybrids from a Munia castaneithorax cock and
Bengalese hen, which have just left the nest and look like young Chestnut-
breasted Finches. The ordinary species of Australian and African Finches
are nesting. I have been particularly successful with Parrot Finches and
Bichenos.
The Doves and Quails have not done so well this year. I had a lot of
clear eggs from pairs that bred freely last year. I was very unlucky with
my Wonga-Wonga Pigeons ; the hen died after laying in April and I was
unable to get another. Do you know anybody who can help me to pair my
odd cock ? This species is rather difficult to breed. A pair of young were
reared by my old pair two years ago but I have been unable to rear any
since.

A NEW PLOVER
I have recently received four specimens of a very elegant Plover, which
I believe to be new to aviculture, unless it has been previously exhibited
at the Zoological Gardens. It is Scarciophorus tectus, and is an African species,
ranging from Abyssinia and Somaliland right across the continent to

Senegambia. It is a particularly graceful, slenderly-built bird, rather high
on the legs and very slim in the body, but its most noticeable feature--
and this is very pronounced--are the feathers of the crown of the head,
which form a kind of crest, but instead of standing upright in the manner
of a Lapwing's crest, they stretch out beyond the back of the head in
a horizontal manner.
Somewhat in this fashion.
I can only compare them, in a miniature way, to the crest or feathers on
the top of the head of the Houbara Bustard, or of the Hammerhead Stork.
This gives these Plovers an air of great distinction from other closely allied
species and, indeed, they are most showy and charming birds. The colour
is roughly as follows : Above, sandy-brown ; the wing-coverts tipped with
white ; quills black ; rump and tail white ; the latter with a broad terminal
band of black. Crown of head black, extending down the neck : frontal line
white ; lores black ; sides of neck black, with broad band of white ; throat
black; breast and under parts white ; bill and legs coral pink.
It is certainly one of the most showy of the Charadriidce. AH Plovers
make delightful aviary birds : they quickly become tame, are fairly hardy
when acclimatized, though always delighting in plenty of sun, and are ready
to go to nest in suitable aviaries, all of which make them most desirable
assets from an avicultural point of view.

QUEEN ALEXANDRA PARRAKEETS AND THEIR STRANGE
BEHAVIOUR IN CAPTIVITY IN AUSTRALIA

In 1925, ten young Queen Alexandras were taken from nests and hand-
reared from somewhere near Oodnadatta in South Australia. It was my good
fortune to secure these birds. Two pairs remained in my aviaries, and the
remaining three pairs were distributed between three friends.
A very anxious fortnight was spent negotiating for the purchase of these
rarities. Word was received that the Alexandras were about. A few weeks
later, the wife of the man who had caught these birds came to town. No time
was lost in finding out where she was staying, and, paying a visit, I was
asked to make an offer, and did so. The next day, the lady went to a friend
of mine to see if he was interested. My friend decided to let me negotiate
on condition that he had one pair. This was agreed, and the following day
I again saw our lady friend and increased my offer. This was accepted, and
a wire was sent asking for the birds to be sent down by rail. In due course

the ten birds arrived ; the excitement of going to meet the train can be
imagined, especially as I had not seen a live specimen. Later, I met the
husband, and he informed me that I was very fortunate to get the Parrakeets
as he was not at home when the wire arrived, and he intended bringing them
down when he came to town. He said if he had been home the birds would
not have been sent. Anyway, he must have celebrated the sale, as the cheque
was received by him and then lost, and I had to send another cheque.
The second season one pair went to nest, laying five eggs, all of which
were fertile. All hatched, but were dead on the following day. The following
season another attempt was made with the same result.
Mr. F. P. Kell, who had one of the pairs, was very fortunate in 1928, when
his birds nested in a log about 3 feet long, 5 inches in diameter, hanging
horizontally, and reared two fine young ones. The next two seasons this pair
nested, but allowed the young to die. Later, Mr. Kell disposed of his birds,
and I secured his four Alexandras.
Each season mine nested, and they continued to let the young die as soon
as hatched. Once an egg was transferred to one of Dr. Hamilton's Red Rumps,
but this venture ended in failure.
In 1931 my old pair hatched three young and went on rearing for about
three days and then two died, the remaining one was taken away and hand-
reared by Mr. W. H. Foglia.
In 1932 the old pair which I secured from Mr. Kell and my old pair
both went to nest within a week of each other. They both had four eggs.
This time both cocks were removed after the hens commenced sitting.
This was a partial success. Mr. Kell's hen hatched three, and reared them
for three weeks, and then threw one out. When discovered, it was nearly dead
and only lived a couple of hours. The other two were taken away at once
and successfully hand-reared.
After the other hen had been sitting a fortnight two of the eggs were
removed and given to a Bourke's which had been sitting a week (the Bourke's
eggs were removed). This experiment was made in desperation and was
a wonderful success, as both eggs were hatched and the young reared until
they were independent. I must say I was surprised when the Bourke's
continued feeding : I was expecting to have to hand-rear after a fortnight.
The other hen hatched her two eggs and reared the young until a month
old and then deserted them. When this was discovered one young was dead ;
the other one was at once removed and successfully hand-reared. Next
season I intend to transfer all the eggs.

I have in my aviaries a pair of Red-legged Barbary Partridges (Alectoris

Have her ; she was so weak and exhausted that she let me pick her up quite
easily although, as a rule, she is not at all tame.
The cock went back to the nest, continued to sit, and eventually hatched
every single one of the nine eggs. Since then he has been a model parent,
and looks after his brood just as the hen used to do. Some days after
I removed the hen I discovered a rotten nest with six eggs, which I have
put under a hen, but it is too soon to find out whether these eggs are fertile.
I am rather curious to know whether it is usual in the Partridge family
for the cock to take over all responsibility in bringing up the family ; or
whether what happened in my aviary is an unusual freak.

I have pleasure in reporting a very curious and successful breeding of
three pairs of Australian Parrakeets, which commenced laying on 14th April,
1933, each pair laying four eggs, and all commenced serious incubation on
Easter Monday, 17th April, 1933, the result being :--
(1) Recently imported pair of Bourke's Parrakeets. Laid four eggs ;
hatched two; two were infertile. Time, eighteen days. Nest-box :
11 in. X 11 in. x 2 ft. 6 in. high, with about a 3-in. hole near top. The box
being filled with earth to within 8 in. of hole. Male bird definitely did not
assist in incubation, as suggested in Green's Reference Booh. Two birds in
practically full adult plumage left the nest on 11th June, 1933. They appeared
rather wild first day, but second day onwards they became quite steady.
Parents fed young almost entirely on soaked bread.
(2) Elegant Grass Parrakeet. Laid four eggs ; hatched three ; one died in
nest about three days old ; one egg infertile. Time, about twenty days.
The nest used was similar to that used for the Bourke's. Female only
incubated. Male bird perched on top, or on perch in front of entrance-hole,
practically the whole period. 15th June two young ones popped their heads
out of the entrance-hole, but did not leave the nest. They are fully feathered,
dark green, their heads are shaped more like Peplars than Elegants. They
are in fine condition.

a natural hollow log for these birds, which seemed to me ideal. I also placed
an old wooden travelling box on end to stand on in the event of my wishing
to inspect the nest. The outcome of this was, the birds took to the dirty
old box and laid on the bare wood, incubated and reared her young. This is
quite contrary to Lord Tavistock's reference book. The } 7 oung birds are being
fed almost entirely on wet bread.
Since writing the above, the Elegant and Rock Peplar Parrakeets have

ELECTRIC HEATING

I should be very much obliged to any of my fellow members if they
would help me with the following propositions.
I have three aviaries, warmed in the winter with hot water pipes heated
by a coke furnace. The electric main runs past my house, so I cannot help
thinking that my aviaries might be so much more easily heated by electricity.
The question is : what is the best form to use it in ? I find the tubular heating
is not much good, and I am afraid of ordinary open small stoves, but I cannot
help thinking there must be some way of making something to go over those
to keep birds out of them and getting too near the heat. I should be very
glad to hear other people's experiences in this matter. I also want to know
the cause of the failure to rear young birds. I have had numberless young
Canaries hatched out to all appearances quite healthy, strong little birds.
They have in most cases thrived well until they got to the stage when they
are nearly full-fledged, and then they are knocked out of the nest and die.
I have reared a few, but nothing like the number hatched. They have egg
food, sponge cake, and the usual seeds, and plenty of green food and grit.
I should very much appreciate any help in this matter.

THE KEA PARROT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9773116" page_id="56237544"  page_num="230" year="" vol="">
In the April number of the Avicultttral Magazine you publish a letter
on the " Kea and the imported Mynah " (House Mynah). Unfortunately,
I have not as yet been able to study the Kea at liberty, although I have seen
a number in confinement. But I know several sheep-farmers in the " Kea
country ", and not one of them has seen a Kea kill or ever attack a sheep.
Some of them " know men who have seen them ", and a few frankly
admit they believe the whole story a myth. The " supposed " method of
attack is for the bird to alight on the animal's back, flap its wing and scratch,
thus scaring it. The sheep, of course, races hither and thither and finally drops
from sheer exhaustion, and then the Kea is supposed to commit his foul deed
--I wonder ?
It may interest you to know that the Government bonus on Kea's heads
no longer exists, consequently, far fewer are now destroyed.
I cannot quite understand the " sheep farmer " mentioned in your note
on Mr. Peacock's letter, when he mentions losses through the " imported
foxes and native ravens ". There is no such bird as a " native raven " and
foxes, strange as it may seem when one considers the number of " pests "
that have been introduced, have never reached New Zealand, except as odd
specimens for our zoos.

each occasion it has cured the bird completely. It was first tried on a young
English Thrush and a young Blackbird, both of which were cured after only

one dose of the stuff. In May, the day before the Avicultural party here, my
Crowned Starling, which has just hatched off young, was found to be coughing
very badly. The bird was caught up and given five drops of Aniodol, and
put back into the aviary. The cough disappeared at once, and she successfully
reared her young. In June, a Superb Starling was treated with it, and again at
the end of June a White-winged Mynah. Within an hour no signs of gapes
were seen. It is a very simple remedy ; only five drops of the stuff is poured
into the bird's beak with a dropper, and the bird is held in the hand for
a couple of minutes to make certain that the drops are swallowed. After
the wonderful success I have had with this stuff, I would recommend all
bird lovers to keep a bottle of this most useful cure handy.
" Aniodol interne " can be bought from Laboratoires de Y aniodol, 3 Rue
des Alouettes, Nanterre, Paris, France.

TORPIDITY IN THE TKOCHILIIYE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98959346875" page_id="56237545"  page_num="231" year="" vol="">
At 10.45 p.m. on 21st June the two Humming Birds, Eupetomena
macroura and Chrysolampis moschitus, were torpid at a temperature of
66* F. Now I have always suspected that this state is not induced primarily
or necessarily by a low atmospheric temperature. I therefore deliberately
exposed the birds to more cool air (by opening an additional window), but
left the electric light burning, after moving the birds gently with a stick so
that they hung upside-down, like bats, on their respective perches. Within
ten minutes the eyes of each were open, and in a very few minutes more one
after the other flew to have a feed.
I think this proves that the torpid state is not necessarily brought on by
cold, and that it is probably a natural state of rest--a kind of very deep
sleep--provided by Nature in order that the creature's energy may be
generated for the astonishingly active life it is to lead on the following day.
We are thus forced to speculate on the possibility of hibernation in some
members of the family, which--should it be indulged in by them--would be
no more extraordinary than in the case of bats. In these latter, spread from
the Tropics to more rigorous climes, only those which are exposed to periods
of scarcity of food pass any time in a torpid state. Could not the same be
the case with the Trochilus colubris, Selasphorus rufus, Eustephanes
gallentus, and others, which at certain seasons must sometimes be caught
without food in prematurely severe weather before they can have had time
to shift their quarters ?
When I say that the birds were torpid, I mean that they showed to all
appearance no spark of life ; they could be moved about and laid out on a table
like as many dried skins. But what is, I think, important is that they should
not only remain upright on their perches but should be so smooth in feather
that they appear to have been struck dead suddenly while asleep without
having had time to alter their positions : all evidence to show that it is
a natural condition. I have no doubt that it is due to this habit that the
Trochilidse are supposed to need a very high temperature in order to be main-
tained in health. For my part I have but little hesitation in submitting them
to the ordinary atmospheric conditions provided for most foreign birds.

The bird has become torpid on several occasions with the thermometer
at 63* F. ; yet it is often active at 56* F. It has been torpid successively for
17, 15, and 20 hours within four days. I am inclined to attribute this state
more to windy weather than to cold. When we consider that in a wild state
these small birds would have great difficulty in procuring food either from
flowers or in the air during stormy weather, it does not seem very strange that
Nature should have devised a plan for preventing them from starving. It
remains to be discovered for how long at a stretch they are able to remain
in this state of what must be termed " partial hibernation
I think, moreover, it will one day be proved that the near allies of the
Trochilidse (Swifts, Nightjars, and even Colies) have the same power of
remaining unconscious for a longer or shorter period.

A HUMMING BIRD'S OUTING
Yesterday (18th July) I was rung up by a gentleman in Cuckfield, about
4 miles away, to say that he had got a Humming Bird which had been
about for a day or two, and asking if it was mine and what to feed it on.
I went over to see it and found that it was a Humming Bird and that it was
greedily sucking up Nestle's milk from blossoms stuck into the wires of
a canary-cage in which it had been put. I, of course, was able to tell the

finder that the owner must be Mr. Chaplin, and he at once took it over to
him, and I hear this morning that it is none the worse for its long outing
and the recent weather. It is a Swallow-tail (Eupetomena macroura), one of
the two of this species which Mr. Chaplin obtained when the Zoo got theirs
at the beginning of June. It escaped the day it was brought here, which
was about 8th June, so that it has been on its own for more than a month
in spite of the heavy rain and cold and in that time has not only existed
but kept fit, and must also have covered quite a lot of ground in the time,
as it has been seen (and sometimes recognized as a Humming Bird), at
Bolney, 7 miles away and other places.
Mr. Chaplin promises full details later, but I think it worth while putting
on record at once this almost unbelievable (but absolutely proved) adventure
of a Humming Bird--a second Balcombe miracle I call it, the first being
the same owner's Ruby and Topaz, which has been out-of-doors in a
small aviary for about the same time, and that without any worse effects
than occasional temporary torpidity.

SHAMAS CATCHING FISH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985600714285714" page_id="56237547"  page_num="233" year="" vol="">
I have just discovered a trait in my Shamas which I cannot recollect
having previously seen mentioned in connection with these birds.
Recently I constructed a small rock pool in the outdoor flight of my aviary
and installed therein two small minnows, whose presence was almost
immediately discovered by the Shamas, which at once started hopping round
the edge of the pool, making pecks at the minnows when they came near the
edge. I watched for some time, and as the birds were unsuccessful in their
efforts I concluded the fish were safe. However, on visiting the flight some
hours later I discovered both minnows gone, and in spite of a diligent search
round about not a sign could I discover of them, so I can only conclude that
the Shamas are better anglers than I gave them credit for. I had previously
given several dead minnows to the birds, which they at once pounced on and
devoured with evident relish, provided the fish were sufficiently small. I was
prompted to do this having remembered reading in a series of articles by
Mrs. Hammond in The Cage Bird Fancy that any small fish found among the
" dried flies " when making up Softbill food should be left in as the birds would
eat them. As I have already indicated, however, this is the first time I have
known of them being able to provide themselves with " fresh fish ".
If you think the foregoing may be of any interest to members of the
Avicultural Society, you are at liberty to use it as you think best.

SOME NOTES ON THE PRESENT BREEDING SEASON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990052" page_id="56237547"  page_num="233" year="" vol="">
In March, 1930, I purchased a pair of Alpine Chough (Phyrrhocorax
graculus). I think they are a true pair, the hen being the smaller bird. These
are in a large aviary, 60 ft. X 35 ft. x 12 ft., in which, in addition to other
birds, there are two White Jackdaws, sex uncertain. Last year the Choughs
were inclined to go to nest; they tried to build but the Jackdaws, which the

Choughs seemed afraid of, interfered, so nothing came of it. This year the
Choughs seemed masters of the Jacks, and successfully built a nest. Just
before she began to sit I examined the nest and found in it four Chough's
and three Jackdaw's eggs. After the Chough had sat three weeks or so
1 examined the eggs and found them all to be unfertile.
The Alpine Chough is not included in Dr. Hopkinson's book on birds bred
in captivity, and I wonder if this is the first record of it having done so.
I have lost by death this month a Chinese Painted Quail (Excalf actor ia
chinensis), after having laid forty-nine eggs during the season. The Quails
are housed in an aviary in which there are about fifty small foreign Finches.
The Quails keep to the floor of the sleeping quarters, which is about
15 ft. x 4 ft. They never go into the flight. I put some heather in one comer
and they had twelve eggs in the first nest; she left these and made another
nest at the other end of the aviary. These twelve eggs my gardener, George,
who attends to the birds and is a keen aviculturist, took home and set under
a Bantam, but she broke them all. The Quail then laid six more eggs :
five of these were put in a Blackbird's nest in the big aviary. These hatched
sooner than we expected; three young disappeared and two eggs left in the
nest had fully developed young in. The Quail then had a nest of thirteen eggs :
twelve of these were put under a Bantam, and she hatched ten but crushed
them all to death. The Quail then had a nest of six eggs. These she sat herself
and hatched six young. Unfortunately four of these were drowned when
2 days old in a saucer of water. The other two are now fine healthy birds.
When the two young were about 4 weeks old the Quail began to lay again,
and after laying twelve eggs died. The twelve eggs have been set under
a Bantam and better luck is hoped for this time.
I have a Spreo Starling, but which of the Spreos it is I do not know. She
has a nest of four blue eggs. In the same aviary there are two Purple-backed
Starlings and one Red-eyed Glossy Starling ; the sex of these I do not know.
The Spreo is sitting we]l, but whether the eggs will be fertile or not
I cannot say.

SUCCESS WITH FIRE FINCHES AND CORDON BLEUS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987863125" page_id="56237548"  page_num="234" year="" vol="">
I have had two rather delightful successes lately in my indoor
bird-room. First I managed to rear a Fire Finch, which left the nest on the
3rd November. This mite was reared to a great extent by electric fight!
I turned on the fight between 5.30 and 6 o'clock, as soon as I saw the parents
feeding. One day it was very stormy and the birds were in bed before 3.30
in the afternoon. It was useless fighting up in the evening ; they never took
the food and only got disturbed. The November baby was a hen, and she
and her mother sat together this month and produced between them a baby
which left the nest last Saturday. Both hens think it their own and both feed
it with the cock !
My joy on Saturday was eclipsed on Sunday by the Cordons bringing
out of their nest a baby, too ! This I do feel is a feat, as I have been trying
for four years to breed Cordons in a room. They had mealworms and ants'
eggs, but no gentles until I saw the baby ; but they have fed regularly on the
food given to the Canaries--hard-boiled egg and biscuit--one teaspoonful
of egg to two of thin arrowroot biscuit given at stated intervals, and at 1 o'clock

bread and milk sprinkled with maw. The cock Cordon called out with joy
at the bread and milk. I also gave soaked seed. A week before the baby left
the nest I found quite a large dead one on the floor. I cannot think how the
parents dragged it out of the nest; and I, thinking my hopes were dead,
didn't give any ants' eggs, and they only had the Canaries' food, so they can
rear on egg food. I read that they could in Butler's book, but until this year
my Cordons were never fertile; I think they became fertile from taking
the egg regularly from March. The baby spent the first night on the floor,
but they urged it until next day they got it on to the branches tied on to the
wall, and this evening it is sleeping beside its father. The hen has gone to
nest again with four or five eggs. The nest is cleverly hidden, and I only found
it by putting another branch on the wall and hearing the cock calling
anxiously.
I of course gave lettuce, seeding grass, shepherd's purse in seed, all at
stated intervals from 6 o'clock. I left egg food at night for the first feed, and
I kept to regular hours all day.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.964215708333333" page_id="56237549"  page_num="235" year="" vol="">
In one of my large aviaries I had a pair of Indian Ring-necked
Parrakeets nesting. A normal coloured green cock mated to a lutino hen.
Two fine young ones were hatched, and were practically reared, and would
have left the nest in a day or two, when an awful disaster befel them. One
afternoon some bees were seen near the aviary, and on our looking into the
nest-box we were horrified to see that a huge swarm of bees had settled on the
two unfortunate young ones and had smothered them. We were lucky to
save the parents by shutting them up, but it took us two days to clear the
bees from the nest-box. This is a sad experience I have never had before, and
thought it would interest members to hear of it. I am sorry to have lost two
beautiful young lutino-bred Parrakeets, which would have most probably
bred some lutinos in time, and in such an extraordinary way.

THE CALL OF THE MALEO
There cannot be many people who have heard the call of the Maleo
(Megacephalon maleo), either in confinement or, probably, even in a wild
state, unless it may be a few travellers in its native islands, but it is of such
a remarkable nature that I think it is worthy of putting on record. I have
never heard my bird, which I have had for three years, utter a sound until
yesterday, when I suddenly heard the most extraordinary noise coming from
its aviary and, hastily turning to discover the cause and the producer,
was able to see the whole performance. The Maleo was half sitting, in
a crouching position in the centre of its enclosure, with neck stretched out
and head lowered, the wings were also partially extended, the call was a very

loud, deep resonant, bubbling note, lasting for several seconds, and repeated
at short intervals of about three minutes for quite a considerable time. It is
distinctly musical, and might be likened to a loud bass tremolo on a violoncello,
but with a clear treble inflexion as well. In a wild state it would probably
be audible at a considerable distance. The bird appeared to find it an effort
to make it.

Psittacula derbyana, of the wooded valleys of the Upper Yangtse in
Western China, is caught by the Chinese on walnut trees in nooses, being
particularly fond of walnuts. The coloured picture which appeared in the
Magazine of 1926 (p. 145) gives a good idea of the bird and its colour. It is
most destructive in an aviary. Time after time my aviaries have had to be
repaired when a good deal of the wire netting had been destroyed by their
strong beaks. In 1929 Mr. Hampe, one of our members, sent me a few of
these beautiful birds from Shanghai. Although I have had them for over
four years, they never attempted to nest till this year. They were
given the choice of three nests, two of which were in the flight of the aviary
and the third inside the aviary shelter. The inside one was chosen, and the
first egg laid on 23rd April. Only two eggs were laid. All the peat moss
and sawdust that I had put into the nest-box was thrown out. One young
one was hatched on the 24th May, the other egg being unfertile. The parents
were devoted to their young, and the old birds flew at one viciously each
time one tried to enter the aviary. When the young one was about three
weeks old the parents got quite tame, and did not mind how often one entered
the aviary and looked at their offspring. The young bird left the nest on
14th July--a fine healthy, and strong bird. It resembles the male bird, but
is rather dull in colour. The beak is red at present. I believe this is the first
time this Parrakeet has been reared in captivity in Europe.

THE MASKED GRASSFINCH

The Masked Grassfinch--an inhabitant of Australia--is about
the same size and shape as a Long-tailed Grassfinch, but, though
equally slim, its general appearance is rather heavier owing to its
larger beak.
Its plumage is an attractive blend of warm golden brown, a paler
cafe-au-lait colour, black and white, with a bright yellow beak.
The sexes are difficult enough to distinguish, but, if anything, the
various black areas in the plumage are less extensive in the hen ; nor
is her back of quite such a rich golden brown, and in some cases, she
is just preceptibly the smaller bird of the two.
With all birds, where the cock and hen are so alike as in this case,
it is a difficult and dangerous matter to lay down any hard and fast
rule for sexing them. I say " dangerous " because of the ensuing
chorus of disagreement to which one invariably exposes oneself. One
has only to state that the hen of a particular species is smaller than
her mate for a number of people instantly to discover that judging
by their pair, the hen is quite obviously much the larger bird of the
two !
Similarly, one only has, tentatively, to venture the opinion that

Edward J. Boosey--The Masked Grassfinch
a particular bird (and even one that is notoriously " difficult ") is
a rather shy breeder, for someone to rush forward with the startling
news that, on the contrary, their pair behave, and always have behaved,
quite like guinea pigs, producing so many young ones that their harassed
owner simply doesn't know what to do with them ! And they are
probably right ; but only about the particular pair of that species
they happen to be fortunate enough to own.
As a boy I possessed a pair of Zebra Finches whose irritating
behaviour was such as to justify me in supposing that of all the difficult
triumphs of aviculture, none was more unattainable than the successful
rearing of a brood of Zebra Finches !
The reason for this diversity of experience is, of course, the
infinite variety of behaviour, temperament, size, and colouring to be
met with among individual birds of the same species ; and if this
applies to Finches it is doubly true of the more sensitive Parrots and
Parrakeets. It is, therefore, obviously unsafe to generalize, for whereas
one pair of birds in a particular aviary will rear large families, to their
owner's delight, another pair of the same species will often fail to rear
anything at all, though housed in precisely the same type of aviary
and even under the same management.
I am now going to be rash enough to assert that here at the Keston
Foreign Bird Farm we have found that, though young Masked are
reared every year, they cannot be considered quite such easy or prolific
breeders as their cousins, the Long-tail. They are by nature much
shyer birds, and therefore take considerably longer to settle down in
a new environment ; in fact, if you want to breed them you would
be well advised to put them in your most secluded aviary, otherwise,
if they have anything to disturb or distract them, your chances of
success will be small.
One point of great importance to remember when dealing with
Masked is their rooted dislike, when breeding, to fussy interference
on the part of their owners. Some particularly docile pairs there may
be who will tolerate a certain amount of nest-inspection, but they
are few indeed compared with those that will desert on the slightest
provocation.
The more experience I have of bird-breeding, the more certain

I become that the frequent failure--particularly among Finches--to
bring up their young ones successfully is due, in almost every case, to
their owners' inability to resist the temptation " just to have one
look in the nest to see how they're getting on The result is that the
parents are given a feeling of insecurity, which is fatal.
It is significant how often a person who has succeeded in rearing
a brood of notoriously shy breeders in a large aviary will end an account
of the incident with the remark : " And the extraordinary thing was
I never even knew they had young ones ! "
It is not, of course, extraordinary at all, for it provides the clue
to their- success.
In a large planted aviary they will build their nests in bushes,
but failing that they prefer an open to a closed nest-box. All our
Masked Finches are bred here in our own " Keston " wire Finch nests,
which seem to suit them admirably.
The eggs are white, and incubation lasts from 14 to 15 days, the
young ones remaining in the nest about a month.
One gentleman in California states that they are fond of carrying
pieces of charcoal into the nest, presumably in order to keep it clean
and sweet. Masked Finches are not among the earliest of breeders
and newly imported specimens, particularly, seldom settle down to
breed until late in the season.
They should be fed on a mixture of white and brown millet and
canary, but the biggest proportion should consist of the latter, since
many seem not to care much for ordinary millet. They are, however,
very fond of millet spray and green food, such as flowering grass,
spinach-beet, etc. Mealworms or other live food should be supplied
when they have a brood to feed. The young leave the nest with a
lead-coloured beak which gradually changes to yellow.
They can be wintered without heat, provided they have a well-
constructed, damp-proof shelter to roost in at night.

(Continued from page 220)
Apart from the difficulties of catching birds, collectors have many
other trials to put up with, not the least being from inquisitive people
who have no particular interest in birds and only come out of idle
curiosity to pass the time away both on shore and more especially at
sea. These people ply one with senseless questions and are generally
in the way even when they must see you are up to your eyes in work.
I am always only too delighted to show my birds to those who really
appreciate them, but the others often at times drive me to desperation.
I wonder how many times in one part of South America or another, when
I have been feeding by hand young birds, or even cleaning out and
feeding the others, onlookers have exclaimed " Que paciencia ! "
So by now I always know what is coming. Once, when going up the
Ecuadorian coast, terribly worried by the inconvenient location for the
cages and trying wind, and hurrying to get finished before the sudden
tropical darkness overtook me, several ladies were plying me with
question after question as to the name of this bird and that, till at last
I asked them if they were not ashamed to ask me, a foreigner, the names
of the birds of their own country. I added that almost any intelligent
schoolboy in mine could have told them. Perhaps not strictly true,
and less I think now than I did at the time, because lately I have hardly
once been to the Zoo without being struck by the ignorance displayed
by the general public on matters of natural history ; adults as well as
children. The remarks one overhears and the myths perpetuated one
thought long dead!
The railway station for Quito is quite outside the city, and it had
been a great work to get the cages and baggage down to it through
all the steep cobble-paved streets from where I lived, when I moved
to the coast. When at last they were all safely deposited on the platform
quite a crowd of well-dressed people rushed them under my very nose
and began tearing off the covers, which had all been so carefully tacked
down, and even turning the cages on their backs the better to see their
contents. Asiatic coolies are equally aggravating when handling live-

stock. In spite of all your instructions, more often than not immediately
afterwards, when lifting the cages they turn them upside-down.
Perhaps one of the greatest worries to contend with is panic at night
among the birds, which sometimes occurs night after night. It is
usually impossible to do anything, for a light taken among them only
adds to it and disturbs still more. It sometimes sounds as if not one
will be alive in the morning. At such times sleep for me is quite out of
the question for the rest of the night. It is so seldom a cause can be
found. Sometimes it is due to rats or other vermin, and occasionally
I have been troubled by snakes. In the Formosan forests minks were
my bugbears and came night after night to my Mikado Pheasants,
and of all birds in a panic pheasants most easily damage themselves.
In spite of various kinds of traps I only once succeeded in catching
one, and it turned out to be an entirely new species.
The journey to the coast from Quito takes the best part of two days,
so I engaged a luggage-van and travelled in it with the birds. The
night is spent at Riobamba, where all the passengers alight and join
the train again in the morning ; meanwhile the train goes back a few
miles up the line to water, where it stops the night, as it seems, under
the very snows of Chimborazo. The highest part of the line is crossed
about here at 12,000 feet. I slept in the van as the doors had to be kept
open a little way for ventilation, and bitterly cold it was ; but by
covering the cages with tent-flies, etc., I did not lose one bird. The
marmosets and a squirrel monkey I had with me under my blankets
on the floor, and much squabbling there was to get the best places before
they finally settled down.
After passing through the Panama Canal with the collection we
encountered one night a very sudden storm. On the Royal Mail boat
they had given me the second-class smoking room for my birds and,
it being hot, the windows had been left open. Many of the cages were
thrown down in wild confusion before I could get there, and a few birds
were killed and two or three escaped and were not seen again ; but
in spite of all this I managed to land in London nearly forty species of
tanagers almost, if not all, new to aviculture, ranging in size from the
big Hooded Tanagers, Ruthraupis, to the small Violet group, Euphonia .
Among these tanagers two species changed their colour in

a remarkable manner after they had moulted in captivity--one entirely
and the other partially--so it is just as well to place it on record here.
Rieffer's Grass-green Tanager, Psittospiza riefferi, is a robustly built
bird of a crude Brunswick-green, the colour garden seats are often
painted. The shoulders are pale emerald and very glossy ; the cheeks
and thighs bright chestnut; bill, legs, and feet coral red. After they
had moulted the entire green parts became a beautiful blue ; so when
they arrived over here some were still green and others blue. I gave
a skin of the latter to the Natural History Museum, and when the late
Mr. Ogilvie Grant saw it he said if anyone had sent it in he would have
had no hesitation in naming it a new species.
The other bird was the Black-chinned Mountain Tanager,
Compsocoma notabilis, a very poor name to describe such a lovely bird,
for this genus has three exquisite species : the others are victorini and
sumptuosa. I had all three, but only one specimen of notabilis, which
is larger than the other two. The back of this bird is a most unusual
shade of yellowish green with the sheen and appearance of spun glass.
This changed to a very bright mauve. It was one of the first birds
I got when I first started the collection, and it lived right through and
landed here safely.
In addition to the tanagers and other birds were eleven species of
parrots, and these were a source of much enjoyment and com-
panionship during my stay in Quito. I had rented the upper part of a
large empty house on the mountain-side above the city. On the entrance
side my floor was not much above the level of the road, but on the
other side it was a sheer drop down to the roofs below, with a marvellous
view to the south embracing snowy peaks and a half encircling line of .
volcanoes beginning with Pichincha on the immediate right. On this
side was a glass-covered corridor for the birds, which at one end led
into a small kitchen and at the other a small room which opened on
to a flat roof. The parrots practically had the run of all this side, for
they were all tame and one or two very good talkers. They included
four Pionus menstruus, with heads so exceedingly blue they thought
over here they must belong to another species ; a number (I forget
how many) of the Bronze-winged, P. chalcopterus ; two Coral-billed,
P. corallinus, which had such a powdery bloom all over their plumage

that they looked like birds modelled in plaster of Paris and artificially
coloured. A pair of Grey-headed Parrots, P. seriloides, concluded this
group, most of which I had reared by hand from the nest. They all
knew their names and each one had a very distinct personality.
Whenever I sat down in the corridor or the kitchen they swarmed all
over me, each one trying to get a favoured position. One of the Blue-
headed ones called " Verdecita " I had bought from a woman at the
door, not that I wanted it, but it was so loving and adopted me at once,
I simply had not the heart to send it away. This turned out to be one
of the most marvellous mimics I have ever known, and repeated the
scandal and laughter of some garrulous old women, one of which after
using a certain expression always went off into a fit of asthmatical
coughing. It was all so real one seemed to get to know the different
people and could easily picture them with heads together talking
scandal. This bird unfortunately met with a sad end on the coast.
I had a tame tayra shut up in a room, and going in one day I was
unaware that the parrot was following me, and the tayra rushed out
and had it in its jaws before I knew exactly what had happened.
I missed this fussy little person perhaps more than if it had been all
the others put together. I think it was my favourite, and I still have
a few of its feathers. There was " Chiquita " another of the same kind
and only a little less accomplished ; and " Toni ", not a talker but
a very droll bird. I think this is one of the most delightful of all parrots
to keep, if hand-reared, especially for a lady or an invalid, as they are
not a bit noisy and so docile and affectionate. To such I have often
recommended them since. A woman also brought to the door a Lesson's
Amazon, A. lilacina, to sell. I already had one and so again I was
disinclined to buy at first as I had so many parrots, but it came to my
hand at once and in such a hurry as if glad to escape from its owner ;
I thought it must have been ill-treated, so I succumbed again. It crowed
like a rooster and imitated many farmyard sounds. Two Red-faced
Conures were the naughty boys of the party and up to all manner of
mischief and were called the " Cossacks ". These and the Grey-headed
had full wings, so when the corridor windows were open they had to
be shut up in the kitchen. The Grey-heads I had reared from the nest
and they had always slept in a basket with two Black-capped Caiques.

<bodyText confidence="0.999760527777778" page_id="56237564"  page_num="344" year="" vol="">
The former used to go to bed themselves, but if the Black-caps were in
the corridor and I forgot them as evening came on they gave me no
peace until I took them to the others, when they immediately squeezed
out of sight beneath the larger birds. The male Caique developed
a remarkable character later, and endeared himself to many wounded
soldiers at Hoddam Castle and used to get wildly excited when the
convalescents had boxing contests. Bor long afterwards inquiries came
about him from Australia and the other Dominions from those who lived
to get home.
The kitchen had one of those built-up stoves for burning charcoal,
with the usual ventilation holes below reaching quite a long way in.
Most of the parrots slept in these, as many as four in some, and had to
enter always in the same order or there was much quarrelling. A very
great deal could be written about this family of parrots alone, and
amusing incidents connected with them, for, as I have said, each was
a character in itself. There is one incident I must mention about one
of the Bronze-wings, " Lorita " by name. Attached to the flat was
a dark unused store-room and whenever this bird was missed she
could always be found in this room watching a hole in the boards for
rats. Here she patiently sat sometimes for a whole morning, and often
had a scrap with one. I know it sounds incredible but it is, neverthe-
less, true. How she first found out the place I do not know, as it was
quite apart from the other rooms, and so dark that I often had to
strike a light before I could distinguish her.
The steep forest-covered valleys running down from the western
range to the Pacific are wonderously beautiful and abound in bird
fife of infinite variety. Perhaps one appreciates this side all the more
after crossing the bleak passes to get there, coming quite suddenly
upon such exuberant vegetation and the&apos; air getting hotter and hotter
as you descend. It makes man feel so puny besides such majesty
of rushing waters and great falls on every hand, while overtopping
all are the great snow peaks. In some parts it is possible to go on for
days without meeting a human habitation.
There is one valley in the South of Colombia very different from these
where I think it would repay a naturalist to visit. I once passed through
part of it on the way from Popayan to Pasto. It is off the usual route

and generally avoided by travellers locally as its people have a bad
reputation. It is called La Patia, is very hot, possibly unhealthy,
for it is, I believe, rather below sea-level. Why I mention it is because
I saw birds there I had not seen in any of the surrounding districts.
Collectors may have been there but I never heard of any. It is well
watered, and what inhabitants it has are all negroes. That foreigners,
and especially English, can go there and be well treated I proved.
Although in Popayan I had been warned against it by everyone,
I still intended to stay there to collect for a short time if I thought
it looked favourable, so when arranging with muleteers I stipulated
that if I did not like the look of the place I would continue on to Pasto.
The Patia is about half-way, and I had already paid in advance half
the hire of the mules to Pasto according to custom. However, before
I reached the valley I had already decided to go on, for the region seemed
isolated and, having met no mule trains en route, I began to feel if
once set down there it might be a long time before I could get away
again. The end of my journey south was to be Quito, and finally
over the Andes to the headwaters of the Amazon and home via that
river. The season too was getting advanced as I had spent more time
in Popayan and its surrounding mountains than I had intended.
The valley as we approached it from the north was quite suddenly
revealed at our feet, as we had come to the brink of a great precipice
without apparently any way down. There was a way, however, a
very steep and winding one among rocks which concealed it. Once
at the bottom, after fording many rivers or branches of the same one,
we came late in the afternoon to a small village of thatched and white-
washed huts, but without any inhabitants in sight. Here at once the
muleteers began to unload although I protested and explained that
I would go on, but they complained that my baggage was altogether
too heavy for their animals, so off they went in all haste and I was
left with my belongings in what looked like a deserted village except
for a few pigs and fowls. I knocked at the door of a house that looked
a little better than the others, and after a time a very fat negress
appeared and I explained my position. She inquired who and what
I was and when she found I was not a Colombian she thawed a little.
I must explain that I was dressed in poncho and zamaras (chaps)

and the high big-brimmed Colombian straw hat. I had been forced
to adopt this dress off the beaten tracks as ordinary riding kit proclaimed
the foreigner and caused too much excitement among the people. The
room I entered was merely a bare barn with an earthern floor, but I
soon had my camp bed up and the owner eventually sold me eggs
and a fowl. As it happened I was able after all to leave the valley the
next day, and unwillingly travelled for days with a noted brigand and
his band, who had a price on his head and was carrying out raids on
cattle and horses even during this journey, which was all very exciting
and romantic but hardly the topic for a bird journal. It is difficult
to separate purely bird matters from experiences with mammals,
reptiles, and natives as they are all so mixed up together in the life
of a collector.
While in this village I saw many Parrotlets in and out of the thatch
of some of the houses, but was unable to identify them without shooting
one, but my guns were packed and I thought it best to let them remain
so and not excite interest in them, for by then many of the people had
put in an appearance. The old lady was very frank the next day and
told me that being a foreigner I was a friend, but if I had been
a Colombian she would not have taken me in and I should have been
stripped of all I had, for it appeared that the Clovernment treated them
as outlaws. I was presented with eggs before I left, perhaps because
the night before I had given her medicine for her fever. Both on entering
and leaving the valley I saw birds I had not met with elsewhere, and
so I imagine it might have some surprises in store. As I do not suppose
I shall ever go that way again, I pass this information on to others,
although I have always had the Patia in my mind with the idea of
returning there one day. Who knows ?

vast swamps and lakes of surpassing loveliness, and with the whole
country entirely covered with the most wonderful sub-tropical forest.
It was here that the unique bird life reigned supreme.
Alas, but little is now left to give any indication of the former
wonders of the native forest, and the bleak and barren hillsides give
no witness to their former fertility except here and there where the
blackened and half-decayed stump of some forest giant, which it was
too much trouble to root out, bears mute testimony to the glories
that have passed.
Sometimes in a deep gully or kloof in the mountains we see a slight
vision of the splendour that was once New Zealand's--a few acres of
indigenous forest which someone has forgotten to burn but, alas,
sadly weeded out.
And still the sacrilege goes on. In the farthest corners the settlers
are penetrating, the last few giant kauries are falling to the axe and the
fires are sweeping through the luxuriant greenery of the forest. The
giant tree-ferns, the fuschias, the graceful nikau-palms are devoured
in a few minutes by the sweeping tongues of flame, and soon the country
is reduced to a state of desirable pasturage--all so that we can buy
frozen mutton a little cheaper.
And the birds--what of them ? Most of them have gone for ever.
They were massacred in their millions by the early settlers and by the
forest-felling gangs sent to various parts to open up the country.
Old settlers have told me that in the early days men would not
be content with the shooting of a few birds for the pot but would
kill hundreds at a time for the pure lust of killing. This specially
applied to the magnificent fruit pigeon, probably the finest and most
beautiful of all known pigeons. These were so tame and unsuspecting
that a man could stand under a fruit-bearing tree and shoot two hundred
in a morning. He would probably take away six or so and leave the
rest to rot. This, combined with the destruction of the forests, upon
which the birds were dependent for their food, by felling and burning
and also the introduction of carnivorous mammals, has placed the birds
of New Zealand in their present position, when it is possible for residents
in New Zealand to spend months in the country districts without
seeing a native bird of any kind except perhaps a few odd White-eyes.

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
On the other hand this does not account for the diminution of certain
endemic species such as the North Island Thrush, the Stitch-bird,
the North Island Robin, and the strange aberrant Wattled-Crows
which commenced to disappear from the untouched forest regions
soon after the advent of the white men into the country.
These birds (and several others) commenced to disappear for no
apparent reason whatsoever and by the beginning of the twentieth
century had practically ceased to exist. The only plausible explanation
is that the New Zealand birds were very susceptible to the germ-
carrying parasites which were brought to the country by the various
introduced species, to which they themselves had become immune.
The Robin and the Thrush, both birds which were untouched by
the colonists, commenced to disappear in the very early days of settle-
ment from the very remote parts of the country where the conditions
were the same since the beginning of time and into which no white man
had yet penetrated. Some of the birds, such as the Bell-bird, the Wattled
Crows, etc., were reckoned by the leading local authorities to be extinct
at the end of the nineteenth century but have since re-established
themselves, especially the former bird which is now almost common
in the scattered forest patches, and the Crows are reappearing in certain
localities.
The indigenous forest of New Zealand is magnificent, at least,
what there is left of it, for the hand of Man has dealt very hardly with
the vegetation of these Antipodean islands. Destruction is the watch-
word of the New Zealand farmer. To him the tree-fern, totara, the
mati, the kahikatea are blots on the landscape to be got rid of at any
cost. It is of no account if the blackberries, the thistle, ragwort, gorse,
etc., overrun his land. These are tolerated for they are exotics and
remind him of home but not the native bush, that must be got rid of
without delay. In fact it is possible to travel many miles and not see
a sign of any native vegetation. Everything is imported, the grass,
the trees, and even the weeds. Very soon the New Zealand forest will
exist no more except in a few Government reserves. In fact, one has
to travel miles and miles off the beaten track to see even a small remnant
of native forest.
It is beyond my power of words to describe the beauties of the native

forest which have been untouched by man. Great forest giants raise
their heads a hundred to two hundred feet above the mass to tree-ferns,
fuschias, giant mosses, and a hundred other forest trees. Hardly a
naked branch or trunk is visible for all are clothed in a luxuriant
garment of mosses, ferns, and lichens. Nowhere in the whole world do
ferns grow in such profusion or variety. Every forest giant is festooned
with lovely grey green lichen, climbing ferns, and huge forest creepers.
So dense is the undergrowth as to be absolutely impenetrable in some
parts, one's progress is counted not by the miles per hour but by the
hours per mile.
Everywhere is damp and dark and it seems to rain perpetually.
The luxuriant vegetation is no doubt due to the excessive rainfall.
The shades of green are wonderful; never have I seen such a range,
from the almost black of the crepe fern to the pale greenish white of
some of the lichens.
Very often the forests are destroyed wantonly, but sometimes
sawmills are established ; all the large timber is felled and gradually
the felling operations are extended until forest railways have to be
built extending sometimes twenty-five miles or so from the mills.
The finest specimens of the trees are felled ; some I have seen have
been fifteen feet through at the base and by counting the rings I have
ascertained that some must have been 750 years old, rivalling the famous
American " Redwoods " themselves.
When the choicest timber has been felled and taken away, with
a dog-in-the-manger attitude the rest of the forest is burnt. It is heart-
breaking to see the flames licking up the magnificent timber, the tree-
ferns, and the general undergrowth. Nothing is spared. On every hand
the devastation is appalling ; no battle-fields in Flanders ever looked
worse than the forest country through which the fire has passed.
And the tragedy of it is that most of the land which is now being burnt
is no good for settlement, being far too steep and precipitous. In a
few years it becomes like the arid mountainous regions of Arabia.
I once asked the manager of a large timber company who were burning
one of the most magnificent remnants of native forest left in the country
what was the need for such destruction. I was told that it was customary
to burn the forest after the big timber had been taken out!

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
Most New Zealanders seem to think that the native vegetation
is something to be ashamed of, to be burnt, to be got rid of at any
cost. On the most inaccessible mountains and hills, in the deepest
gullies, in fact in any place often absolutely useless for pasturage, the
forest is burnt off, after a few years a secondary growth will appear
only to be burnt off again and again ; sometimes after successive
burnings a few cabbage-trees or tree-ferns will struggle through but
these are not tolerated and the farmer is not satisfied until at last
the whole is covered up with 44 exotics ", such as bramble, gorse, and
other pests.
A barrister friend of mine tells me that arson is due to a strange
psychological complex in which the individual affected derives a kind
of Sadistic thrill in seeing the devouring flames. It seems to me that
the inhabitants of the rural districts of New Zealand are to a large
degree afflicted by this strange mental aberration.
One day perhaps New Zealanders will wake up and realize what
the destruction of the forests mean, not only to the bird life about
which they care very little, but in the gradual diminishing of the rainfall.
One sees the rain-clouds circling round the tops of the mountains
where patches of forest have been reluctantly left, usually owing to
disputes between the vendor and the prospective purchaser ; and
leaving untouched altogether the hills and mountains which have been
denuded of vegetation.
There are some districts which were once heavily forested and which
are now practically desert owing to the total destruction of the native
vegetation.
True, there are Government reserves but all round the spirit of
destruction is creeping in. The fires lighted by the farmers creep into
the reserves, cattle are allowed to run through the forests destroying
the wonderful undergrowth and in time causing the forest giants,
which must have their roots protected from the sun, to perish.
Old pioneers have told me of the awful slaughter of bird life as
the country was opened up. The Kakas (the large native Parrot),
the Fruit Pigeons, the Bitterns, the Parrakeets, Tuis, Bell-birds,
and, in fact, every living bird almost was killed on sight. If a man
had too many for his own use the rest were thrown away. On the

establishment of the cold storage houses in the cities, men would go
out and kill birds in hundreds, sending them to the refrigerators to be
brought out and used as required. Many people would send in several
months' supply at a time.
It is little wonder then that most of the larger New Zealand birds,
if not extinct are nearly so. Only a few of the endemic birds have been
able to hold their own against the advance of civilization. The Pipit,
the White-eyes, and the Purple Swamp Hen are about the only birds
which are seen in the vicinity of human habitations.
By the lovely Lake Waikaremoana, with its equally beautiful name,
" Little Ocean of Rippling Waters," which lies over two thousand
feet above sea-level, I found my heart's delight.
It was by these incomparable blue waters, surrounded by steep
mountains clothed to the water's edge with the most magnificent
virgin forest, that I first heard the chorus of Bell-birds and Tuis which
so charmed the early explorers and settlers and which is heard in so
few places to-day on the mainland.
To attempt to convey to the reader's mind but the slightest
impression of the grandeur of Lake Waikaremoana would be impossible.
Only those who have looked upon its beauties can realize that such
scenes are a reality and not the vivid imagination of an artistic mind.
To see the sun, as it sinks over the distant mountains, turn the
blue waters to pink and orange is a sight worth coming half round the
world to see. I thought that upon leaving the fair island of Dominica
I should never again see such an earthly paradise, but this surpassed
anything I had ever seen. Not only did the fascination he in the scenery
but it is one of the last refuges on the mainland of New Zealand's
much persecuted avifauna. Here within a few yards of the govern-
ment hostel one sees hosts of Tuis, Bell-birds, Tom-tits, Whiteheads,
and last but not least many of the magnificent Fruit Pigeons.
What a haven of refuge, what a feast to the tired eyes of the city
dweller. Upon arriving there one feels like a tired traveller who after
years of wandering has at last reached home.
Upon its placid waters flock, as soon as the shooting season starts,
hosts of persecuted waterfowl to find sanctuary in its forest-fringed
inlets, for the lake being so indented has nearly a hundred miles of

coast-line. On one morning alone, I was told, three hundred Black
Swans found refuge from their slayers.
Long may the remnant of New Zealand's unique avifauna find
a shelter from the ruthless world in its forest glades but, alas ! even
around this fair spot, settlement grows and timber companies obtain
leases to chop and burn the forest; the fires, through carelessness,
penetrate far into the protected areas---a good thing, say the New
Zealand farmers, to see such rubbish burnt, for to the average farmer
the magnificent forest is known as " rubbish ". It is difficult to imagine
the type of mind which would rather see thousands of acres of treeless
land enclosed with barbed wire fences than see the forest glades of
unsurpassing splendour as one sees them here.
Little Barrier Island is to the ornithologist visiting New Zealand,
what water is to the tired and thirsty traveller in the desert. This
wonderful island off the coast of New Zealand in the blue Pacific
Ocean is perhaps unique in the world. In the virgin forests which cover
the island from the sea-shore to the summits of the highest peaks
in the centre, some of the world's rarest birds find their last refuge.
Here species banished years ago from the mainland live out their lives
in the seclusion of the forest untouched and unafraid of man as they
did in the long distant ages before the Australasial regions were
discovered by the white races.
The New Zealand Government, as if to atone for the terrible massacre
of the bird life on the mainland have set aside--for all time let us hope
--this almost inaccessible island for the preservation of the native
birds. The proclaiming of this island as a sanctuary came only just
in time to save such vanishing species as the Stitch Bird, the North
Island Bobin, etc., for it was on Little Barrier, or to give it its Maori
name, Hauturu, meaning " the resting place of the winds ", that many
rapacious agents of skin collectors in Europe made their last attempt
to obtain skins of the vanishing New Zealand birds.
This race of collectors is fortunately dying out, in Europe at least.
These men were collectors of bird skins on the same lines as one collects
stamps, if a bird was rare or nearly extinct so much the better, there
was more joy in possessing the skin. Agents were sent to obtain the
last survivors of the race, for to them it mattered little if the birds

were exterminated so long as there were skins in cabinets. In fact,
many so-called ornithologists of the last century seemed secretly
glad when a bird became extinct if they possessed any skins of the
last of the species. And it is due to these people who used to call
themselves ornithologists that many of the world's rarest birds are
practically extinct to-day.
My stay on Little Barrier was an event in my ornithological career.
For years I had secretly wished to pay this interesting island a visit
and I little dreamt that my wish would one day materialize. For one
thing it is not easy to obtain permission to visit it and I hardly relished
making a prolonged stay on the island alone. Owing to the great
kindness of Mr. Rowland Hutchinson, the Honorary Secretary of the
Avicultural Society of New Zealand, all these difficulties were over-
come. So one blazing hot summer's day in January of this year (1933)
I set off from Auckland with my companion, also a member of the
Avicultural Society, and who, besides being a keen aviculturist, had
a very good knowledge of the native birds, so needless to say we had
a great deal in common.
After a day's journey up the coast we arrived at a tiny port where
we had to charter a launch to take us to the island. Unfortunately
owing to bad weather we were compelled to spend several days at the
hotel whose chief source of income seemed to be derived not from
visitors but from illicit drinking. At last we set sail in a launch
which seemed almost too frail to carry our enormous amount of
baggage.
What a thrill it was as we neared the island ! How immense it
.seemed as it loomed up through the mists, its great sinister-looking
peaks wreathed with floating masses of clouds, its deep green forests
reaching down from above the clouds to the edge of the impregnable
looking cliffs.
Instead of finding ourselves alone on this sub-tropical island, we
found it almost overcrowded ! There was the caretaker, his son and
wife and a friend, three students from a New Zealand college, and a
noted bird artist, a Miss Daff, whose pictures I hope will one day grace
the pages of this Magazine.
The island consists mainly of very precipitous razor-backed mountain

ridges, some being quite inaccessible owing to tbeir almost perpendicular
formation and the density of tbe vegetation. It rises up to 2,300 feet
in tbe centre of tbe island and all tbe ridges seem to converge at tbis
point. Tbe highest ridges are mainly covered with kauri forest. In
some parts tbe ridges are so narrow that it is almost difficult not to
overbalance and fall down either side !
There are two small areas of flat land where it is possible to land,
but for tbe main part tbe coast-bne consists of high perpendicular cliffs,
some a thousand feet high, whose bases are washed by tbe sea at high
tide. All along tbe foot of tbe chffs and often on tbe chffs themselves,
growing out at right angles right over tbe sea, are tbe beautiful
pobutukawa trees whose crimson flowers are a great attraction to all
tbe honey-sucking birds, and when tbe trees are in flower, flocks of
Bell-birds and Tuis can be seen regaling themselves on tbe nectar
from tbe crimson blossoms.
Other island sanctuaries were visited, including tbe Hen and Chicken
Islands, Kapiti Island (tbis beautiful island I reluctantly bad to leave
after a three days' stay owing to blood poisoning contracted in Fiji),
Stewart Island, etc., but tbe Little Barrier is certainly tbe gem
of them all.
Tbe following notes are not arranged in any scientific order but are
merely placed in tbe order as tbe birds were seen.
I was very fortunate in seeing nearly all tbe endemic land birds of
tbe North Island, but owing to being laid up with tbe blood poisoning
already mentioned I was unable to see a great deal of tbe South Island.
Though tbe destruction of tbe forest in tbe North Island is bad it is
not to be compared with that in tbe South Island. Tbe devastation
is beyond description. Hundreds of square miles of barren and desert
country with no sign of a single native plant or tree. One may drive
for a hundred miles or more and see not a single vestige of native
vegetation. Range upon range of mountains have been denuded of
tbeir forests and are now completely barren, reminding one of the
desert regions of tbe Sahara. It is almost unbebevable, tbe destruction
of native flora ; only in a few remote reserves does one see any native
trees, and all this has happened in tbe last sixty years or so. Tbe early
sheep farmers completed tbeir work to such an extent and with such

rapidity that the younger generation have no idea that the country
was forested at all.
The South Island of New Zealand reminds me of a woman with her
hair shorn off, for the wonderful vegetation was to New Zealand what
the hair is to a beautiful woman. No country in the world has been
spoiled to such an extent in so short a time. True there are forest
reserves but they are infinitesimal compared to the barren areas.
The native birds are exceedingly scarce. Imported birds abound,
Sparrows, Goldfinches, Redpoles by the thousand. There are rabbits
by the million.
The success of my trip through New Zealand was entirely due to
the kindness of Mr. Rowland Hutchinson, the Honorary Secretary
of the Avicultural Society of New Zealand, and also to other members
of the Society, who made me more than welcome and who made a
period of six months seem more like six weeks.
The New Zealand Scaup (Fuligula novceseelandice)
This jolly little duck appears to be nowhere plentiful on the North
Island and is found mainly on the clear inland lakes where I saw it
in pairs. It is exceedingly tame on the lakes of the North Island
sanctuaries, especially on the Lakes Waikaremoana and Waikare-iti,
where it is free from persecution.
It is much more plentiful on the lakes of the Southern Island
than anywhere else. Around the wharf at Queenstown there are several
small flocks absolutely tame and always waiting for bits of food thrown
to them by the tourists. The Scaup is a great diver and can be seen
swimming in the clear waters searching for food at the bottom of the
lakes. Often one of the large trout will be seen in attendance following
the duck and finding food in the mud disturbed by the bird. These
ducks have a habit of frequently lifting themselves out of the water
and exposing the light under parts.
Though by no means brightly coloured this bird has a very great
charm which is mainly accounted for by the rich browns and pleasing
shape and by its extreme tameness when not persecuted. In New
Zealand it is known as the Black Teal but is totally unlike a teal in

appearance. I saw several tame birds and very delightful pets they
make, and I know of no more charming addition to one's collection of
waterfowl.
I do not think that it has ever been imported into this country.
I had hopes of bringing some back but was disappointed at the last
minute, though I still have hopes of being able to get some.
The Rifleman (Acanthisitta choris)
I first made the acquaintance of this feathered mite in the dense
alpine scrub on the slopes of Mount Tongariro.
When wandering in search of birds near the snow-line almost at
the very limit of the vegetation, I came across a man who was working
on a new road, and in talking to him about the birds, he asked me if
I could tell him the name of a bird no larger than the first joint of his
thumb. I knew that this must be the Rifleman and sure enough in
a few minutes after leaving him one of these feathered sprites came
up within a foot or two of my face and chattered and scolded.
Afterwards I found them quite common up to the limit of the
vegetation on the mountain. Quite fearless and intensely inquisitive
they spend their time running up and down the trunks and limbs of
the lichen-covered trees in search of minute insects on which they
entirely subsist. Extremely active, they never rest for a minute except
when they come to examine a stranger in the " bush ". All the time
they utter a thin, shrill, scolding note.
In size these tiny creatures are about half the bulk of the English
Wren, but look larger than they really are because they usually keep
their feathers puffed out and their wings outspread.
The Rifleman does not seem so common in the low areas as in the
more mountainous regions. I found it excessively plentiful in the
beech forests of the North Island, ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 feet.
In the Waikaremoana forests it was very abundant between 2,500
and 3,000 feet, but I think it must make a migration to lower altitudes
in the winter time, for in those parts the cold is very severe and in mid-
winter there are several feet of snow.
The presence of the Rifleman can at once be detected by the shrill

high-pitched note which is uttered nearly all the time the bird is in
motion. This tiny bird has few enemies ; he is too quick and active
for cats, rats, weasels, or hawks, the entrance hole of his nest, which
is usually in a hollow tree near the ground, is so small that only this
tiny creature could possibly get inside. It was impossible even to get

So long as the beech forests remain in the higher altitudes this
tiny bird will continue plentiful.

This Starling is found in N.E. Africa, from Abyssinia to Tanganyika
Territory, where they are plentiful in small flocks. They have quite a
pleasing song, and are insectivorous and frugivorous and associate with
the green Glossy Starlings. I was nearly successful in rearing a young
one the year before last, in fact one young one was reared but was
killed the day he left the nest. This year I had a pair in one of my
large aviaries, and they built a nest inside the aviary shelter in a nest-
box about eight feet from the ground. The nest was built of leaves,
roots of grass, and mud. The first egg was laid on the 10th May.
Three eggs were laid, and, although the birds did not sit very well, two
young were hatched out by the 26th May. One young one was found
dead on the 1st June, but the other one was successfully reared, leaving
the nest on the 20th June. The hen bird did most of the feeding, and
from the 26th June the young bird fed himself. The old birds started
building again the day the young left the nest. When feeding their
young the old birds had the habit of attacking anyone who went into
the aviary, usually from behind, catching one on the head or neck.

By the Rev. J. E. Sweetnam, Vicar of Taunton
The annual migration of members, and consequent dearth of copy
at this time of the year, may perhaps attach some fictitious value to
notes from one whose enthusiasm is perforce restrained by considerations
of time and space.
At the moment I have four aviaries in use, one being merely a spare
room in a disused part of this old Vicarage, adapted by the addition
of a flight fixed on the outside of one of the windows. It is used chiefly
as winter quarters for the less hardy species. Another is quite a small
affair with double flight, fitted with small trap doors, and now containing
pairs of green Glossy Starlings (Laprocolius chalybeus) and Pekin
Robins. The former have been playing at nesting since May, but the
Pekins look like qualifying for release by nesting in earnest at last.
As the Starlings are very tame and undoubtedly a true pair they have
been a disappointment due, I imagine, to the fact that the releasing
aviary is too small to give them a fair chance. I have had an odd bird
of this species flying loose before and intend releasing this pair shortly,
whether nesting or not.
Once a pair of these intelligent and confiding birds can be induced
to nest in an aviary they may be safely released, and young Glossies
are most easily bred in this way but, given a large planted aviary, they
should not be difficult. The chief trouble with them is to secure a true
pair as there is no external distinction and both sexes sing, though
the hen has a more raucous voice.
Birds in the other aviaries include a cock Virginian Cardinal--a
bachelor from choice, since he murdered his intended wife in cold

blood last week--and a beautiful cock Indigo Bunting whose celibacy
is due to failure to secure a wife for him. As a Bunting he should be
partly insectivorous, but I have never known him touch anything
other than seed. My modest collection includes also a pair of Crimson-
winged Waxbills (so called, but in both appearance and habits they
more nearly resemble Finches) now nesting, pairs of Alario, White-
throated and Guttural Finches, Black-headed Siskins, three or four
pairs of Diamond Doves, and numerous small fry such as Java Sparrows,
Zebra Finches, Bengalee, and Silverbills. There are also some coloured
Canaries, acock Algerian Chaffinch which, mated to a British hen,
produced, but did not fully rear young in June ; and numerous
other British species which have already produced several mules and
hybrids, more remarkable for their vitality than their rarity.
A Chestnut-breasted X Bengalee hybrid which only lived for a
few days might have been saved had I had a true pair of Bengalee
available at the time.
My records to date (30th July) show a total of sixty-five young
reared but, as usual, the majority of these are " small fry ", and the
season has, so far, been disappointing.
I would advise anyone who can do so to procure a pair of Black-
headed Siskins--delightful little birds and persistent breeders. My
only pair are again nesting, undeterred by the fact that their first
clutch was unfertile and, for some unknown reason, the four apparently
strong young in the second nest only survived a week. If they are
more successful this time I hope to contribute some detailed notes
about the nesting habits of this species, of which I can find no such
record. From the day the first egg is laid the hen never seems to leave
the nest, being assiduously fed by the cock who, not content with
this, is ready to assist in the rearing of any other young birds in the
aviary. Though not a very brilliantly coloured bird, his constant
activity and the contrast of black head with yellow body makes him
always conspicuous in an aviary.
I owe an apology to Zebra Finches for the bad character I gave
them in some recent notes in the Magazine. Since then my four pairs
have been exemplary, producing young with a regularity hardly
surpassed even by Silverbills--which latter increase so quickly that one

360 J. E. Sweetnam--Some Notes from a Somerset Aviary
can hardly give them away. The cock of one of my two adult pairs is of
the Indian, and the hen the African variety, about half the young
having the characteristics of each parent and being indistinguishable
from pure-bred birds.
Though stupid and rather uninteresting, I find Diamond Doves most
prolific and excellent " seed providers ". I reckon on obtaining an
average of one pair of young per month from each pair from March to
September, but this applies only to fully adult pairs, young birds being
uncertain during the early months of their first season. For the benefit
of any who may not have discovered it it may be worth mentioning
opinion, almost essential to success in breeding this species. Indeed,
some pairs seem to feed their young almost entirely on it.
I remember reading that someone--I think it was our President--
had bred Diamond Doves freely by keeping several pairs in the same
aviary. If so, it must have been an exceptionally large one as, in my
experience with them, even two cocks in an ordinary sized aviary
spend their time trying to murder each other, with disastrous results to
all breeding operations. Mine are no trouble at all to feed but are so
prolific that eggs laid immediately after, and often before, the young
leave the nest must be removed. Otherwise the parents devote their
attention to the destruction of the first pair. When this occurs the
unwanted young can be easily hand-reared on nothing but milk until
old enough to peck maw for themselves.
An alternative to removing the eggs is the removal of the cock
before the young leave the nest, when the hen will manage the feeding
of both nestlings. Last season I had no less than twenty-three young
from two adult pairs, and I have already had almost that number
from three pairs this season.
As they are entirely harmless with all other birds I generally keep
one pair in each hardbill aviary where, apart from the addition of
maw, they require no special treatment of any kind.
After Diamond Doves and Zebra Finches I find Java Sparrows the
best seed providers, and no birds could be less trouble to feed and
breed--the young seeming to turn up from nowhere. In my experience
the percentage of fertile eggs is considerably greater when pure whites

are mated to greys, though, of course, this means a number of grey
and pied young.
That I have had no success with Spermophike this season may be
due to the fact that what, apart from a yellow bill, looked for all the
world like a hen White-throated Finch has turned out to be a cock of
some sort--either an immature White-throated or some allied species
with which I am not familiar.
These notes have already amply justified the title in so far as
desultoriness is concerned. The following incident may have some
bearing on the length of this article, even if it has none whatever on
aviculture !
Among the many old customs associated with this Church is that
of distributing numerous loaves of bread on 1st May. The terms of
the old charity decree that the Vicar shall preach a sermon to those
assembled at the prescribed service, and shall receive the sum of five
shillings " for his pains With the enthusiasm of a newly-appointed
Vicar I availed myself of the first such opportunity to speak at even
greater length than I have here written. When the loaf-laden congrega-
tion had dispersed I said to my Curate, " well, I think I have earned
my five shillings." To which, he, with an asperity perhaps pardonable
in one who had had to listen to the homily without receiving even a
loaf, replied, " I think the people have earned their bread."

This most amusing Duck was described by me in the Magazine in
1931, on page 349, when they bred with me, but the young were not
reared. This year early in April I accidentally found a nest on the
island of the small Duck pond in the enclosure. Hearing some hissing,
we looked to see where the sound came from, when we suddenly

disturbed. The nest was a very high one, and the birds kept adding
to it each time we saw it. Two of the three eggs were hatched out, but
one of the young was found dead just outside the nest. The other
one was swimming along gaily with its parents and was the funniest
little thing I have ever seen. As soon as it saw any of us it dived
and kept under water for quite a long time. The parents took great
care of the baby, swimming on either side of it, and no other Duck
on the pond was allowed to get anywhere near it. The birds were given
plenty of duck weed and gentles, and in a few days the young one
was tame enough to come and feed with the parents. By the middle
of June it was impossible to know the young one from its parents.
The old birds are sitting again, and I hope some more young will be
reared. I am delighted at my success in rearing this amusing little
Duck, especially as my pond is hardly a suitable one for breeding rare
Duck, being very small and overcrowded by several species of Duck.
As far as I know, this bird has never been bred in captivity before.
12th July. This morning five beautiful young ones were seen on
the pond, being well guarded by the parents.
THE BREEDING OF THE SPURWING GOOSE
The African Spurwing Goose (Plectmpterus gambensis) is a large
and handsome species with metallic black and white plumage, pink
feet, and spurs on the wings. It is not often kept in collections of
waterfowl because it is spiteful towards other birds unless allowed
plenty of liberty. In the London Zoological Gardens it has been
somewhat out of place and generally regarded as rather a nuisance, and
no attempt has it ever made to reproduce its species. In fact, no
records of its breeding in captivity seem to exist, though it has produced
hybrids with the Egyptian Goose and the Upland Goose. An example
of the latter hybrid was bred in the Clifton Zoo a few years ago and,
I believe, is still there.
As the accommodation at the London Gardens was too limited for
these large birds a pair that had lived there for a number of years was
transferred to Whipsnade when the Zoological Park there was formed

some three or four years ago. Here they made themselves at home
at once, becoming extremely tame and wandering to considerable
distances. Every afternoon at precisely the same time of day they
would pay a visit to the Head Keeper's lodge, where they knew they
were sure of some special dainty. In fact there, with almost unlimited
space to range over, they proved attractive and very intelligent birds,
but they made no attempt to breed until this year, when, in June,
the female completely disappeared and it was feared that some
prowling fox had taken her. However, she was eventually found,
half a mile away from the pond on which the pair were wont to reside,
in a thick belt of bushes sitting tightly upon ten eggs. Fearing that
a fox might take her, the Head Keeper spread a trail of creosote
in a wide circle round the nest and in the centre of this she went on
sitting. She hatched all ten eggs and appeared one morning on her
accustomed pond, a half mile trail, with her brood. To reach the
pond she had to cross a paddock in which was a pair of Sarus Cranes
with their chick, and at such times these Cranes are dangerous. The
Cranes attacked, but the plucky goose put up such a good defence
that they could get nowhere near the chicks, and finally she took the
offensive and drove the Cranes right away.
The first evening after hatching the Goose returned to her nest,
another half-mile tramp, with her brood and there they spent the night.
Spurwinged Geese are very distinct from the usual run of Geese
and they remind one somewhat of huge Tree Ducks, while their goslings
are much more like Ducks than Geese. In fact, they are almost
indistinguishable from Mallard ducklings, though, of course, somewhat
larger than these at the same age.
M. Delacour's description of these Geese in Aviculture (Vol. II)
hardly does them justice ; he calls them " ugly and clumsily built,
very spiteful, and very susceptible to cold ". They appear neither
ugly nor clumsily built when seen in the right setting, that is a large
open space, neither do they appear spiteful when given sufficient room,
and as for their delicacy, well, when first imported doubtless they need
care, but Whipsnade is as cold as most places in England and there
they have not suffered in the open for the last four years.

THE KESTON FOREIGN BIRD FARM :
A SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT
By David Seth-Smith
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99422528125" page_id="56237586"  page_num="364" year="" vol="">
Messrs. Boosey and Brooksbank's experiment in forming a foreign
bird farm kas interested me greatly from the start, for in my young
days I built a castle in the air which consisted of a farm ; but it was
no ordinary farm, its most interesting and most profitable branch was
the breeding of foreign birds. My castle was never more than in the
air, for the considered verdict of the Powers that were was to the
effect that, desirable as were hobbies, it would be a fatal mistake to
dream of turning one's hobby into one's career. Hobbies, I was told,
were excellent for those who had time or leisure to indulge in them,
but for the majority the thing was to keep one's nose to the grindstone
until one was old and infirm, when one would be able to revert to the
hobbies of one's youth. So, had I had my way, I am not sure that the
Keston Foreign Bird Farm would have been, as it is, the first of its
kind ! As it is, to watch its progress and be able to very heartily
congratulate its founders is a great joy. Here are two young men,
both keen naturalists and bird lovers, who left other careers because
they believed that their favourite hobby could be ridden to success.
The one was born to an important position in the music world, his
father being head of the famous old publishing house which bears his
name ; the other was on the stage, with every prospect of a successful
career. But the fascination of keeping and breeding foreign birds
was strong, and, after all, why should it not be made to pay and pay
well ? So, in the face of strong opposition, they joined hands and took
the plunge, and have never regretted it, for they have proved that
&amp;quot;they were right.
The Keston Foreign Bird Farm is an undoubted success. I visited
it two years ago, and was much impressed by what I saw. I have now
visited it again, and the way it has progressed in the interval is
astonishing. The number of aviaries has doubled, and it is very
evident that its owners know their job right well and can now be sure
of producing each year a numerous healthy crop of young birds of
kinds that are most sought after by aviculturists. They are especially

successful with the rarer species of Parrakeets, and only dispose of
those actually bred on the farm.
The farm is situated on a sloping hillside facing south, and sheltered
from the north by a wood. Aviaries for the Parrakeets are arranged
in rows on terraces. There are forty-six of these, and there is sufficient
space to allow of each one being moved, backwards or forwards, so
that the same ground is not occupied two years running. At first sight
some of these aviaries strike one as being on the small side, but

experience has shown that they are just the right size for their purpose,
neither too small or too large, and the proof that they are right is
shown by the number of first-rate young birds that are reared in them.
They are made secure from rats by having small-mesh wire netting
floors, and a great point is that human beings do not enter, the birds
being attended to from the outside and so are never frightened.
The list of birds bred this season is an imposing one ; it consists

hybrids between a cock Red-rump and a hen Hooded Parrakeet.
I have mentioned only the aviaries for the rarer Parrakeets ; there
are no less than 200 other aviaries for Budgerigars, Finches, Waxbills,
etc., and in these have been reared this year Red- and Black-headed
Gouldians, Bichenos and Ringed Finches, Rufous-tails, Green
Avadavats and Silver-bills, Long-tailed, Hecks and Masked Grass-
finches ; Cherry Finches and Bengalese. The lastof these prove very
valuable foster-parents for other Finches, a fact which has led to the
construction of a special Bengalese House, a most useful structure
containing rows of &apos;metal cages, each housing a pair of Bengalese
busily engaged in incubating eggs or rearing young, perhaps their own,
but more likely those of some rarer Finch or Waxbill.
Budgerigar enthusiasts will find at Keston some of the best examples
of the various coloured varieties. There are some 2,000 Budgerigars
on the farm, and those that took my fancy most were some Yellows of
a wonderful hue--lovely golden birds, with not the faintest trace of
green in their plumage.
But when one has seen all these aviaries, with their varied and
rare occupants, there is still the most interesting house of all to
inspect--the Acclimasition House, a brick building some 36 by 30 ft.,
lighted by skylights fitted with Vita-glass, and warmed in winter by
a very modern type of radiator, heated by an anthracite stove which
is thermostatically controlled. This house contains five aisles, each
6 by 30 ft., and has room for 100 cages which are 2 ft. 6 in. by 2 ft.
by 1 ft. 6 in. These are of metal, and any two can, by moving
a partition, be thrown into one, making a cage 5 feet long, which
is very useful for such birds as Parrakeets.
Owing to the Parrot ban the Keston Foreign Bird Farm are, of
course, precluded from selling any but British-bred Parrots, but
this does not apply to the Finches and Waxbills. These have
a nasty way of dying when newly imported, and there is a demand
for acclimatised specimens. This is being met by a careful system of
acclimatising. The Acclimatising House and a series of aviaries are

made full use of in this, and the Keston Farm is able to guarantee
that only birds thoroughly used to the vagaries of the English
climate are offered for sale by them. The price of these is necessarily
higher than for newly-imported birds, but there is far less risk of
their dying.
I have not room to mention all the birds I saw at Keston, but must
record the presence there of a very perfect pair of the Yellow-fronted
New Zealand Parrakeet (Cyanorhamphus auriceps), perhaps the rarest
birds in the collection, and I think there is every chance of their
breeding.

We welcome the appearance of Mr. J. C. Laidlay's new book because
the various species of Waterfowl are very popular with those fortunate
enough to have the necessary facilities for keeping them properly.
They are delightful birds, hardy, and very ornamental, and it is not
necessary to have enormous stretches of water in order to keep them ;
quite small ponds are all they require. In fact, we have known a pair
of Carolinas not only to thrive but to rear a brood in an enclosure of
some 20 feet square containing a pond of less than 6 feet in
diameter !
Mr. Laidlay has had a life-long experience of keeping and breeding
all kinds of Ornamental Ducks and Geese, and no one was better
fitted to write a book on the subject. His book deals with more than
a hundred species, of each of which a short description is given and,
where known, the period of incubation, and there are no less than sixty-
eight photographic illustrations, all taken from life. We wish it had
been found possible to enlarge the account of each species by details
of its wild life where this is known, and more precise details of the
habitat. To give this as " Africa " or " Australia " is somewhat vague !

The chapters at the end of the book will be found of the utmost
value to all who wish to keep and breed Ornamental Waterfowl, for
in these the author gives precise details of how it should be done.
These chapters are headed: " Broody hens and their management,"
" Buying birds and their treatment on arrival," "Feeding and manage-
ment of adult Duck," " Eggs and fertility," " Management of young,"
" In the rearing field," and " The Duck as the mother ".
The photographic illustrations, which are whole-page plates, will
be found a great help in identifying the species, though in the first
one, " Pair of Red Flamingoes," it should have been stated that these
are young birds in immature plumage.

It would appear from Mr. Debono's letter that the Barbary Partridge
has the same habit as the Cretan Chukor. Two lots of eggs are laid, the cock
taking charge of one and the hen of the other, the broods being reared
separately. It seems also that, having got his batch of eggs, the cock resents
the company of his mate: possibly she irritates him with unwanted advice

\ The Blue or Mountain Duck (Hymenolaimus malacorhynchus)
One of my disappointments in New Zealand was not seeing this
strange .and very rare, aberrant duck. I tracked it down to one of
its few remaining resorts, the Whakapapanui Biver on Mount Tongariro.
I searched in vain for this illusive creature, wandering far up the river
almost to the snow line and was rewarded only by finding a few
feathers. I was told by a road man that birds had been seen flying
upstream a few days before my arrival.
This very distinct duck is found only on the fastest flowing streams
\0x25A0 and torrents which flow through the mountain forest and never
j frequents the low forest lands or the still open waters.
Never very common, this bird has become very rare, chiefly on
account of its tameness and lack of fear of man.
My hopes ran high of seeing this bird when one of the employees
.at the Chateau Tongariro told me that he had found a nest of eight
; young ones, but on his taking me to the spot I found that the supposed
I nest was only a shelter where the young ones had gone when frightened
by the man.
There was no doubt that the birds were there, for they were seen

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
and heard by several people whilst I was at the Chateau. But though
I wandered miles up and down the stream, a no easy matter when the
banks were steep and covered with the densest alpine forest to the
water's edge, I was never lucky enough to see the birds.
This duck possesses remarkable swimming powers. It can strike
upstream against a current which would sweep a man off his feet.
If the bird could keep at the high altitudes where it nests, all the
year round, it would be safe, but in these districts the cold in the
winter is intense ; snow covers the ground, the rivers often freeze over.
The birds are then forced to lower altitudes and come within range of
the duck-shooters who, although the bird is protected, neither know
nor care at what species they aim. To them a duck is a duck, whether
it is blue, black, or yellow.
I was told by some gold prospectors that the bird was occasionally
seen in the Sounds district in the south-west corner of the South
Island, but that it was far from plentiful and was being exterminated
by the various introduced mammals, such as cats, rats and weasels,
which now abound in the district.
According to all accounts this bird will eventually become extinct,
its extreme tameness has been its undoing, neither can it cope with
the altered conditions. It is not found on any of the island sanctuaries
or it might have been saved for posterity. I doubt whether it would
be possible to keep this species in captivity.&apos; I don't think that it
has even been exported from New Zealand.
The bird is distinguished from all other ducks by its blue-grey
plumage and its extraordinary bill. The end of the upper mandible
is semi-circular and has a flap of loose skin which hangs over the lower
part. This is no doubt of great use to the bird in obtaining its food
from the bottoms of the fast-flowing streams.
The Tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae)
After the Kiwi, the Tui is perhaps the most famous of all New
Zealand birds. The first question one is asked when it is known that
one is interested in birds is, "Ah, have you heard the Tui ?
A certain bird book recently published states that the Tui is common
throughout New Zealand. From my own observations and from

those of others this unfortunately is not the case. Everyone in New
Zealand knows of the Tui, for its fame is almost legendary, but very
few town dwellers or members of the younger generation have seen
it unless they live in remote districts.
It was my great desire to see these famous birds as soon as I arrived
in New Zealand, but to do so I had to travel many miles off the beaten
track into the virgin bush. In fact to get the first glimpse of this
bird I had to go nearly twenty miles into the mountains from a tiny
township called Mananui (meaning, " the place of many birds "). We
travelled up in the early mornings ona" jigger ", an ingenious machine
consisting of an ancient motor cycle with four truck wheels fastened
on to enable it to run on the lines up to the timber-felling camp.
The first day we journeyed up in the pouring rain, almost frozen with
cold, and that was in midsummer ! At length, after many hours in
the dripping forest, we heard the loud ringing notes of a Tui and soon
afterwards saw him perched on the topmost branch of a high forest
tree, his " pois " were very conspicuous, he continued to call for a time
but later we lost him.
In the days following we saw quite a few, but never more than
three or four at a time. Usually they were more often heard than seen.
Once we were lucky enough to see two males displaying to a female.
There was a terrible commotion as the birds dashed about the branches.
They seemed quite regardless of our presence. The two males jumped
about with the greatest energy, their body feathers puffed out, until
they appeared nearly twice their natural size, all the time their
" pois " standing out very plainly against the deep shining plumage.
They danced and sang in an exceedingly noisy and clumsy way until
the hen moved off, followed by her two suitors.
People go into raptures over the song of this bird, but to my mind
it is greatly over-rated. It is certainly very loud, much louder and
stronger in volume than any other bird I know, but it is by no means
sweet like the song of the skylark.
Both the song of the Tui and the way it is delivered are remarkable.
The loud rich notes are poured out with much gesticulating and
reaching ; one would almost think that the bird had a bone in its
throat that it was trying to get rid of.

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
Whilst in Stewart Island, Tuis often came and sang quite close to
me when sitting in the forest, sometimes within a foot or two of my
face. It is only when close to the bird that one hears the flow of soft
bubbling notes which are lost when one is a distance away. Though
there are many loud clear musical notes, they are not continuous
and the whole flow of melody is spoilt by the harsh coughing and
choking notes with which it intersperses its song.
In certain forested districts such as the remote Government reserves
the birds are comparatively numerous and when unmolested become
the most conspicuous birds about the district. They are always in
evidence, dashing about all over the place with a noisy, blustering
motion. The sound made by the wings when flying is remarkable
and resembles a loud rustling of silk, and it can be heard from a
considerable distance. Every few minutes as they move from tree to
tree they stop to utter a few melodious notes which, when heard from
several birds at once and in conjunction with the Bellbirds, make quite
an enchanting melody, but when heard singly the song lacks the
musical qualities generally attributed to it.
To question the Tuis' musical powers ranks almost as blasphemy
in New Zealand. He calls his loudest in the very early mornings and
many times about dawn I have been awakened by an almost deafening
chorus of these birds, a rare thing in New Zealand in these days.
When seeking refuge from the angry seas in some of the quiet
inlets of Stewart Island, we heard the chorus of Bellbirds and Tuis
which floated over the still waters from the forests, such as Captain
Cook must have heard when he first anchored in some of the then
beautiful inlets on the coast of New Zealand and which he speaks
about in his journals.
A great deal of sentimental stuff is written about the Tui such as,
the following from a recent novel, " There was a sudden whir of wings,
a flash of blue and white, and a Tui darted through the branches
up to the topmost twig of the tallest tree. Swaying gently, he droned
a few gutteral notes, then broke into a torrent of joyous song and as
though at a signal the forest woke to animation and music. A moment
of wild harmony and then as suddenly as it started the vocal melody
subsided." I only quote this to show the traditional attitude towards

the Tui's song which is similar to the one with regard to the nightingale
in England. It is a strange thing that though the skylark is very
plentiful in New Zealand its song remains unnoticed. Yet the most
wonderful bird melody I have ever heard was from a chorus of skylarks
in New Zealand. We lay anchored in the Bay of Whangarei. We
rose early, weighing anchor at about 4 a.m. on the most perfect summer's
morning ; the water was as still as glass, and not a single sound was
heard. Then the sky began to flush with the faintest pink of the
early dawn, and suddenly a skylark mounted into the still clear air
and poured forth his sweet melody, then another and another until at
last there must have been literally hundreds. In the stillness of that
early dawn they formed the most wonderful avian chorus I have ever
heard or ever expect to hear again. Things like that only happen once
in one's life-time.
On the Little Barrier Island the Tui, if not the commonest bird, is
at least the most conspicuous. It is seen and heard everywhere and
they seem in a great degree to consort with the Bellbirds, but this is
no doubt owing to their food supply being the same.
The old and knarled Pohutukawa trees which spread their crimson
laden branches over the waters of the blue Pacific, were almost alive
with both Tuis and Bellbirds in the blossoming season and although
there was a great deal of quarrelling between individuals of each
species one never saw the different species attack each other.
Around the caretaker's house the Tuis and the Bellbirds as well
were very tame. One could stand within two or three feet of them and
watch them feed on the plate of porridge that was placed outside every
morning. The Tuis never fought the Bellbirds, though the latter
very wisely gave way to them at all times, no doubt owing to their
superior size.
When at the Barrier in January we saw a great many young birds
only recently left the nest. These resemble young Blackbirds with
a greyish collar on the back of the neck.
The Tui has wonderful powers of flight and it was always a great
treat to watch these birds indulging in their amazing aerial gymnastics.
The birds mount to a great height in the air and suddenly come down
with a terrific rush like a meteor falling to earth.

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
The bird, which is similar in shape to a Blackbird though con-
siderably larger, is metallic blue-black in colour, bronzy on the back
and metallic blue on the wings and tail. On the back of the neck is
a broad collar of hackle-shaped feathers and on the throat are two
very striking plumes of white curled feathers which resemble little
white balls similar to those used by the Maoris in their Poi-dance hence
the name " Poi-bird."
The Tui is most pugnacious and blustering in its demeanour. It
passes through the forests with a great deal of noise but with incredible
swiftness. It reminds me of a man, who, full of his own importance,
bustles about with a great deal of noise but who really does nothing at
all. Very few other birds dare stand up to a Tui and when they are
very much in evidence most other birds except the Bellbirds keep out
of the road.
Had not the Tui been given the protection of the Law, it would have
vanished long ago, for it was esteemed by the European and Maori
alike, by the former for pies and the latter for potting down
for winter use.
The food of the Tui consists mainly of the nectar of flowers, small
insects and berries, and when not engaged in sucking the honey
from the flowers with their long forked tongues, they can be seen
searching for insects in the bunches of leaves at the end of the
branches.
When the beautiful yellow kowhais are in bloom, one can be almost
sure of seeing several of these birds extracting the nectar from the
brilliant golden blossoms. These trees are a very great attraction and
the birds will often come miles to visit them, often forsaking the forests
and coming close to human habitations.
The Tui often mimics various other birds' songs and also noises, in
fact it has the reputation of being able to imitate the human voice,
but this I very much doubt. Many times I have tracked down a new
bird as I thought by its song, only to find that it was a Tui. When on
Little Barrier Island, we were puzzled by a mysterious bird which
used to sing after dark, in a tree near our camp. Its song was totally
unlike any other we had heard. It remained a mystery until after
careful watching we found it to be a Tui.

That a bird with such a marked individuality as this one would
make a delightful pet goes without saying, but few are the people
within recent years who have kept one. Many years ago it was
occasionally imported into England but no one seemed to be able to
keep them long ; that was in the days before the feeding of honey-
eating birds was understood. But now we have the food, the birds
have gone and never again shall we see them in our aviaries, for so
strict are the laws relating to the bird life in New Zealand that it is
an offence even to possess one of these birds, let alone export one.
Within recent years, I will not say how long ago, I possessed a single
example of one of these charming birds. It came to us a poor dejected
creature, there being no indication of the beauty that was later to
develop. It was a very young one and looked much like a very
bedraggled Blackbird, but with careful nursing he came round and
developed into one of the most charming pets I have ever possessed.
He lived upon the ordinary sunbird food, that is, Mellin's, Nestles',
and honey. We also hung a tiny meat safe, made out of wire netting
in his aviary which contained rather over-ripe meat and was a great
attraction to the flies which he loved ; once a winged insect found its
way into his aviary it never got out again. In spite of his size he was
the most agile bird I have ever possessed. He moulted into the most
perfect adult plumage complete with " pois ". He did not sing so
much his own song as imitate the calls and notes of other birds. His
special delight was in imitating the call of a Lesser Bird of Paradise.
This was not at all pleasing, for the loud ear-splitting " wak, wak,
wak " of Paradisea minor is anything but musical.
One day I was watching him and admiring his lovely plumage
when suddenly he fell dead. I could hardly realize what had happened ;
one minute he was full of life and vigour and the next a lifeless corpse.
A post-mortem showed that he was in perfect condition, no vestige of
disease. This was during a very hot summer and I think it must have
been sunstroke, for I did not realize then that the Tui was an inhabitant
of the deep leafy forests and shunned the bright sunlight. Had I
known that, he might still have been gracing my aviaries. So ended
the short life of one of the most interesting birds I have ever owned
and perhaps the last that will ever be seen in this country.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Neic Zealand Birds
Bellbird (Anthornis melanura)
This is another songster which is rather over-rated. Its notes are
very much like those of the Tui though it lacks the harsh coughing
notes that the latter bird puts into its song. But the resemblance
to bells is very remote unless they may be likened to the clang of a
cow bell. But possibly I am no criterion for my ear is more attuned
to the softer and more continuous song of the European birds.
This bird, like its congenor is far from common over most part of
the main land, but in the remote forested areas it is as plentiful as the
Tui, but is not nearly as conspicuous as that bird, keeping more to the
interior of the forest.
In the manuka scrub around our camp on the Little Barrier Island
these birds swarmed. All day long from the first indication of the dawn
until well into the dark we heard the loud and melodious calls of these
honey-eaters as they searched for insects or sucked the honey from the
nectar-bearing flowers. There was a family of young ones in the
bushes which overhung our camp and all day long we heard the sharp
metallic note of the young ones as they called for food.
We tamed this family by fastening soaked figs and sardine tins
of diluted condensed milk on the nearby branches. First the young
ones came and then the female. Eventually they became so tame that
we could pick them up or they would hop on to our hands if we held
them near the food, I cherished a great affection for the little hen.
She was the very essence of motherhood, and her one great concern
was the care of her babies. She rather mistrusted us at first and I am
sure it was a great relief to her to find that we meant no harm to her
charges. Her whole attitude was of the utmost anxiety that the young
ones got enough food. She never for a second rested. It was ludicrous
to see the youngsters feeding on the figs until the mother came when
they clamoured for food. She fed them upon what she had brought
and then started to feed them on the fig. While she was there they
never helped themselves.
I once witnessed a very interesting little incident. The little mother
brought a large cicada and started to show one of the young ones
how to break it up. She hammered it about on the branch for a time,
then handed it to the youngster, who in a clumsy way tried to do the

same. She snatched it back, hammered it again and passed it back,
the young one now started to drop it but the little hen was ready
and caught it before it fell to the earth. Every time he dropped it
she passed it back and immediately got into position for catching it
again by hanging head downwards underneath him until in time she
caught it almost as soon as it was level with her beak. Finally he got
it down his throat.
I never saw her mate. Evidently like some humans he thought
that domestic duties quite out of his sphere.
Bellbirds are extremely pugnacious. Even in the young ones this
instinct develops at a very early stage. The young ones around our
tent fought furiously amongst themselves especially when the female
was feeding them. Eventually other Bellbirds came around, being
attracted to the food, but they were furiously attacked and driven off
by the youngsters who seemed to think that this was solely their own
preserve.
So hard did the little mother work to rear her offspring that she
had no time for any toilet and her plumage became very frayed and
worn. I often think of her and wonder if she is still doing her best
to swell the population of Anthornis melanura on Little Barrier. If
she is, her efforts will not be in vain, for on that enchanted island the
feathered inhabitants have few enemies.
Around the caretaker's house the birds were in hundreds and
absolutely without fear. I have never seen such tame and confiding
birds. If I lived there I should never want a bird in a cage, there
would be no need. One could watch them licking up the nectar from
fuchsia flowers within a foot or two. One could sit on the door-step
(such things are done by respectable people in New Zealand) of the
house and see within range of a few feet, Bellbirds, Tuis, Fruit Pigeons,
Parrakeets, Cuckoos and other birds with no fear of man and going
about their occupations as though one didn't exist.
In the mornings a plate of sweetened porridge was placed outside
the door on a box and for an hour or so until it was finished there was
a continual stream of birds, sometimes there would be a dozen or so,
but usually less, for the adult males were very quarrelsome, driving off
all other birds especially the young ones. In fact so determined were

the males to get rid of the young birds that they chased them for
long distances until they were out of the vicinity.
So tame were the birds that one could sometimes go up and stroke
them whilst they were feeding. Once one ran up the stick I was holding
and examined between my fingers. Its intentions were hardly
complimentary ! The Bellbirds of Little Barrier Island were certainly
the tamest wild birds I have ever come across. I was shown a
photograph of the late caretaker's wife, holding a bowl of nectar, the
birds were perching on the rim of the bowl, also on the hands, arms,
and shoulders of the lady.
Whenever a Tui came down to the porridge plate, the Bellbirds
at once gave way and offered no resistance. They seemed seldom
to leave the vicinity of the house ; they could be seen on the doorstep,
in the outhouses, or examining the contents of any bucket or tin left
about. With a little patience I am sure the birds could have been
induced to come into the house and feed from the table.
These birds are very keen on bathing, and almost as soon as one
had finished at the porridge, it would fly up to the spouting on one of
the outhouses and have a thorough bath.
This is one of the few species of New Zealand birds which seems to
have taken a new lease of life during the past twenty or thirty years
or so. In the '90's of the last century it seemed to disappear from
most districts and naturalists thought at that time that a few more
years would see its total extinction, but fortunately they were wrong.
Why and how it came back no one seems to know ; possibly it developed
an immunity to the diseases of the imported birds, for now in certain
spots it is common, especially in Stewart Island and in some parts of
the South Island. Many years ago the Bellbird was imported into
this country fairly frequently but it must be now between forty and
fifty years since this sweet songster was seen in the aviaries of British
aviculturists and like the Tui I doubt whether it will ever be seen
again, for like that bird it is strictly protected.
I saw one or two in captivity in New Zealand which were in perfect
condition and I was told of some one who had bred them to the third
generation. They are quite easy to keep, feeding upon the usual
sunbird nectar, insects, and berries.

The Marquess of Tavistock--Breeding Notes for 1933 379
The Bellbird is about six inches in length and of a general olive
green, the wings and tail darkish, the head glossy purple-black. There
are bright yellow pectoral tufts which seem to be never exposed. The
iris is bright ruby red.
The extinction of this bird is very unlikely now that they have
become re-established in the forested areas and while the various
islands where it is common are kept as sanctuaries. I could say a
great deal more about this charming bird but space forbids. Both
the Bellbird and the Tui seem such an intrinsic part of the life of New
Zealand that I can never think of that far distant country without
seeing in my mind's eye the forms of these two sweet songsters.

By The Marquess of Tavistock
1933 has been, on the whole, rather a disappointing season, the
number of young birds reared being considerably below the output
of 1932. This was partly due to an unusually large number of reliable
breeding pairs coming to an untimely end between the conclusion of
last season and the beginning of this one. The cock Yellow-rump,
after years of wedded bliss resulting in additions to the population of
anything up to nine young per annum, suddenly fell upon his wife and
inflicted injuries which eventually led to her death. Neither was this
the only domestic tragedy. A hen lutinistic Plumhead, paired to
a green and yellow cock, always wants to nest far too early in the year
at a time which would give her very delicate young no chance of
survival. From the end of February she had been biting the wood
in every corner she could find and just three days before her nest
would have gone in she decided that her frayed nerves and thwarted
maternal instincts must find some outlet and she gnawed a large hole
in her mate's skull ! It was some weeks before I could get hold of
a green cock and although they paired at once and the hen was often
in a tree-trunk she never properly settled down and finally dropped
into moult without laying. Fatal matrimonial disputes through the

pair being kept back from nesting are a very real danger both with
Grass Parrakeets and some of the smaller members of the Ringneck
family and it is often wise to separate the sexes. The alternative of
letting them nest when they want to is worse than useless and merely
results in young dead in the nest or shell, clear eggs, and a wasted
season. The Plumheads just mentioned last year reared four green
young which, to prevent accidents, I wintered in a flight cage in the
heated birdroom. I did not turn them out till the very end of May
but even so I was too early and a few cool days resulted in the two
hens developing chills which in one case proved fatal, although the
patient was taken into the hospital on the first sign of illness. Until
they have completed their first moult young Plumheads are more
liable to chill than any Parrakeet I know, and, like Long-tailed
Parrakeets and Vasa Parrots, they do not appear to have the slightest
power of recovery even from what, in another bird, would be a most
trifling illness.
Another menage that came to an end through incompatibility
of temperament was that of the Salawati and Amboina Kings. After
living with him for nearly two years and producing a young one that
died when ready to leave the nest, the Amboina without warning fell
upon her mate and scalped him. Thinking that her temper might
have been embittered by worry over her offspring and the approaching
moult I resolved to give the couple another chance. Accordingly,
when both were in breeding condition, I again introduced the Salawati.
The two birds seemed delighted to see each other, inspected the nest
together and went to roost side by side, but by 9 a.m. the following
morning she had scalped him again ! The Apache tendencies of the
Amboina King are most trying and unexpected and clearly it will be
impossible to breed from her unless I can obtain a powerful male of
her own large race able to keep her in proper subjection.
When the Salawati had recovered from his second adventure I tried
him with the Sula Island King, though with some misgiving as on a
previous occasion she had bullied him. This time, rather to my
surprise, she behaved better and allows him to be master. They have
not, however, nested, possibly because the Sula Island must now be
getting very old as I have had her not far short of 20 years.

The Marquess of Tavistock--Breeding Notes for 1933 381
My breeding pair of Barnards, the cock being B. crommelinae,
came to an untimely end last winter. One day I noticed both looking
ill with symptoms not easy to identify. The hen soon died and proved
to be suffering from tuberculosis. For a while the cock seemed likely
to recover but in the end he started to go very lame and I destroyed
him to save him from further suffering. This is the first case I have
had here of a deadly disease fortunately very rare in movable
aviaries and the origin of the isolated outbreak remains a mystery.
Towards the end of the winter my cock Rock Peplar, a trained
liberty bird, looked not quite right, having the appearance of having
banged himself or met with a similar injury. His eyes looked bright
and his appetite remained good, but he died rather suddenly and
proved to be a victim to aspergillosis, a disease which has occasionally
caused losses among non-psittacine birds. His widow was a most
erratic hen for whose mental attributes I entertained the lowest
opinion. Disregarding every shape and make of nest, she persisted,
year after year, in laying her eggs from the perch and then incubating
the perch from which she had projected them. I had practically made
up my mind to get rid of her, but, having foster parents available,
I decided to try and secure a fresh cock. The first, although of the
handsome yellow type so much to be preferred, proved an aviary-bred
degenerate of no use for stock purposes. The second was one of the
greenish West Australian birds, but I kept him as nothing better was
available. The hen was soon at her old tricks of inspecting nests
and refusing to listen to the threats of her partner and his entreaties
that she should set up house in one of them. When she was on the
point of laying I introduced a new wooden box with a coco-nut-husk
bottom which I should have considered most unsuitable for Rock
Peplars and one, moreover, which she had scorned the year before.
The contrary creature, however, took possession of it and after some
obvious hesitation as to whether it would not, after all, be better to
return to the perch, laid her eggs in it and started to sit and
at the time of writing has actually reared a fine son and two
daughters !
Barrabands did poorly. One pair that reared three young last
year had clear eggs and the pair that reared five have only two, though

they are lovely birds, no doubt owing to the extra feeding they
received. The third pair had young dead in the shell. The cock is a
youngster imported last autumn who only came into adult plumage
in mid-winter ; doubtless he will do better next year. It is rather
strange, though, that even when the feeding, management, and stock
are identical and there is no lack of sunshine before or during the
breeding season, for some elusive reason the fertility of eggs and
readiness of birds to lay will vary considerably in different years.
The Princess of Wales Parrakeets came into breeding condition
and paired but the hen would not take to any nest and did not lay.
I am hoping for better luck next year with an unrelated cock bred
by Mr. Harvey. This bird got ill when turned into the aviary in hot
weather and I mean to try and acclimatize him to outdoor life in winter
when the microbes are less active. He is at present in a flight cage in
the bird-room and has learned to imitate perfectly all the cries of the
Roseate Cockatoos in the adjoining aviary !
The Crimson-wings reared four good young but one was found
dying from a mysterious injury to the mouth a short time after it had
left the nest.
Although the cock spends most of the year at liberty and the hen
lays twice each season the fertility of the Australian Kings' eggs is
always very low. This year only one of the first clutch hatched.
Usually the hen waits until her first lot of offspring are out in the world
before she lays a second time, but this year she laid again about a
fortnight before the young one flew. She is a devoted mother,
continuing to feed her first family even when she is incubating the
second lot of eggs, but this year her concern for her child proved
unfortunate. The day it left the nest anxiety for its welfare and
desire to assist it in its first exploration of the outside world proved
the stronger impulse and she deserted her eggs in order to do her duty
by her debutante daughter ! One of the eggs that looked fertile was
entrusted to the Grey Parrot, but I fear with no good result, for Polly,
like most old maids of the parrot family, only likes eggs and should
one happen to hatch is so shocked by the unexpected event that she
destroys the pink monstrosity.

Island King was given a couple of lutino-bred Ringneck's eggs which
unfortunately failed to hatch. After this she laid two more infertile
clutches. I must try and get her a mate of her own species as it is a
pity such a fine breeder should be wasted. The third Crimson-wing,
paired to the Princess of Wales Hybrid did not nest, neither did a new
Australian King imported last autumn.
The Worcester's Hanging Parrot, paired to the Golden-backed,
as usual laid and faithfully incubated two infertile clutches, an
experiment in vitamin feeding failing to achieve any good result.
The Racket-tailed Parrots for a long time raised my hopes, the hen
visiting the nest freely, but no eggs appeared and they are now in
moult.
The lutino Blue-fronted Amazon continues to disappoint me,
though she has come into breeding condition more than once and quite
often enters the nest. I have never been able to get a really satis-
factory cock for her. The last one, though most ferocious with human
beings and a good flier, refused to pair and always began to moult
in May when the lutino was most eager to breed. His successor is
so wing-stiff from long caging that he cannot fly after nearly two years
in the aviary, he is stupidly nervous and nearly has a fit every time
anyone passes within twenty yards of him and he, too, has a predilection
for May moulting. A pair of Red-collared Lorikeets, lent me by
Keston, laid two eggs that failed to hatch. They are vicious brutes,
the hen being even worse than her companion in her whole-hearted
efforts to bite.
A new pair of Leadbeater's Cockatoos nested and laid four eggs--
rather a large clutch for Cockatoos in confinement. Unfortunately,
though he sat well, the cock refused to pair. I have reason to think
he will do better next season.
The white Roseate and his grey mate again reared two grey young
ones, I think a pair. Their two sons of last year have grown into
fine strong birds. I have been fortunate recently in securing a nice
pair of true Albinos with pink feet and reddish eyes (my old cock's
feet and eyes are normal) so that in time with good luck I may be able
to build up a strain of this very beautiful variety. A white Roseate
in good plumage is even lovelier than a Leadbeater as the breast is

a much richer pink and a better contrast to the snowy wings. I was
hoping to breed another lutino Bingneck, but the law of averages was
relentless and I had to pay for my good fortune last year when two
fine lutinos were reared in one brood and have since grown well.
One pair which have never yet produced anything with both size
and stamina reared an extremely fine green young one. The hen
is not a very good flier and plucks the feathers of her rump and to see
if I could offset those evidences of degeneracy I gave them nothing
to drink except water containing yolk of raw egg and orange juice.
I intend to try further experiments by giving this mixture to birds
rearing young.
The hen who reared the lutinos last year is a most miserable
specimen and unable to fly and her mate is not much better, either
physically or morally, for he is a baby-killer and has to be removed
before his offspring hatch. This year the mother of the lutinos got
egg-bound with her second egg. When an elderly hen Bingneck begins
to get egg-bound it usually means the end of her breeding career and
the signal of approaching sterility. I wondered if the two lutinos
would not prove to be the old lady's swan-song in the breeding line !
The first pair of eggs failed to hatch under foster parents but in May
the Bingneck nested again and although she made rather heavy
weather of it, succeeded, with the aid of hot sun and warm nights,
in laying two more eggs which not only hatched but produced
two fine green young ones fully reared and free from any defects.
The third pair of Bingnecks were a lutino-bred cock and a three-
year-old untested green hen bred from lutino-breds. I was rather
inclined to think that this hen was sterile, for, as a two-year-old she
had taken not the slightest interest in the nest-box. However, I was
wrong for she laid four eggs and hatched two green young which she
reared, though she plucked their heads and backs rather badly and one
is not a very good specimen.
Barnards did nothing beyond look at their nest, the hen being a
young one, and wintered indoors.
The Pennants hatched three out of six eggs in the coco-nut-husk
box for which the hen has a predilection. One died when a few days
old. The others are about half-grown at the time of writing. I am

anxious to get another cock as the present one is elderly and eccentric
and a very lazy husband and parent.
The Browns did badly, hatching only one of their eggs and losing
the young one. Here again the cock needs replacing. A second pair
on loan from Keston arrived late in the season and did not settle down
to business. Brown's Parrakeets have an unrivalled capacity for
moulting. Their North Australian origin seems to upset their calendar
and many never seem to get it straight again and their motto appears
to be 44 when in doubt, moult The result is that some individuals
accomplish more moults in a year than a Grouse and, while it does not
seem to upset their general health, it seriously interferes with their
breeding. Their compatriots the Hooded are nearly as tiresome.
My hen resolutely refuses to adopt himself to our seasons. She lays
first in October whether she has a nest or not ; loses her young ; nests
again in mid-winter and gets egg-bound ; raises false hopes by dropping
a few feathers in February, moults steadily from March to July, comes
into show condition in August and begins to take a leisurely interest
in the nest in September.
The hen Rosella refused to settle down in the healthy natural tree
trunk I provided her with, but immediately took to a wooden box
I offered in desperation late in the season. She would have done better
to follow my choice of a nest and not her own, for of the six young
hatched one died in the nest and the other five were rickety, two
succumbing after they had flown or rather fallen out.
The Queen of Bavaria Conures had three clear eggs as in 1932.
I have now changed the cock. The present one unfortunately cannot
fly as he has been treated by the native method which, by permanently
destroying the end primaries on one side has the effect of pinioning
without removal of the joint. He is, however, a more richly coloured
bird than the full-winged one and seems anxious to breed.
The Purple Sunbirds did nothing. The cock seemed to want to
nest and at times got very annoyed with the hen and attacked her so
spitefully that it was necessary to provide plenty of thick clumps
of bushes for her to hide in.
The odd cock, a very old bird, managed to break his leg, but it has
mended perfectly with no attention.

The Senegal Sunbirds have also done nothing although I think
their breeding season must be later as the cock is just starting to sing.
The Fairy Bluebirds laid three times, but the hen got egg-bound
with the second egg of both the first clutches. I removed the cock
as he appears to be an egg-eater. The first time the hen sat unsteadily
and soon upset her egg. For the second venture we made her a nest
in an open wire box which she took to readily and she sat quite well,
hatching one young one, but throwing it out of the nest when about
a week old. The third time she would not sit.
My failure to induce the Rothschild's Birds of Paradise to nest was
explained when this summer the " hen " moulted into a young cock.
The curious thing was that the fine adult cock was desperately afraid
of the immature one, but I have known the same thing happen with
Fairy Bluebirds. It hardly supports the new theory that the object
of the bright colours of male birds is to terrify rivals ! The Rothschild's
are moulting at rather a sensible time of year for Birds of Paradise,
i.e. in late summer and autumn. The hen King Bird of Paradise carried
nesting material about a few weeks ago but the cock had not fully
completed his moult.
The big Banksian Cockatoo is sitting but I fear the result will be
the usual clear eggs.
The cock Palm Cockatoo seemed disposed to feed his mate but they
are still very wild and go no further. They seem to be partly nocturnal
in their habits as I often hear their strange cries during the hours of
darkness.
I have unfortunately lost one of my Imperial Amazons from
enteritis. It had been ill earlier in the year, but recovered. The
survivor, Mr. Porter's bird, with the broken wing, I decided to release,
as it never seemed happy in confinement and I thought it would enjoy
climbing about with the shot-damaged Bouquet's. It never used its
wings in the aviary and the only time I saw it try to do so it fell to the
ground like a stone. What was our surprise, therefore, on letting it
out, to find that it could fly as if it had never had the slightest
injury. It is at present living wild in the wood at the back of the
aviaries, feeding on apples and acorns and refusing to come down for
artificial food.

The Marquess of Tavistock--Breeding Notes for 1933 387
The most interesting new arrival is a Intino hen Rosella, a very
beautiful bird indeed. The blue areas of the normal Rosella's plumage
are snow-white or white faintly tinged with blue ; part of the green
and yellow areas are very pale lemon and the head, rump, and upper
breast are mainly orange-red, the feathers of the mantle being edged
with the same colour. The eyes are red and the feet pink. Naturally
I shall try and breed from her but I fear it will not be easy, partly
because she is tame and inclined to be cheeky ; partly because she
seems to have been kept in a cage a long time and is rather fat and
her constitution may not be of the Best and she may not be easy to
acclimatize to aviary life.
. Three cock Malabars are also a welcome new addition as my only
other cock is a lunatic who bites off his flight feathers at the beginning
of each breeding season and has damaged feet and beak. As a mate for
my best breeding hen I got the loan of a cock I bred myself some years
ago, but he did not do well and without being in any way ill did
not come into proper breeding condition and the hen got fed up with
him and did not lay.
The spinster Layard again nested but her eggs were infertile as she
had not time to get on friendly terms with the Plumhead I introduced.
The cock Slaty-head and hen Plumhead that lost their solitary
young one in the nest last year I provided this season with a natural
tree trunk as I find young Plumheads very intolerant of any substitute
for a completely natural nursery. Three eggs hatched : one young
one disappeared at an early stage, the others, a pair, have been reared.
They resemble young Plumheads, but their central tail feathers are
brighter blue with white tips and their heads have a dusky tinge.
A pair of White-capped Parrots (Pionus senilis) nested as soon as
they were turned out and the hen hardly left the nest for weeks. Their
one egg failed to hatch, but she appears to be sitting again. A young
bird was hatched from the second nest but was killed by the cock
when a week old.
A hen Stella's Lorikeet has been a brief joy, for soon after her
arrival, when she was doing nicely, she found a hole in the wire and
vanished into the unknown !

The Blue Eared-Pheasant is unquestionably among the very rarest
of Pheasants. Although it was discovered as early as 1811 as recorded
by Brehur, it was only last year that a healthy breeding pair was
successfully brought to Europe, so that notwithstanding attempts
by well-known connoisseurs 120 years elapsed before the first attempt
could be made at breeding it in captivity. This is easily comprehensible
when its rarity even in its native country and the great difficulty of
transporting it to the coast are taken into consideration.
In the autumn of last year I was enabled to realize my long-standing
intention of obtaining a true pair of Blue Eared-Pheasants. They
arrived at the beginning of December after a journey of 20,000
kilometres, not merely living but actually in good health, though not
until several weeks had elapsed did I dare even hope as much. Fortune
was still kinder in that after some months I saw from their
behaviour that I had a true pair. I could not ascertain this fact at
once because the plumage of Eared-Pheasants is alike in both sexes.
True, the hens have no spurs, but neither have the young cocks, so
there was always the possibility that my " pair " would turn out to be
merely an old and a young male bird. My last fear, that one of them
was very old and therefore past breeding, proved to be unfounded.
The first egg was laid on the 21st of April. Although the long enclosure
was planted with growing hedges affording ample opportunity for
concealment, the hen chose a fairly open corner of her shelter behind
a few dry sticks stuck in the ground, where with beak and feet she
dug a trough-like scrape. The egg was pale greyish brown and weighed
55 gr. It was pointed at one end and very blunt at the other, but
this may be merely a peculiarity of my hen, for I know that some of
the Brown Crossoptilons lay similarly shaped eggs while others lay
long ovals.
The second egg was laid three days later, and the third to the eighth
at intervals of two days, but there was only one day between the
eighth and ninth ; this was noticeably smaller than its predecessors,
and it only weighed 38 gr. whereas all the rest weighed practically

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997274527777778" page_id="56237619"  page_num="389" year="" vol="">
55 gr. Two days again between the tenth to the fifteenth, but the
last two, the sixteenth and seventeenth, were laid at intervals of three
days. They were all laid punctually at about 7 p.m.
As Brown Eared-Pheasants will not incubate in confinement,
I concluded that the Blue would behave in like manner, so I took the
eggs as soon as they were laid and put them under a domestic hen.
All were fertile. The incubation lasted from 27 to 30 days.
The chicks are very active and independent, they need little
brooding and rarely seek the warmth of their foster mother. They
are easily reared on ants' eggs, worms, and a good deal of green stuff,
but they eat considerably more than other Pheasant chicks. During
the first weeks of their lives they are very lethargic after a meal, and
usually squat down on the ground in order to digest their food at
leisure. Although they are usually peaceable together, greed at feeding
time causes many squabbles during which neither will give way.
Their fondness for worms sometimes misleads the chicks while still very
young into thinking that the feet of their brethren are worms and to
seize hold of them. They hold on so tight and are so determined to
secure the fancied tit-bit that the owner of the toes falls on his back
kicking before the other realizes his mistake. Dislocated and even
broken toes sometimes result, for which reason weaker species must
never be associated with young Eared-Pheasants for fear of having
their feet mutilated.
Thanks to their excellent appetites the chicks grew with extra-
ordinary rapidity. They were as large as a fair-sized domestic hen
by the time they were two months old.
In down the Blue Eared-Pheasants scarcely differ from the Brown
at the same stage, but when they are about a month old their blue
plumage shows plainly.
Blue Eared-Pheasants, like their brown cousins, are tame and
confiding with human beings, unlike the timidity usually shown by
young Pheasant chicks.
It is greatly to be hoped that this rare Pheasant will be permanently
established in Europe. If they can be at liberty in a large garden they
are useful in destroying injurious insects and charm their owners by
their remarkable tameness and beautiful colouring.

We found her in the garden one Sunday afternoon. She could not
fly, and was trying desperately to hide among the ferns. Since she
would certainly have fallen victim to a cat or my Crow, we caught her.
She was very quick, and dodged very cleverly.
She was terrified. We took her into the house and forcibly fed
her. We fed her several times during the evening, and put her to bed
in a little travelling cage I keep for emergencies such as these.
At 5.30 the following morning I got up and fed her from my feeding
tube. She was very hungry, and opened her beak to be fed. She was
much less frightened.
When I went out I took her with me in her little box and fed her,
off and on, at frequent intervals all day. I had to take her out to feed,
but she did not mind, and by the end of the day she would perch on
my hand when I put it into the box and allow me to take her out.
She would sit there while I fed her.
I now allowed her some freedom, and she would make small flights
but always landed on a lower level than from where she started. She
was unable to rise. In the railway carriage she would flutter up the
cushions of the seat, using her legs and wings.
I took her with me each day, and fed her continuously at short
intervals on " Egbisco ". I made it very moist, so that she got plenty
of fluid. She would not drink at this time.
She became tamer every day, and was very confiding. She now
would come out of her box of her own free will to be fed, and would
sit on my hand and preen herself. Her tail and flight feathers were
dirty and stuck together, so I washed them, which she greatly
appreciated.
I made a tray for her to play on. I covered it with sand, and she
would have sand baths at frequent intervals. At odd times sho would
go into her box and have a little nap. On waking up she would come
to me to be fed.
She never looked really well, though she was quite lively. Her
feathers were somewhat ruffled and she carried her little wings

dropped ; never close to her body. Her " tummy " was very prominent,
devoid of feathers, and red !
As the days passed she lost all fear, and did not like being in her
box ; so I gave her her freedom whenever possible. She now spent
her time on my desk or perched on my hand or shoulder. In this
manner she would go about the house with me.
At hospital or clinic she was always out either on my shoulder or
on the table, where she would amuse herself pecking about among the
papers or on the inkstand. From time to time she would come to
me to be fed.
At home, during tea, she sat on the table, or on the cake, and
now commenced to feed herself. She took a great fancy to butter
and sponge cake !
At dinner time she spent her time running between me and my
wife, running across the table to us ; sometimes perching on my hand
or arm, and sometimes on my wife's. She would help herself from our
plates.
She spent the evenings on my lap, occasionally running up my
arm on to my shoulder and pecking at my neck. From time to time
she would creep under my coat and go to sleep.
As I was busy on Sunday afternoon, my wife " nursed " her. Little
Joan sat on her hand or pen as my wife wrote letters, sometimes
cuddled up against her neck to keep warm.
When I went into the room she flew across to me and perched on
my hand. She appeared very fond of me !
She was now able to feed herself well, and wouldn't take food from
me. I attributed this to the fact that she probably was getting enough
herself. On Monday I took her out with me, and we went to the stores
and bought a cage for her. I put her into the cage and she settled
down and seemed to like it. There was food in the cage which she
sampled and picked about on the sand and had a sand bath. She
spent the morning in the cage which I left in the car when I went
into the hospital. I left her at home in the afternoon. She only
wanted to get out when she saw me. On opening the cage door she
flew out and on to my shoulder, where she seemed quite happy. She
slept a good deal on this day, and I was afraid all was not well.

In the evening she perched on the swing in the cage, and I covered
her up at night.
On Tuesday I found her dead at the bottom of the cage.
So ended a short but, I hope, a happy life.
The P.M. findings showed inflammation of the bowel, with ulceration
of the mucus membrane.
I have had many birds, some of them very tame, but never such a
sweet confiding little thing as this one.
We had got very fond of her, and her death distressed us very much.
This is the fifth Sparrow I have tried to rear. All but one have
died. The one that lived was somewhat older than the others. I let
her go as soon as she was strong on the wing, as she would not settle
down in a cage.
I think all these young birds one finds at this time of the year,
those who cannot fly, are probably sick birds. That is probably why
one cannot rear them.
I am very fond of Sparrows. I think they are more clever than
any other little birds. A friend of mine who was very keen on his
garden did not like Sparrows. He set a trap for them. It was a sort
of eel trap. He never caught a single Sparrow ! He caught many
Robins. He watched the trap, and noticed the Sparrows going in
and out. They would eat all the food they could pack in, and carry
off as much as they could manage, and then come back for more !
If any member of the Society can give me some tips as to feeding
baby Sparrows I shall be grateful.
[Sparrows of the year may be captured in hundreds by means of the ee]
type of trap--there are no more easy birds to trap; but once they have
become adult they have acquired wisdom and are most difficult to
catch.--E d.]

Viscount Grey of Falloden, who died at his ancestral home on
7th September, had been a member of the Avicultural Society for

twenty years. He was known and admired throughout the world as
a great statesman, but to many of us was also known and beloved
as a naturalist of the very best type and a most charming gentleman.
To go for country walks with him was the most delightful experience,
for no one that I ever met was better at identifying the notes of wild
birds, or appreciating the beauties of the country. I shall never forget
a week-end spent with him in Wiltshire and the bird walks we took.
I thought I knew the notes of most of the wild birds, but I was
stumped by some of those we heard. Lord Grey, however, was never
at a loss, and several bird songs which I was not certain of then I can
always identify since those walks in which he acted as my tutor. The
late Lady Grey was then alive, and she too was a devoted bird-lover,
not only taming the wild birds in her garden, but also those in her
large garden aviary.
But the place beloved of all others by Lord Grey was his home,
Falloden, in Northumberland; a spot within 2 miles of the sea
but far from the madding crowd, surrounded by woods and water ;
a charming garden where, in spite of its northern latitude, bamboos
and other semi-hardy plants grew to perfection. Here he protected
the birds and taught them to be perfectly fearless. The wild birds
fed from his hands and even the red squirrels entered his house and
took nuts from his fingers. And here he had his fine collection of
Waterfowl; many species, some very rare such as the Hinged and
Cinnamon Teal, and the Canvas-back. For the past twelve or more
years no duck has been pinioned, with the result, of course, that a good
many have been lost ; but on the other hand, a great number have
stayed and all have become perfectly tame. Lord Grey was devoted
to his ducks which, when at home, he fed himself every evening,
summer and winter, with his own hands. On two occasions I was
privileged to accompany him on this evening hour with his ducks.
The time was sunset and as the great statesman, clad in an ancient

raincoat and old felt hat, left the house with a basket of grain in
one hand and another full of bread-crusts in the other, a procession
of ducks came across the lawn to meet him. A pair of Mandarins,
impatient to reach him first, were not content to walk or run, but
flew, the duck landing on his head and the drake at his feet. Lord
Grey took up his accustomed position in a garden seat beneath a
large tree within a few yards of the water and was at once surrounded
by a quacking, whistling, chattering crowd of ducks of all kinds.
Some were so tame that they jumped on to the seat or on to their
owner's head or shoulders, showing no fear whatever. I at first sat
on another seat at some little distance in case, being a stranger,
the birds should resent my presence ; but as they did not seem to
mind me I was invited to share the favoured seat. Lord Grey was
very blind, but he could just see the ducks as they came close, and
he seemed to know each individual. As one approached he pointed to
it : " Is not that a Canvas-back ?" he said, and on my reply in the
affirmative, " She has a nest by the other pond. She was hatched here
three years ago, and in her first autumn entirely left us and was
away for no less than two years. Then one evening during feeding time
she flew in and came straight up to the feeding place as if she had
never been away. Where can she have been ? "
All the ducks were allowed to nest and rear their young under
natural conditions, broody hens never being employed, but all the same
quite a number of ducklings were reared each year, special feeding
cages placed at the sides of the ponds, just above water-level, allowing
the ducklings to enter for food but excluding the adult birds.
And now Lord Grey has had his wish to end his days in the home
he loved and amongst the birds he loved, and England has lost one
of her greatest sons and the birds a devoted friend.

THE BLUE EARED-PHEASANT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99333828" page_id="56237627"  page_num="395" year="" vol="">
I read with great pleasure Herr H. Stefani's interesting article on the
Eared-Pheasant in the August number of the Magazine. There are,
however, a few points where I am not quite in accord with him.
The young cocks do show spurs in their first year ; in most specimens
they are fully developed when a year old, and it is quite easy to tell the
cocks from the hens when they are about six months old.
Also, I am afraid Eared-Pheasants are not gardeners and spoil a garden
in no time by digging. I should advise keeping them in parks or enclosures,
but not in well-kept gardens. As Herr Stefani suggests, two dozen Blue
Eared-Pheasants reached Cleres in 1929, one hen alone being among them.
But I should like to emphasize that neither myself nor my friend Professor
Ghigi ever offered hybrids for pure bred Blues ! They are quite different
from both parents, and although nearer to the Blue, cannot be confused
with it. In the next number of VOiseau will be found an exhaustive study
of these hybrids and of Crossoptilon in general by Professor Ghigi, which
gives all necessary details of the birds. Neither have three-quarter Blue-
bred hybrids, the majority of which are quite indistinguishable from full-
blooded Blues, ever been offered for sale.
The seven-eighths Blue-bred birds have reverted completely to pure Blues
and can be safely considered as such; one cannot tell them from my old
imported birds.
I may add that a couple of dozen of wild caught Blue Eared-Pheasants
were imported into California last winter; some have already been bred
there and will soon come to France, I hope.

bringing between them about thirty head of Sunbirds of eight species or
sub-species, all in wonderful condition and with one possible exception new
to Aviculture. Every one of them found a new home with different members
or in the Zoo on the day of arrival or thereabouts.

ADDITIONS TO BREEDING RECORDS; SOME CORRECTIONS

<bodyText confidence="0.928451" page_id="56237628"  page_num="396" year="" vol="">
In the Additions to Breeding Records which have been appearing in
the Magazine recently, a few errors need correction.
(1) The three paragraphs on pp. 44 and 45, 1933, must be replaced by
the following :--
Records, p. 86, Nos. 370 and 371. The specific name of the Passerine
Parrakeet, (" Blue-wing Lovebird ") must be changed to vividus Ridgw.,
and that of the Guiana Parrotlet to passerinus Linn., and for this
a better English name is Green-rumped Parrotlet. Apart from this
change of names, Records 370 and 371 can stand, but to the second
add " Tavistock ( Parrots , p. 155) says he did breed this species at
liberty and that it has also been bred at Brighton."
Add. 371, i. Blue-rumped Parrotlet (F. cyanopygius Bp.). Bred by
Mrs. Goddard in 1927. (Medal.) A.M., 1928, 52.
Add. 371, ii. Green-rumped Parrotlet (F. passerinus viridissimus Lafr.).
Bred by Dr. Plath in Chicago in 1924, one young one being reared ; see
Aviculture {U.S.A.), 1932, p. 83, where a coloured plate showing about
six species is given. In the account the author unfortunately uses
" vivida " for this species, but from the context alone, one can see he
meant to write " viridissima ". Whitley in 1921 also reared a brood of
this Parrotlet, which I saw.
Add. 371, iii. Spectacled Parrotlet (P. conspicillatus Lafr.). A hybrid
record only.
Add. p. 225 of Records :--
Spectacled x Blue-rumped Parrotlet
{conspicillatus x cyanopygius). Bred by Mrs. Tomlinson in California teste
Plath {see Aviculture as above) in 1930; this cross was first reported

AVICULTURE IN NEW ZEALAND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998912827586207" page_id="56237629"  page_num="397" year="" vol="">
Members in this small far away country take great interest in birds as
you will see from the published list of members in the January, 1933, issue
of the Avi cultural Magazine.
As we have rather a good connection for obtaining birds from India, we
number amongst our collections such birds as Blue-winged Siva, White-
capped Redstarts, Little Minivets, Rufous-bellied Niltavas, Shamas, etc.
For food we use a local insectivorous food made from dried flies and ants'
eggs, etc., mixed with best quality Madeira cake and finely chopped hard-
boiled eggs and, in addition, mealworms and, during autumn, grass-hoppers,
and at other times of the year a small amount of insect life obtainable such
as spiders, etc.
We have been able to keep in excellent health and plumage Blue-winged
Sivas, Little Minivets, etc., but have experienced difficulty in getting the
Redstarts and the Rufous-bellied Niltavas to moult their primary flight
feathers.
In the case of the Niltava it has been given, in addition, a Vitamine
preparation supposed to contain Vitamines A, B, C, and D. This preparation,
we are informed, has made possible the rearing of blue foxes in captivity.
But in spite of this the Niltava has not thrown its flights, although the rest
of the bird moulted perfectly.
With the Redstarts they are still at liberty in an outdoor aviary and can
fly comparatively well but, nevertheless, their primary flights have not been
renewed this last moult.
Can you advise any treatment which would rectify this trouble ?
You will be interested to hear that I have a true pair of the Mountain Blue
Birds which, at the moment, have gone into a real good moult and should,
with luck, go to nest this coming September or October.
We in New Zealand are particularly interested in the feeding of birds owing
to our limited experience and not having the markets of the world at our

CORMORANT KILLING YOUNG DUCKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99094875" page_id="56237630"  page_num="398" year="" vol="">
For a number of years I have kept and bred a large quantity of different
varieties of Duck.
I had about 20 young ones in a wire enclosure below the sluice of my
larger pond, through which there flowed a small stream of water. Seven
ducklings were not quite half-grown, the others nearly full grown. On
Saturday evening, 26th August, at evening feed time all seven of the small
ones were lying dead, terribly mutilated, and all laid out in a row on the bank.
The culprit was observed at the far end of the pond and was luckily shot.
He proved to be a full-grown young male Black Cormorant.
I sent him up to the Zoo to make certain I was correct as to his species.
I should be interested to hear if a Black Cormorant has ever been shot so
far inland. I live four miles from Buckingham and the nearest point to
the sea is some sixty miles.
Also have any of the readers of the Avicultural Magazine known of a
case where Cormorants attack any form of bird life ?

FRIENDLY SHELD-DUCKLINGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998019107142857" page_id="56237630"  page_num="398" year="" vol="">
An interesting instance of young Sheld-ducks seeking human society is
recorded in the September number of British Birds. At 9.30 p.m. on 1st July,
1933, six baby Sheld-ducks appeared at the door of a hut on Scolt Head Island,
where Mr. and Mrs. Pelham were staying, and positively refused to leave.
Mr. Pelham writes : " There was an old bird flying over the sea in wide
circles calling, so we took the ducklings down to the dunes, hoping that they
would be seen, but the parent, after flying wider, eventually disappeared.
Meanwhile, the ducklings had returned to the hut; as it was getting dusk
and cool, we made up a ' nest' in a basket and put them in it.
" The next morning early the ducklings were grouped round our bedroom
door. We gave them a bowl of water and a bowl of bread and milk, but they
made no attempt to drink until my wife had taken them up and held their
bills in the bread and milk, after which they cleared it up, and subsequently
fed eagerly on this, but practically ignored the water, even on a very hot day.
" The ducklings now insisted on following us everywhere we went, even
if it was only to cross from one hut to another. If we remained inside they
settled down by the door and if left by themselves they started calling, but
stopped immediately when one of us came out. When we sat outside they
gathered round our feet and dozed or crawled under our legs for shelter from
the sun and even climbed up us if we were lying down.
" By the next day it had become almost embarrassing to act thus as
foster parents as the ducklings insisted on following us, and as there was no
sign of the real parents we took them down to the marshes in the evening,
but even in the undergrowth here, where they could not possibly see us,
they made a bee-line for us from the edge of a creek for a distance of about
200 yards, so that we were forced to take them back to the hut again.
" On the following day, 4th July, we left the hut to walk over to the
mainland at low water. Although we tried to drive them back, the ducklings

persisted in following us. So we walked away quickly, but apparently they
kept straight on after us for about a quarter of a mile until they came to
water, and they were seen later (when we were on the mainland) swimming
down Overy Creek.
" On our return we saw an old Sheld-duck flying low over the creek, so
it is to be hoped that the ducklings were eventually found by their parents."

HONEY AS FOOD FOR BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.944110416666667" page_id="56237631"  page_num="399" year="" vol="">
I note with interest the arrival of a consignment of Humming Birds in
Europe and that the London Zoo have some of them. They are bound to be
of great interest to the public and for study purposes, as they are such
a specialized avian family.
Doubtless all concerned have had experience in feeding this class of
" Soft-bills " and that the food given is as perfect as it is possible to get.
I would like to mention, however, that our experience with honey is not at
all good. We find that it is more or less poisonous to small birds, giving them
fits and liver trouble. If there is any indication that the food is not agreeing
with them perfectly it might be as well to delete this ingredient from the
mixture.

THE RETURN OF THE GRASS PARRAKEETS
It is very interesting to note that our small Grass Parrots, which for a long
time were so scarce, are apparently coming into their own again. This indicates
that some species, at any rate, were decimated by a disease, and that their
disappearance was not wholly due to settlement. The only species that is
still very scarce is the Paradise (Psephotus pulcherrimus), though I have reason
to believe that it is not as limited in numbers as it is thought to be.
We are just now erecting a series of new aviaries for these Parrots, and
hope to have all species represented, even the inconspicuous Rock Parrot
(Neonanodes petrophila).
Two of our Macaws laid last year, but we were not able to get fertile eggs.
However, with different feeding we hope for better results this season.

PHEASANTS' EGGS HATCHING AFTER VOYAGE TO

they were placed under broody hens. They were carefully looked after on the
voyage--placed in a cool room and the box turned over every day. Mr. Niall
has received the following letter from his man in Melbourne.
" I am writing to let you know how the Pheasants' eggs turned out and
am glad to say they are a great success. Out of twenty-nine fertile eggs
twenty-six hatched, the young birds being quite as strong as any we have
hatched here. There is one Reeve's and nine Mutants, and of the remainder
we cannot at present tell what they are."
Considering the long period which elapsed from the time the eggs were
laid until they were put under hens in Australia, this is a great achievement,
probably due, to a certain extent, to the fact that the eggs v/ere very fresh
when shipped, and to the great care that was taken of them on the voyage.

THE RED-EARED FIRETAIL FINCH

of Western Australia)
Description .--General colour, above olive brown, finely barred with

blackish brown, the bars becoming closer towards the head ; rump
bright red, tail feathers olive and barred with blackish brown ; lores
a narrow line and feathers around the eye black ; patch behind the
eye crimson ; chin, throat, and upper breast yellowish olive, finely

As far as I am aware, I am the only aviculturist in Australia to
have this bird in captivity. I therefore feel competent to state my
observations to date.
The only place in Australia where this bird can be found is, practically,
one spot in the extreme south-west of this State, the maximum
temperature in summer being 80* and the minimum in winter 45*.
I tried for years to procure this bird (it is extremely rare) but without
success. I financed a trapper last year and in three months his efforts
resulted in sixteen birds only ! This species is mostly seen singly and
never more than a pair together. Their natural haunts are about

H. V. Highman--The Bed-eared Firetail Finch
marshy land where they hug the dense shrubs, rarely being seen in
the open.
My specimens were trapped one at a time and placed in a small
cage and there retained sometimes for six weeks until twelve birds
were secured. The dozen were then railed to me in Perth, 200 miles
away. I turned these birds straight into my aviary, and from two
dozen birds the losses to date are three, one death being that of a
specimen I forwarded to S. Harvey, a leading South Australian
aviculturist, nearly a thousand miles away. My aviary is approximately
20 X 8 X 7 feet high. One end is completely enclosed to form
a shelter, and the flight is roofed and packed with dense foliage and
small bushes. In this aviary many species are kept, ranging from soft
food eaters to Parakeets, the food being greatly diversified and consisting
of canary, panicum, millett, linseed, rape, and the usual greens and
soft food. The Red-ears have access to this varied diet and seem to
partake of all, including the soft food.
During the day they hide deep in the bushes and are rarely seen,
but early morning and sundown they are extremely lively. At the
outset I was astonished at their tameness. When entering the aviary
to feed in the mornings they rarely departed from the seed table.
They keep to themselves and do not even mix with Zonceginthus hellus
(Beautiful Firetail) of which two pairs are cohabitants with three pairs
of Zonceginthus oculatus. The Red-ears are terrors for their morning
bath even on the coldest of mornings.
It is generally understood that this species nests from October to
February, but I have a pair nesting in August. The nest is deep in
the centre of a tea tree bush and is oval in shape, built of dried grasses
with an entrance at one side approached by a short tunnel formation.
Both birds constructed the nest. Three eggs have been laid and appear
pure white in colour. Being winter here and the days conse-
quently short, my time for observation is very limited, having my
business to occupy me during the day. This fact has not permitted
me to observe which bird is incubating the eggs. I cannot even sex

males. The call note is very mournful and only uttered in the early
morning and at sundown. To my whistled imitation they always
respond.
I am in great hopes of rearing youngsters and I feel this will not
be difficult. The Eed-ear impresses me by its extreme hardiness.
The three deaths before mentioned were two on arrival at the railway
station, the other dying in South Australia after a very long journey.
Eight presumed pairs I have forwarded to Germany, and I await
with interest news of their arrival. I feel sure, knowing them as I do,
that they will arrive in good condition.
Their habitat here is the coldest spot in Western Australia, and
I feel sure they would do well in England. I might add that they
definitely have never been allowed hemp in any shape or form as my
Finch experience has taught me not to use this seed. Mealworms,
gentles, and the like, have never been supplied, and I am convinced
Red-ears are not dependent on insect food.

The lovely fairy-like Pied Fantail (Rhipidura flabellifera ), one of
the commonest of New Zealand's endemic birds, is beloved by every
resident who has ever made its acquaintance. It is hard to imagine
a more dainty, more ethereal, atom of feathered life than the Fantail.
It is utterly fearless and if called by imitating its note will come
within a few inches of one, or perhaps perch on one's arm or head.
It moves through the forest with the most careless abandon, appearing
to be blown from branch to branch or tree to tree, so light and fairy-
like is its flight. No thistledown borne by the wind moves more lightly
or gracefully than this bird. The air seems to offer no resistance to it.
The beautiful fan-like tail, so large as to be quite out of proportion
to the size of the owner, is usually spread to its full extent and carried
at right-angles to the body.
The feathers are puffed out and the wings spread as the bird moves

rapidly through the forest so that it looks bigger than it really is.
Nearly all its food is taken on the wing, and it was always the source
of the greatest delight to watch these charming feathered mites
performing the most wonderful evolutions in the air in their attempts
to catch minute moths and flies.
In spite of its familiarity it is not found round human habitations
unless they are near to the forest patches, for its habitat is not in
the open country, but in and around the indigenous " Bush ". Often
in a patch of native " bush " only a few hundred square yards in
extent several pairs of fantails will be found.
It is grievous enough to think of the disappearance of such birds
as the Huia, the native Thrushes, etc., but the loss of the Fantail
would indeed be a tragedy. But this I do not think will ever happen,
unless every vestige of native " bush " is burnt, although most people
seem to be doing their best to accomplish this.
On one of the Chicken Islands the Fantail was exceedingly abundant,
and at one time--when up a tree watching the Parrakeets drinking
at their water hole--I counted no less than twenty-four round at one
time ; the air seemed to be full of huge snow-flakes. These friendly
little creatures did not come around in a flock but drifted up in ones
and twos, not to drink, but merely to satisfy their curiosity as to who
the stranger was. I could certainly have caught them with my hand
had I desired.
It is impossible to convey to the mind of the reader anything of
the dainty charm of this friendly little bird. Only those who have
made its acquaintance know how it at once endears itself to every
heart when once seen in the forest glades. Its charm is far too ethereal
to be written down in black and white.
Sometimes when wandering in the lonely forests I have been met
by one of these beautiful birds and been accompanied by it for perhaps
half a mile or so, flitting around all the time within a foot or two,
the only sign of animation in the gloomy interior. Whether it is purely
inquisitiveness or just sheer friendliness I do not know. It would be
better to think it the latter.
One often sees the Fantails hawking for insects over the streams
and rivers, and I have frequently seen them picking minute forms of

insect life off the surface of the water itself. They literally dance their
way silently through the forests like some giant snow-flake, never for
a second still ; even when they perch, the body is swayed from side
to side displaying the beautiful fan-like tail.
The nest is one of the most beautiful structures ever designed by
a feathered architect. It is very small, compact, and shaped like a
spinning top. It is composed of thistledown, fine moss, skeleton leaves,
and other such fine material, the whole being bound firmly together
with spiders' webs and then stuck all over with tiny bits of lichen.
A friend assured me that he had Watched the birds gathering the
webs by getting one side of the head covered with them and then
laying them on the nest. It is hard to believe that such a compact
structure is the work of a bird. It is woven around the stems of several
leaves, where they join the branch of the tree. So small is it that the
birds sit on top and not in it. Very often the two owners can be seen
sitting on it together, the female first and the male on her back as
though to protect her.
All efforts to keep this tiny species in captivity seem to have failed
until recently, when I saw in New Zealand four perfect specimens
which had been in captivity for over six months ; but these were living
in a huge aviary and feeding solely on their natural food, tiny flies,
and other insects attracted by the food of the other birds and also,
no doubt, by the goldfish pools in the aviaries. I doubt whether they
would ever live upon artificial food or in a cage and for that reason
I did not attempt to bring any back with me to Europe.
It is little to be wondered at that the Fantail finds its way into
many of the Maori legends.
Buffer, in his monumental work, The Birds of New Zealand , says :
" Long may the Pied Fantail thrive and prosper, in the face of cats,
owls, naturalists, and the whole race of depredators ; for without it
our woods would lack one of their prettiest attractions, and our fauna
its gentlest representative."
The New Zealand Fruit Pigeon (Hemiphaga novceseelandice)

one of the finest, equaling a small domestic hen in size, having the

head, neck and upper breast shining metallic green, the back a bronzed
maroon with a greenish gloss, the wings and tail grey with greenish
reflections and the whole of the lower breast and under parts snow
white ; the bill and iris are carmine red. Before the advent of the
white man to New Zealand this Pigeon was to be found in all the
forested parts in countless thousands. The white settlers soon got to
work and in a short space of time the birds were reduced to the merest
remnant. These birds, which were absolutely tame, formed a very
easy target for everyone with a gun. The slaughter was prodigious.
Not since the wholesale massacre of the Passenger Pigeon has there been
such a killing. Old settlers have told me that 200 in a day was no
unusual bag for one person. Loads were taken in to the city refrigerators
to be used at leisure. Needless to say, the race diminished until the
Pigeon was a rara avis. Fortunately the Government stepped in only
just in time with protective legislation and prevented the total exter-
mination of this fine bird. There was a great outcry at the time for
not only was the Pigeon the chief food for the Maori, but it was also
the bon bouche of the farmers. However, the bird was saved.
Ever since this bird was protected it has steadily increased until
it is now seen in nearly every large patch of forest reserve. My first
acquaintance with it was in the forest reserve at Lake Waikaremoana.
Here the birds, being free from all molestation, are comparatively
tame. In other places I had only heard the loud " whoof, whoof " of
the heavy wing beats as the bird sped away from its dreaded enemy.
Even now it is still shot in the out-of-the-way districts, and
I heard of a person when in the South Island who had shot eighty
only a few days before I arrived at a certain town in the extreme south.
Last August three Maoris were fined #15 each for killing over 300
Pigeons. Had they been white men and could have employed a good
lawyer they would doubtless have been acquitted, no doubt by pleading
as people do ali over the world when killing protected birds, that they
had mistaken them for hawks ! This shows how the Pigeon must have
increased during the years following the act which gave it full protection.
On Little Barrier Island it was a great joy to be able to study these
birds at very close quarters for they were excessively abundant and
their loud, noisy flight could be heard on every hand. Owing to freedom

from persecution they were very tame, allowing one to approach
within a few feet of them.
Our object when landing on the island was to pitch our camp as
near as possible to where the birds were the most numerous, so we
settled on a spot beneath a karaka-tree, which was covered with
ripening fruit. This fruit is shaped like a date, tapering at one end,
and is a bright orange colour when ripe. Here the Pigeons were in
plenty and one of the first sounds to be heard in the mornings as we
opened our eyes was the loud swish of their wings as they flew over
our tent to alight on the tree for their morning feed.
Despite their great beauty they are very heavy and clumsy in the
trees, seeming almost to fall off when reaching for the fruit. It was
very interesting to watch the birds testing whether the fruit was ripe
enough to eat. It was seized in the bill and gently pinched all
over. If not ripe it was left, and the same process repeated on another
berry until a ripe one was found when it was torn off and swallowed
whole.
I used every endeavour to obtain a pair of these beautiful Pigeons
to bring back home, but found that it was impossible to obtain any
on the mainland though I saw a few in captivity. It was just past
the breeding season when I arrived in New Zealand, or I might have
been able to get a pair of young ones. In the old days many colonists
possessed tame Pigeons which they had reared from the nest, usually
on bread and milk. There should be no difficulty in keeping this bird
for the diet upon which it seems to live for years on in captivity in
New Zealand is bread and milk and mashed potatoes, a most unsatis-
factory food one would think for a Fruit Pigeon. Kept in a state of
liberty, the Pigeon makes a very interesting pet, but when incarcerated
in a cage or aviary they are very dull and lethargic, as most Fruit
Pigeons are apt to be.
Like most other New Zealand birds it is very pugnacious and many
were the fights we watched around the karaka-tree. Sometimes a bird
would take possession of the tree driving all others away. Even when
he had satisfied his own hunger he would still keep guard. In the
forests we often saw two males fighting over the possession of a female.
Even in captivity the pugnacious disposition asserts itself for I was

shown one which had a few days previously almost killed a male
Ring-necked Pheasant which had been placed in the same aviary.
The birds would be about the same size but the Pigeon would have
the greatest weight behind it. They can also give some nasty hits
with the wings.
In spite of the usually laboured flight and the heavy body, the
Pigeon can upon occasion perform wonderful aerial feats. I believe
it is only the cock bird that does this and it no doubt forms some
kind of display. The bird rises up vertically out of its favourite tree,
rising to a great height, when it suddenly turns, opening its wings and
tail, and glides down to the same spot which it left. This is done over
and over again, especially in the evenings. It is a very strange spectacle
to watch from a distance several birds doing this at the same time.
When lying some distance off a forested island it appeared as
though giant balls were being thrown up and down from out of
the trees.
On Kapati Island I was shown a sitting bird which was so tame that
we could pick her off the nest and look at the egg. It was here that
I discovered that this Pigeon has a curious parasitic fly similar to one
I noticed on Vinage delalandei in East Africa. This peculiar fly is the
size of a common " blue-bottle ", but very flat in shape and a pale
grey colour. At times it runs about quickly over plumage but on the
slightest alarm it dives into the feathers. (The accompanying photo-
graph, taken of the bird after I left Kapati, shows this fly on the breast
of the bird. The young one had just hatched, hence the broken egg
shell.) Only one egg is laid, but I believe the bird nests twice in the
year. The nest is not the frail structure that most Pigeons make, and
great care is shown in choosing the site.
This bird cannot exist without large areas of forest for it feeds
almost entirely on the berries and fruits of the large forest trees such
as the karaka, miro, puriri, etc. The bearing seasons of the trees
vary according to the altitude so the Pigeon has to follow its
food supply.
I have been told that, owing to the scarcity of berries at certain
seasons, the birds are forced to feed to a large extent on various leaves
and during this period they are exceedingly thin. When there is a

good berry season the birds become so fat that if shot they burst with
the force of falling to the ground.
A dead bird was found under the karaka-tree near our tent, having
been choked by an extra-large berry ; it was exceedingly fat and
heavy and must have turned the scale at several pounds.
Buller states that this bird is strictly arboreal, but I have frequently
seen it on the ground feeding on the leaves on some small weed in the
caretaker's garden on the Little Barrier.
The colonists are able to tell by the flight whether the bird is fat
or otherwise. Usually it is at its best when the miro berries are ripe.
After feeding upon these berries the birds get very thirsty and in the
old days the Maoris took advantage of this by placing troughs of water
made out of hollowed logs up in the trees. When the birds became
accustomed to drinking out of them nooses were placed in such a
position that when they raised their heads they were caught.
The Pigeons formed the chief source of animal food of the inland tribes
of the Maoris. When large numbers of birds were caught they were
potted down in their own fat for further use. The irridescent feathers
were used in the making of beautiful cloaks, the white and green
feathers being arranged in various patterns. The cloaks which I saw
were in green and white checks, and very beautiful they looked. In
the making of these cloaks a thin base of fine flax was woven and the
feathers individually woven in. Much labour and patience would be
needed to make even a small one. There is a cloak in the Auckland
Museum composed wholly of the tail feathers of Tuis. Hundreds of
birds must have been killed in the making of this garment.
The Blue Wattled Crow (Callceas wilsoni )
My first and only sight of this strange bird was of one as it flashed.
across the road when I was motoring through the Urewera country. I
was thrilled even with the fleeting glance, for to-day this is one of the
rarest of New Zealand birds. The manager of the hostel at
Waikaremoana told me he had only seen it once in three years.
Why this bird is called a " crow " I do not know, for it is not related
to, neither does it resemble a Crow. It is a very distinct form
with no near affinities. It is about the size of a Mistle Thrush with

a longer tail, light slate-grey in colour, with a very thick, short beak,
and on each side of the lower mandible a round wattle, about the size
of a sixpence, of bright sky blue.
In the old days before the advent of the colonist this bird was
fairly numerous in the deep recesses of the forest. Like most of the
New Zealand birds it was remarkably tame and would come up to
inspect a stranger. It lived mainly in the undergrowth, never taking
long or sustained flights. It was chiefly famed for its remarkable
notes which are said to have resembled distant bells. In fact it
is mainly known to the old settlers as the " Bellbird " owing to its
musical powers.
With the burning of the bush it has disappeared from nearly all
parts of the North Island, being found only in one or two localities
such as the forest on Mount Egmont and the Urewera country.
I was told by an old naturalist that fifty or sixty years ago it was
plentiful in many wooded gullies, and he and several others made
representation to the Government asking to be allowed to catch several
pairs for release on the islands. But owing to the usual Government
apathy nothing came of it.
There is just a chance that this bird may hold its own and survive
in remote parts, but it is just as likely that the next few years will
see its extermination for at the present moment its fate is certainly
in the balance. It would be a matter of the greatest regret if this
unique species should pass away, for it is certainly one of the strangest
of New Zealand's very distinct avifauna.
One of my chief reasons for going to Stewart Island was to see the
southern representative of the Blue-wattled Crow, a bird exactly
similar except that the wattle is bright orange, at least three-quarters
of it, the base being blue. Owing to violent gales we could not land
at that part of the island where the bird is still found, so that I had to
come away disappointed. Even in Stewart Island, its last refuge, the
bird is rare. An old resident, who lives in the remote part where it is
still found, told me that he had only seen it two or three times in the
last seven years. Rats and the wild cats are its greatest enemy and
in time will no doubt lead to its ultimate extinction. In most parts
of the South Island it seems to have quite disappeared.

Sydney Portei--Notes on Neiu Zealand Birds
The Huia (Heteralocha acutirostris )
After mentioning the Wattled Crows I feel that I should not be
doing justice to the birds of New Zealand if I failed to mention the
Huia, the most unique of all the native birds and a near relation of
the Crows. So famous is this bird that there are numerous " Huia
Streets ", ships are called after it, many brands of commercial articles
are called " The Huia Brand " of so-and-so ; it is even a boy's
Christian name.
The final extermination of the Huia was brought about in a peculiar
way indirectly by the present king of England who visited the colony
about 1905. The black-and-white tail feathers had always been a mark
of great distinction when worn in the hair by the Maoris. Only the
chiefs and those of high rank were allowed to use them and these feathers
formed the basis of a considerable trade or barter between the different
tribes. There was to be a great gathering of the Maoris. Huia feathers
were in great demand for the auspicious occasion, but the question was
how to get them, for the Huia was then very rare.
A party of Maoris discovered what must have been the last existing
colony of these birds. The slaughter was great. The feathers were
sold for 75. 6 d. each, and the killers reaped a rich harvest. So passed
away one of the world's most interesting birds.
The Huia was a large bird the size of a crow, of a glossy black,
the end of the fairly long tail feathers being white. At the base of
the beak was a large orange-coloured wattle. The most remarkable
feature of the bird was that the male possessed a fairly stout, pointed
beak, similar to that of a woodpecker, while the female's was long,
thin, and curved into almost a semicircle. The birds appeared to work
in conjunction, the male chipping away decayed portions of trees to
obtain the succulent " huhu " grubs. If the grub was out of reach of
the male bird the female would be called in, and she with her specially-
adapted bill would secure the dainty.
At first the male and female were described as different species
but, as soon as the peculiarity was first noted, the skins became a very
desirable addition to the cabinets of collectors. There was an extensive
massacre and in less than fifty years after its discovery the Huia was
almost extinct. Buffer, the great New Zealand ornithologist, helped

more than any one in the extermination. He seemed to think it far
better to have a series of perishable skins in museums than to leave
a few living birds to perpetuate themselves for posterity.
The last living bird was seen in 1907 and since then there have
been various reports from non-scientific observers with regard to
seeing it. Expeditions have been out in search of it into all the remote
parts where it was formerly found, but have failed to trace it. In my
opinion there is as much chance of seeing the Huia again as there is
of seeing the Moa.
It was frequently kept in captivity in New Zealand in the old days
and several were sent to the London Zoological gardens, but they do
not seem to have lived for any great length of time. As with many
other things in life a great deal of fuss has been made over the Huia
now that it has gone. If a little of the energy now expended on trying
to trace it had been used in the first place in securing one or two pairs
for the island sanctuaries we might still have had this singular bird
alive to-day.

and local experience proves it second to the Gouldian for delicateness.
Most of our Finches breed in the winter, and consequent egg-binding
is so often the result.
This Finch is no doubt well known to aviculturists, making a
description of plumage and sexes unnecessary.
I placed a pair of newly-caught birds among my mixed collection
in an outdoor aviary 20 X 10 X 8 feet high. They had access to
canary, millett, panicum, hemp, linseed, rape, the usual greens, and
soft food. This pair proved extremely active, and inside one month
the cock was observed with a piece of grass in his mouth executing

a grotesque dance on the perch before his partner. His " song " was
very similar to that of the Gouldian. Nesting quickly followed, both
birds assisting in the building with the cock bird the most active and
consistent. Three white eggs were laid and both birds religiously took
turns in incubating. At this time great partiality was shown towards
soft food, which consisted mainly of crushed biscuit, dried flies and
egg yolk.
The nest was constructed of grass, oval in shape with a side entrance,
the cock proving a determined defender of his handiwork. This nest
was built in the centre of a dense tea-tree in the open flight, all sheltered
positions being scorned.
The incubation occupied a fortnight and two eggs only hatched,
the third proving unfertile. The young never looked back, and had
luminous globules on each side of the " gape " similar to the Gouldian.
The parents both fed the young almost entirely on the soft food.
The fledglings, a drab olive green colour, did not show any real sign
of colour until three month of age and did not moult into complete
adult plumage until six months old. Sexes are not distinguishable
with certainty until then. When able to feed themselves they showed
preference for the soft foods.
They are most amusing when worrying the parents for food. They
almost stand on their heads and are most persistent in their efforts.
A peculiar feature with these youngsters was their fascination for the
song of the canaries in the aviary. Immediately a canary commenced
whistling the young Stars would fly and perch in front of the whistler,
deliberately face him and stay there throughout the solo completely
fascinated. From four subsequent nests of youngsters this same
phenomena has occurred.
In rearing the young I placed great reliance in the soft food and,
when the pair immediately nested again, I determined to experiment
and removed all soft food. Two young were hatched and survived one
week only. The parents nested a third time and I returned the soft
food. Four eggs were laid and three youngsters reared. I was astounded
when the pair again nested, this being the fourth time. From three
eggs two young were reared. The same nest was used throughout.
The fourth nest took the birds well into the summer but did not deter

them from again nesting early this winter. To date I have reared five
youngsters from two nests.
As I observed previously every youngster so far reared shows the
same fascination when a canary breaks into song.
The Star is a consistent bather, never missing its morning plunge.
It is also fond of cuttlefish and green-seeded grasses.
I would be interested to hear the opinion of other aviculturists,
but I am convinced that soft food is necessary to breed and rear this
species.

On my return from Ecuador I found everyone too engrossed in
the War for me to think of any further collecting for the time being,
so after a short rest I offered my services to the War Office,- but did
not receive much encouragement. As time went on and I heard no
more about it, I accepted a post offered to me in Bolivia through
a friend in the Foreign Office. Another man (a Canadian) had been
selected to go with me, and when we met I found he had been a table
companion on my journey home from South America. He was a mining
engineer who had thrown up a good post in Colombia, and had come
home to join up, and like me had offered his services and heard no more
about it. Now Bolivia, with the exception of two of the Guianas and
Paraguay, was the only country in South America I had not visited,
therefore I jumped at the offer. Perhaps I ought not to include what
I am about to write under the heading of this article, as I was not
then a collector in the true sense of the word.
The usual way of entry into the country is via one of the Peruvian
or Chilian ports on the Pacific coast, but we had been requested to
go by a much less-known route through Buenos Aires, the Plate Biver,
Paraguay, and part of Western Brazil to Puerto Suarez, a small outlet
Bolivia owns on the upper waters of the Bio Paraguay. Bolivia is

like two distinct countries : the high Andean region called the Alti
Plano, which contains all the towns of any importance ; and the vast
Eastern province, all low lying and exceedingly unhealthy, stretching
right away to the Amazon. Few people know or ever visit this part,
and I see a writer who was recently there has called it the " Green
Hell ", Bolivia. It is mainly unexplored and inhabited by wild Indian
tribes, most of them very savage. The greater part is primeval forest
with some scrubby pampa.
The Plate River is not interesting, but when one reaches the
Argentine town of Corrientes the river takes a sharp bend to the right,
and from thereon is called the Parana, while directly in front is the
narrower Rio Paraguay. It is here where the interest begins, as from
now on one sees alligators in ever-increasing numbers daily. These
are not in hundreds, but thousands, a sight such as I had never met
with in any other part of the world and had not imagined could exist
in these days. Where the banks were narrow, they were practically
on the top of each other, never troubling to enter the water as the
steamer passed, if anything going higher up to escape the wash. The
banks are low and the country flat, so an extensive view is to be had
on both sides. In the wet season the river overflows its banks, leaving
lake-like expanses of water which gradually dry up. Around these
the alligators lie in thousands, and it was a common sight to see cattle
standing about among them, also hosts of Tree Ducks, Herons, Roseate
Spoonbills, and many other species of wading birds. This breed of
alligators seems to be comparatively harmless for reasons I do not
understand. Several times I saw fishermen standing in the water quite
near to huge specimens. Just before we reached Asuncion, the capital
of Paraguay, I noticed a small beach on the outskirts of the city,
on which a number were sunning themselves, so after we landed I lost
no time in finding my way there. I sat down and watched them for
some time, and then went forward to see how near they would let
me approach them. This was 8 feet before the nearest moved off
to the water. Farther up the river it was no uncommon sight to see
some basking in the sun with mouths wide open and almost obscured
by clouds of butterflies attracted to them. One could write pages on
these reptiles alone, and later I had much to do with them in Bolivia,

where we had another breed outwardly the same but as fierce as these
were tame.
The Rio Paraguay is a paradise for the ornithologist and, to those
who during our winters go in search of nature study, no better trip
could be recommended. From Buenos Aires to Asuncion the journey
can be made in really luxurious steamers with no discomforts whatever,
but at the latter place a change has to be made for the upper part
of the river to steamers less comfortable, but still quite good, but it
is from here the journey is even more interesting as birds of a more
tropical nature are encountered daily and all day. It was a sight to
see the Ducks alone, returning in their thousands as evening came on,
also flocks of Parrots, Parrakeets, and Macaws ; while many Herons,
Roseate Spoonbills, and other waders were seldom out of sight along
the banks. Those who have never seen these Spoonbills in a mid
state have not the slightest idea how beautiful a flock of these birds
can be in the brilliant sunlight, perhaps standing among, or even on
the backs of, alligators. Their rose and carmine plumage, which fades
in captivity, is one of the loveliest sights I know, so intense in colour.
In many parts trees line the banks and among these may be recognized
many Toucans, Nanday Conures, and a great variety of other birds,
while nearer the water Jacamerops (probably aurea) was sometimes
seen to dart out and catch insects on the wing. Darters called here
by their Brazilian name anhingas (pronounced anyingas) are everywhere
on the water and on all logs drying their outstretched wings. These
birds look particularly snakelike, especially when swimming with the
body under the water, and only the long neck above. Often across the
pampa flocks of Rheas were observed, so near sometimes that several
were shot from the deck of the steamer. On these occasions a boat
was lowered and sailors went on shore to recover the bodies. The
liver appeared to be considered a delicacy, and was more than once
served at the saloon table, but I did not sample it so cannot say what
it is like. The sailors ate the rest of the body and plucked out all the
feathers for making the dusting brushes which are such a feature of
all homes in the southern part of the continent.
Of animals we saw many deer drinking at the water's edge, and
capybaras, called here carpinchos , a few tapirs, and a fox or two.

Walter Goodfellow--Some Reminiscences of a Collector 417
We were held up for two weeks at Asuncion by a strike of the
river workers. So I took the opportunity to visit the celebrated Iguassu
falls on the Parana, going by train as far as Encarnacion. Here I came
across for the first time a bird many readers must have admired in
the bird house at the Zoo, namely, the White-capped Tanager
(Stephanophorus leucocephalus). During one day I counted nearly
twenty in parties of three or four, always in bushes, or sitting on the
topmost twigs where their beautiful blue plumage looked conspicuously
brilliant. Popas, too, were numerous, but as I did not shoot any birds
on the journey, I cannot give the species. As in all parts of South
America, at every village, or ranch, the steamer stopped at, was a
wooden cross in the centre, which may be high or low, but invariably
on the cross bar was fixed at least one, and sometimes more, of the
solid clay nests of the Oven Bird (Funarius rufa). These are never
molested as many superstitious legends are woven around these birds.
At a house I once stayed at in Brazil an Oven Bird had built its nest
on the ledge of the first floor verandah railing which people used every
day. When the birds begin to build or renovate old nests, it is known
the wet season will very soon end. I watched a pair at one place build
a perfectly-formed porch-like projection over the entrance to an old
nest they were repairing ; and at another add a second storey, a very
unusual thing, but this belonged to another species (F. cinnamomeus ).
These nests are replicas on a small scale of the ovens built outside all
country houses.
A ground bird, common around some of the ranches we called at,
was the Seed Snipe (Thinocorus rumicivorus). I had only met with
this before in Chile, where it is called chatadera, and from whence
I brought a number home alive, several of which lived for a long time
in the western aviaries of the Zoo. Some may still remember them,
for I believe none have been here since. They are fascinating little
birds, bearing little resemblance to the ordinary Snipe. It is a pity
more are not imported.
I believe all the country along the Paraguay River used to be a
great resort for Egrets, and formed a very conspicuous feature of the
landscape, especially where the banks border along the Gran Chaco.
Alas ! now they are only conspicuous by their absence. For this we

have to blame the ladies who coveted their fairy-like plumes for hats.
Still in all the stores and wayside places, the announcement in Spanish,
" Egret plumes bought here," may be seen. Numerous were the stories
of the money men made out of the trade in former days. May the
fashion never come in again, and so leave us the few that remain.
Corumba, the terminus for all river steamers, is the farthest western
outpost of Brazil, and quite a nice little garrison town for such distant
wilds. From here launches can go still farther up where it is called
the San Lorenzo. In fact, during the wet season it would be possible
to connect by canoe with other rivers flowing north and finally reach
the Amazon via the Rio Madeira at Manaos. To those who would like
to make a journey through Paraguay such as I have described, I would
suggest going in at Buenos Aires, up to Porto Esperan 9 a, which is a
day south of Corumba. From here there is a railway right across Brazil
to Sao Paulo. There are two or three trains a week, and the journey
takes several days, travelling only by day. Accommodation with
baths, etc., is provided at the stations. Or, one could go in by Sao
Paulo via Rio or Santos, but coming down the river, of course, takes
much less time than going up and does not allow so much time for
enjoying the river scenes.
From Puerto Suarez, 7 miles beyond Corumba, we started on
our long ride of some hundreds of miles to Santa Cruz de la Sierra
at the foot of the great range of the Andes. It was then towards the
end of the dry season and we suffered much from thirst, sometimes
going two days without meeting any water except of such a quality
undrinkable for human beings. Two water bags had been stolen on
the river boat, so we could only carry a little with us. During the
wet season much of this country is impassable. It is almost uninhabited
except by wild Indians, whose fresh tracks we sometimes came across.
Birds we seldom saw except Rheas, the large crimson Macaws (A.
macao), and ground birds consisting of several species of Tinamous,
Cariamas, Courlans, and an. occasional odd pair of Screamers ( Chauna
cristata). Most of the country is pampa with more or less scrub and
scattered trees, while other parts reminded one of Northern India,
with untold thousands of very tall slender fan palms. Several times
we saw pumas, and once a jaguar, and a black one at that. One of

the pumas was stalking a flock of Darwin Bheas and was so intent on
its quarry, warily approaching them through the grass, that I was quite
close to it before it heard me. Another time we came suddenly upon
a female with two cubs. The pumas here were grey, whereas those
I met with later in the forest regions were all tawny. Once during
this long journey we stayed the night at a small settlement surrounded
by a marvellously-constructed stockade as a protection against Indians
who often attacked them in " howling mobs " as the head man informed
us. This was under the shadow of one of the most remarkable and
isolated mountains I have seen. Several times we encountered a veritable
snowstorm of common white butterflies in such incredible numbers
as to cause our animals to all but get out of control. At times it was
almost impossible to see through them ; one of these " storms " lasted
several hours, and at times I could not see my companion through
them, although he was only a few yards ahead. They all seemed to be
travelling in one direction.
After Santa Cruz we still had another six days' ride to Concepcion
in the province of Nuflo de Chavez. Here I left my companion as this
small, isolated town (?) was to be our headquarters. After a few days'
rest I continued on for a week longer in a north-easterly direction.
A day after Concepcion I left the pampa country behind and quite
suddenly entered the primeval forest which continued on without a
break until I arrived at a small clearing called Esperanza. It was
a curious sensation there, for I had left the muleteers and my baggage
behind when I left camp early on the last morning. During the night
vampire bats had attacked some of the animals and these were in
a sorry state, with clotted blood all down the withers. Two others
had broken loose and strayed, so while the men had gone to look for
them I rode on ahead alone, after being told just to follow the very
ill-defined trail. Early in the afternoon I came to a branch trail which
I had not been told about, so I took one at hazard, but as the day wore
on without any visible break in the denseness of the trees I began
to think I had taken the wrong turning. At length I thought I saw
a brighter gleam, and after a few minutes I quite suddenly found the
open sky above me. It was a joyous feeling after being in that green
gloom for days without the sight of a human habitation. Here I made

my home for four years, only leaving it for a month during the worst
of the wet season once a year, which was the only time I heard my
own language spoken, and this in war time too, when I was yearning
for news from home of friends and relations at the War. Letters took
three to four months to reach me, and often newspapers failed to arrive
at all. Some letters written at this time arrived all together a year
after the War had ended, and when two of the writers had long been
killed.
After my return home I came across Conan Doyle's Lost Continent ,
which gave a small map showing where this lost part was supposed
to be in South America. This was exactly more or less where Esperanza
stood, not far from the Rio Itenez, which divided us from the state
of Matto Cross, in Brazil.
I had thought this would be a wonderful field for birds, but in this
I was disappointed for birds were very seasonal here, and many species
seemed to stay but a short time with us ; besides I had met almost
all of them before in other parts of the Amazonian basin. We had
a long dry season and a very wet one, and it was only between these
two seasons, corresponding to spring, that many species with a few
exceptions were about. Two of these exceptions were a small Ground
Dove (Chamcepelia) and the Yellow-collared Macaw (A. auricollis), both
of which left before the dry season ended. Where they went to I have
no idea ; probably farther south. In the clearing were a number of
small water holes and some swampy ground never dry. It was to
these the Macaws came in their hundreds morning and evening, when
every small tree around the damp parts was literally covered with
them, wherever a foothold was to be had. The Doves were all over
the clearing and invaded the vicinity of my house, even at times
venturing inside. I kept a half dozen of the Macaws for a long time
but, shortly before I was due to come home, four of them escaped
while I had gone up to Concepcion, so it only left the two which I gave
to the Zoo, where one of them still lives at the time of writing. These,
I believe, are the only ones ever brought alive to Europe. It will be
seen by what I have said that this is not a rare bird where they come
from, but I do not know who but an hombre loco, as the Spaniards say,
would ever take the trouble to bring home live birds from such an

out-of-the-way part of the world. I often think still of the difficulties
I had with these and a few other birds I brought at the same time,
and when I was racked with fever for a great part of the journey,
finding an outlet down to the Amazon.
Blue-and-yellow Macaws, Rice Grackles ( Cassidix oryzivora ), Guira,
and Ani ( Crotophaga ) Cuckoos were with us all the year round, and
conspicuous because of their numbers and keeping to the open. Every
thorn bush in the clearing held one or more Cuckoo's nests. The Rice
Grackles came among the poultry and shared their maize, and were
indefatigable hunters of ticks among the cattle. Although so sleek
and glossy, these birds are not a favourite of mine as they are great
tyrants to all small birds and even to others as large as themselves.
Whether they attack young chickens I cannot say, but hens with broods
always chased them, while others took no exception to them. They are
extremely suspicious birds and, although constantly around my house,
were most difficult to catch whichever method was tried. On killing
days, when bullocks were slaughtered to make charqui (dried meat),
two or three boys had to patrol along the lines where the meat was
hung out to dry to keep off the Turkey Buzzards who watched every
opportunity to steal it. They are particularly persistent and daring
and, although I tried every ruse I could think of to keep them off,
they always baffled me.
At the end of the dry season came the first rains which lasted two
weeks on and off, followed by two months of fine weather with light
showers only before the heavy rains finally set in in January. This
was the spring time when many birds returned to us and began to
nest. Trees burst into bloom (although many of the most beautiful
flowered in the dry season) which attracted many Humming Birds,
for it was only at this time of the year we saw any at all. These seemed
all forest species and never came beyond the edge of the clearing ;
although I had many flowers around the house I never saw a Hummer
come to them. That exceedingly beautiful Tyrant Flycatcher (Muscivora
tyrannus) was very welcome to the clearing, as they remained constantly
around the house, sitting on the roof and fences, performing their
graceful evolutions in the air so I was never tired of watching them,
especially when two males were sparring in the air together with their

long forked tails extended to their utmost capacity. Where they
nested (if at all with us) I never found out, but certainly much courting
went on in the air.
When our people (Indians and half-cast Indians) knew of my
fondness for birds, they brought me many nestlings during the season,
so in the end I had a great variety of pets about the place : in fact,
I often thought that without some such hobby one would have gone
mad down there, or taken to drink, or some other vice, as had my
predecessor. Such birds as Curassows, Penelopes, and Guans and a
few others, had their full liberty. At one time I had no less than eight
White-crested Penelopes (Pijpile cristata), which I find particularly
decorative birds, all hand-reared. To see them stretched out on the
floor of the verandah sunning themselves was a beautiful sight, the
sheen on their plumage showing to full advantage, but then they are
grace itself at all times, with large, appealing eyes. The wall of forest
which enclosed the clearing was not far off, and whenever I went out
and whistled they flew to me at once in a long line like small planes
without a movement of the wings and alighted on my shoulders and
outstretched arms. This is certainly one of the most delightful birds
to have at liberty around a house, and it is a pity they are not more
often imported here and better known, as I am sure they would not
fail to become popular especially with those who have country homes.
They are by no means rare, and have a wide range in South America.
The same applies to the smaller Guans, although they are not so
beautiful. On the Rio Napo, one of the headwaters of the Amazon,
I once had an adult Guan (Ortalis guttata) brought to me which was
so wild I had for my own peace of mind to let it go after about a week.
The Indian house where I was living was on the bank of the river,
but at the back was a large clearing more or less. In the evening I was
in the habit of walking round here with my gun, and, when watching
some birds in a high tree, a large bird flew from somewhere and settled
on a nearby stump. This was no less than my untamable Guan, which
I recognized at once by one curiously-twisted feather in the tail. It
had then been at liberty for some days and had certainly not forgotten
who fed it, and no doubt missed its bananas, so I hurried back to
fetch some. It would not take them from my hand, but as soon as

they were laid on another stump it ate them at once and then flew off.
This was repeated every day, and it was always waiting for me, and
in a very short time was feeding from my hands. Gradually, I induced
it to meet me nearer and nearer the hut ; very timidly at first, but
in the end whenever it wanted food it came right in if no one else
was there. The day before I left I caught it up again and took it down
the river with me to another village some days away and turned it
loose again there, where it stayed around the house roosting in a nearby
tree at night. One day when I came in the Indians told me it had
been carried off by a Hawk, and showed me the feathers lying about
where the struggle had taken place. The next morning or evening,
I forget which, as I was passing through the far side of the village,
came my half-plucked and badly-clawed bird from under an old hut.
Although in a bad way I was delighted to have it back again as if it were
risen from the dead. Probably the Hawk had taken more than it could
well fly off with, and dropped it. This bird eventually came with me
to England and lived for some years. Guans cross readily with some
breeds of domestic poultry, and are much esteemed for this purpose
in some parts of South America. The males have a curious crow some-
thing like a rooster's. The Napo, Coca, and Suno Indians all called
this bird guataracu.

I hope people will not get fed up with articles about the Crossoptilons,
but as I flatter myself to have procured the original parents of all the Blue
Crossoptilons existing now in Europe, I hope our members will forgive
me for making some further remarks on this handsome pheasant.
How I obtained the first lot for M. Delacour in 1929, I have already
described in our Magazine. I may add that since 1905 I had tried again
and again to obtain this species, but only in 1929 was success accom-
plished. The pair from which Mr. Stefani bred so successfully this year
was brought over from Shanghai to Marseilles in my personal care.
I picked it from a lot of about thirty-five brought to Shanghai by the
Chinese servant of a friend of mine who did collecting work for an

Alex Hampe--Once More the Blue Crossoptilon
American museum and who had sent his boy to Kansu to obtain the
Pheasants. The faithful Chinaman had collected about seventy birds,
but about half of them succumbed on the way to Shanghai. The
remainder arrived in a most miserable condition, most of them were
almost bare of feathers and about eight died soon after arrival. The
others, placed in a very large aviary, soon picked up and at the end of
October, 1932, I was able to pack nine pairs and some single cocks for
America, while I took a perfect pair myself via Suez to Marseilles.
Two pairs remained in Shanghai, whether they have bred there, I do
not know. During the long journey my pair behaved in an exemplary
way and never gave me an anxious moment. In the tropics going from
Singapore to Sumatra it was very hot and the Crossoptilons gaped a
bit, but they kept their good appetite and seemed not to suffer half
as much as some Temminck's Tragopans I had with me. All the cages
of my collection had false bottoms and this seems not advisable for
Crossoptilons. Evidently they are used to dig a good deal for their
food and therefore used to scatter all the paddy out of the tin as soon
as I placed it in the cage. Through the bamboo-crating they could
not reach the grains and I had, therefore, to remove the crate and clean
the cage with a little scraper. If I had not been present, I doubt
whether a sailor in charge of the birds would have observed this, and
the birds would have starved. I also surprised the cock one day when
he started to tear the padding of the cage top and to sample the cotton
wool under the lining. I had made this arrangement in order to avoid
bruised heads, but I think it is not advisable for birds with very strong
beaks like Crossoptilons and Impeyans.
Anyhow, I finally landed the pair in the best of condition and I feel
proud to have enriched the European aviaries by this beautiful and
evidently prolific pheasant. Almost all M. Delacour says about the
Blue Crossoptilon is correct, but I am sure he will forgive me if
I contradict him on a few points. He says that a lot of wild-caught
Crossoptilons were brought to California. There were a few wild-caught
birds amongst the lot of my American friend but they all died on the
way to Shanghai. All the others, and also the birds which I obtained
a few years ago, were birds reared in captivity by the Chinese in Kansu.
As mentioned by Mr. Stefani and myself there used to be a great demand

for the tail feathers of Crossoptilon auritum for the hats of high
Mandarins, and later on these feathers were exported in quantities
to Europe and America for millinery purposes. Crossoptilons are not
easy to catch or to shoot, and, to satisfy the demand for the feathers,
the Chinese collected the eggs of the wild birds and hatched them
under domestic hens and later also bred from the birds obtained in
this way. The demand for feathers has died out now but the Chinese
still breed the Pheasant, probably for eating. M. Delacour states
further in the Bulletin of the Societe Nationale d'Acclimatation de
France, that Crossoptilon auritum had not been imported before 1929.
I doubt whether this is correct, for I have an old book before me written
by M. Cronau, of Strasbourg, who, in years gone by was surely the
biggest breeder and one of the greatest authorities on gallinaceous
birds on the Continent. In this book M. Cronau gives a description
of his aviaries and their contents and he states that three of his aviaries
are inhabited by Crossoptilon auritum and three by Crossoptilon man-
churicum, so he must have had our bird. Also in the book Geflugelzucht
(poultry-keeping) by Bruno Duerigen, our Pheasant is correctly
described and must have been known to the author. Anyhow,
Crossoptilon auritum seems to be established now in Europe, and I hope
breeders will do their best not to lose him again.
It is an everlasting regret for me that I have not been able to bring
the White Crossoptilon ( C . tibetanum ) to Europe. I was very near to
success in 1930. One of my Chinese friends went on business to
Tachienlu, a town on the border of Szechuen and Tibet. Naturally,
I asked him to bring me some White Crossoptilons, showed him a
coloured plate of the bird, and gave him detailed prescriptions for
feeding and packing the birds. He really got four birds, but fearing
that he would be robbed of his furs and skins which he had bought
in Tachienlu while travelling back to Shanghai through the Yangtze
Valley, he chose the route for going home via Yunnan, French Indo-
China, and Hong-Kong. It was very hot and in Hanoi his birds died,
and all I got was a few tail feathers. I sincerely hope that others may
be more successful and also bring us the two Impeyans which live in
China. It should not be so difficult to obtain Lophophorus V Huy si,
but I have my grave doubts whether Sclater's Monaul will ever decorate
our aviaries.

HYBRID PARSON AND . MASKED FINCHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991601157894737" page_id="56237666"  page_num="426" year="" vol="">
During August, 1932, I purchased a pair of Masked Finches (Poephila
per sonata) from one of the leading Sydney dealers ; they were placed in
a cage 36 X 24 x 18 inches for acclimatization before turning out into the
Finch aviary.
The birds were in splendid condition on arrival, and being the first of this
species I had kept I spent hours watching them, trying to discover which was
the cock and which the hen. Very shortly they went to nest in the coconut-
shell provided as sleeping quarters and, to my astonishment, the hen laid no
less than eleven eggs ; these unfortunately proved all clear. Shortly after-
wards they went to nest again, this time the nest contained five eggs ; both
birds shared the duties of incubation, in fact, throughout, both were on the
nest together ; as these eggs also were clear and the weather was now warmer
I turned the Finches into the aviary, where they soon built a nest and sat for
some time. I am unable to say how many eggs were laid this time, but nothing
eventuated.
During March of this year, whilst cleaning out, I discovered a nest con-
taining young in the grass, about 18 inches from the ground, soon satisfying
myself they were young Masked Finches. Shortly afterwards three young
Masked Finches were winging their way about the aviary. But stop ! there is
something " different " about them. Ah ! that's it, the bib on each of the three
is slightly larger than on the parents. I remember the eleven eggs in one nest,
and that the eggs in both nests examined were clear, and also both birds sat
side by side--little things perhaps, but taken together, what ? Can it be
I have been trying to breed with two hens, and that the young are hybrids ?
Later I notice a cock Parson Finch (Poephila cincta) displaying before one
of the Masked Finches. This cock by the way is devoted to a hen Zebra
Finch, and they have had several nests with an occasional fertile egg, but
none hatched.
At four months the young birds are definitely proved to be fathered by
the Parson Finch, the bib being now much larger, about mid-way in size
between the Masked and the Parson, while the head is flushed with the grey
of the latter, the beak is a muddy chocolate hue, rather difficult to describe ;
it may, however, change colour later, but am doubtful.
By the way, have you noticed that the young Australian Finches have
black beaks, later changing to the normal hue of the parents. Has this been
noticed with Finches from other parts of the globe ?

AN ESCAPED VULTURINE GUINEAFOWL

<bodyText confidence="0.9992686" page_id="56237666"  page_num="426" year="" vol="">
Two years ago a brood of young Yulturine Guineafowl was hatched here
very late in the summer. The weather was cold and damp and the young ones
died off very quickly, until only two remained. These seemed stronger, and
survived till they were about three weeks old when they both mysteriously
disappeared one night. They obviously had not died like the others, or we

should have found the bodies, and it was supposed that either a rat had got
into their enclosure and dragged them away or else that they had escaped
through the wire-netting ; in any case, nothing more was heard of them... . .
One day last week I was rung up and told a large unknown bird " like a Pea-
fowl " was feeding with the fowls on a chicken-farm 15 miles away, would
I go over and see what it was ? On arrival I found a large and very healthy -
looking female Vulturine Guineafowl, quite tame and in perfect condition.
As no one except myself in Norfolk keeps these birds I can only suppose
that it is one of the chicks of two years ago which, as we surmised, had escaped
and managed to survive and maintain itself, and had gradually strayed farther
and farther afield till it was captured, as I have said, 15 miles away. It is
remarkable, however, that such a delicate bird, susceptible to cold and
intensely so to frost-bite, should have managed to weather two severe
winters and also to have escaped not only being shot but also, apparently,
being seen or noticed as something unusual for such a long period.

CORMORANT KILLING YOUNG DUCKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996917434782609" page_id="56237667"  page_num="427" year="" vol="">
With regard to Mr. J. Roberts's note in the October number of the
Magazine, querying whether Cormorants attacked other birds in a wild state,
1 think it is highly probable that they occasionally do so if annoyed or incon-
venienced by them, though possibly not with any special idea of killing them.
I remember seeing on the Saltee Islands, off the coast of Wexford, a Cormorant
which was sitting on eggs, amongst a crowd of Guillemots and Razorbills,
repeatedly make vicious stabs with her beak at the latter when they came
too near her nest, and actually leave her eggs and savagely attack a Kittiwake
Gull which had settled on the rock in close proximity to the nest. In
captivity they are distinctly dangerous to other birds. Two specimens which
at different times found a temporary home here on a pond with a lot of
Waterfowl, killed two or three young ducklings which ventured too near ;
on the other hand, a Shag seemed more amenable and I never remember
seeing it interfere with anything, but that may have been merely luck.
Gannets are not to be trusted with Ducks; they are very spiteful on land, but
do not seem to interfere with them in the water. When my father was writing
his monograph on the Gannet we had seven or eight specimens here at different
times for observation purposes, and they killed several Ducks and quite
a number of Waterhens. During the past recent hot summer the White
Fantail Pigeons here would fly down to drink from the Pelicans' pool, the
latter snapped the luckless Pigeons up in a moment and, if not too large,
always swallowed them.

After trying all imaginable kinds of water-fountains and fountain-baths

a gimlet and on the reverse side pierce another blind hole S in. deep, and put
your pliable wire through and hammer the end in the blind hole. When you
have got the exact position of the bottle you can then, by placing whatever
dish or tray you intend to use under the neck of the bottle, saw off the inch
timber to the exact length for the shelf at the bottom. For a bird-bath a 5-in.
seed-pan, which can be got at any market gardeners, is excellent, and you can
cut the length of your wood to allow -J, f, or 1 inch depth of water.
For a drinking fountain a shrimp-pot answers, but in this case # in. clearance
is ample. For a seed-hopper a bit of beading round the bottom shelf answers.
In this case do not have your shelf more than 4 inches square, and both for
a seed-hopper or a drinking fountain do not allow more than in. space from
the bottle-neck to the bottom of the tray or shrimp-pot. If one is using
larger seeds a larger necked bottle will have to be used. There is only one
snag in using a whisky bottle, it is a bit slow to fill with seed. But one of the
cheap funnels got at the 6d. bazaars, if put over the gas-jet for a few moments
allowing the smaller end of the funnel to drop off, allows of a larger hole in
the funnel used in filling the whisky-bottle. I use a pair of square-ended pliers
with J in. nose to bend my wire.
One great advantage of using the inverted bottle is that it allows of
a separate bottle for each kind of seed or mixture, and you see at a glance
what seed is going. Again, if the seed-tray is small, it does not allow of the
birds getting in the tray and scattering the seed. Where I first saw the idea
only one or two pairs of birds were in each aviary and three-ply wood was used
with small medicine-bottles, but as I have thirty to forty birds in each of
my aviaries I find that the whisky-bottle is more useful, and the birds scrapping
to get to the food-tray flap their wings and thus blow away the seed-husks
that may be dropped in the tray.

WHITE -FACED WHISTLING TREE-DUCK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987647388888889" page_id="56237669"  page_num="429" year="" vol="">
I have had a pair of White-faced Whistling Tree-Ducks (Dendrocygna
viduata) for eight years. They have been a very friendly pair, and when I go
to the aviary where they are kept and whistle they will usually fly to me.
I was very surprised this year to find the Duck sitting on a nest of three eggs.
The next morning I found four eggs and, as I thought she might desert the
nest, I took three of the eggs and put them in a nest under a Bantam and one
has hatched out. The little Duck is now about three weeks old and growing
famously. I send you a photograph of him and also of his parents. Since
I took these eggs the Duck has laid some more, in all fifteen, and, as I thought,
the Duck forsook her nest after sitting on it for ten days, I therefore removed
all the eggs and put them under another hen, and now have six
Ducklings, which I am in hopes of being able to rear.
I shall be pleased to hear if this is the first time these Ducks have been
bred in this country. I believe they have been bred in captivity in the States
and on the Continent, but have not heard of them being bred in Great Britain.

BREEDING HABITS OF RED-LEGGED PARTRIDGES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9964450625" page_id="56237669"  page_num="429" year="" vol="">
It would appear that the Red-legged Partridges ( Alecloris) have the peculiar
habit of producing two clutches of eggs at each laying period, one of which is
incubated by the hen in the usual manner, the other being taken charge of by
the cock who incubates the eggs and rears the brood. Instances of this have
been recorded in the magazine for August and September last, the species
being Alectoris petrosa and A. Cypriotes. Now Captain Reeve tells me that
people in his neighbourhood believe that the common Red-legged or " French 55
Partridge (A. rufa) lays two lots of eggs, and from his own experience he
knows their breeding habits to be very peculiar, and that there may be three
or four days between the laying of eggs in a given nest, and a week or more
after finishing before incubation commences, all of which points to two nests
at once, but as he says, " how is one to absolutely prove it ? " It should not
be difficult to prove with a single pair of these birds in a large enough aviary.
Anyhow, there is evidently something strange in the nesting habits of this
group of birds, and it behoves all who have an opportunity to study them to
do so.--D. S-S.

SUCCESS WITH GRASS PARRAKEETS IN CALIFORNIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991315" page_id="56237669"  page_num="429" year="" vol="">
Several articles have appeared recently in the Avicudtural Magazine
on the breeding of the Bourke's Grass Parrakeet, and as my experience with
these birds seem to be a little out of lino in some respects, it may be of interest.
Last year I procured two cock Bourke's from Dr. Hamilton. One of them
was in bad condition upon arrival in Chicago, where Mr. Metzger gave them
a rest and succeeded in getting him back to what appeared to be normal,
but after some three months he died. The other I had traded with Dr. Patrick
for one of the Tavistock birds which was supposed to be a hen. I then turned
this bird into a pen with a hen Blue-wing and a cock Elegant, and
immediately it mated with the hen Blue-wing. I then secured the other bird

from Dr. Patrick, which in the meantime had killed its mate, and put it in the
pen with my cock, who proceeded to attempt to kill it, and would have
succeeded had I not interfered. They were then put in adjoining pens for two
weeks, after which they were turned together without further trouble.
I had anticipated considerable difficulty in furnishing a nest-box that would
be acceptable to them and, as a result, went to some trouble in building several
that I thought might be accepted and just for good measure I hung up an
old Budgie-box and, of course, the unexpected happened and she went to
nest in that one. Four eggs were laid, four young hatched and reared. Before
I could clean out the box she started laying again, and I was forced to remove
the eggs to clean out the box, this time seven eggs, all of which hatched,
rearing six. The one she lost was hatched so late that the older ones trampled
it. After the young ones were hatched I examined the nest-box every other
day, removing it from the nail and standing it on the floor, removing the
young when about ten days old and cleaning the second nest, and they didn't
seem to mind. The young are all very tame, several of them will fly to my
hand or shoulder when I am feeding. The first few days she fed little other
than greens, after which " hempseed ", of which she had an unlimited supply,
was fed. Canary and large yellow millet was available.
I am aware that hemp-seed is frowned on by many breeders, especially
when fed to these rarer Grass Parrakeets, and their experience no doubt
justifies it, but I wonder if the climate and not the hemp may have something
to do with it. Three years ago I procured three pairs of Elegants from
Lord Tavistock, and from them I have raised and now have fifty-four birds,
all reared on hempseed, and they are all in perfect plumage and health.
Our climate here on the south-west coast is very constant, seldom going above
90* in the summer or below 50* in the winter. I speak of the immediate coast
(I am four blocks from the ocean).
My aviaries are somewhat different from the average " chicken-run "
type. They are built in one unit about 40 feet square, divided up into pens
that average 12 x 6 X 8 feet high. A high dense hedge surrounds them
with the exception of the one entrance gate. A large pepper-tree overhangs
them all, thus giving the birds natural seclusion. Punning water and young
barley are at all times in each pen.
Another feed item that I never use is hulled oats. This food may be all
right when it is fresh, and by that I mean a few hours after it is hulled, but,
after a number of middle-men get through " treating " it to keep out the
worms, I claim it is no food for a delicate bird.

By the Hon. Anthony Chaplin
The essentially new-world family of the Trochilidse is in many
respects allied to the Swifts, although this is more apparent in the
nestling, which has a short beak and wide gape, than in the adult,
and the tropical Palm-swifts show the relationship more strongly
than the typical species.
The Humming Birds have always been surrounded by mystery
and romance, which is due hardly less to the fact that they inhabit
such a magnificent country than to their beauty of form and incredible
swiftness. According to the religious belief of the Mexicans, Targamiqui,
the spouse of the god of war, conducted the souls of those warriors,
who had died in the defence of the gods, into the mansions of the sun
and there transformed them into Humming Birds. The native names,
in like manner, reflect the impression these wonders of creation have
made upon the minds of men, and such a one as " Tresses of the
daystar " is certainly more imaginative, if less compact, than our
trivial name for the family.
The country which boasts the most spectacular forms and the
greatest variety of species is that portion of the great Andean chain
which lies almost under the Equator. These luxuriant slopes are
indeed a fit setting for the jewels that abound thereon.
And far above the more sheltered regions Humming Birds are
found up to the very edge of the line of perpetual snow. Humboldt

The Hon. Anthony Chaplin--Humming Birds
writes of this elevated plateau as follows : " Everywhere around, the
confines of the forest are encircled by broad bands of social plants, as
the delicate Aralia, the Thibandia, and the myrtle-leaved Andromeda ;
whilst the Alpine Rose, the magnificent Befaria, weaves a purple girdle
round the spiry peaks. In the cold regions of the paramos , which is
continually exposed to the fury of storms and winds, we find that
flowering shrubs, and herbaceous plants bearing large and variegated
blossoms, have given place to' the monocotyledons, whose slender
spikes constitute the sole covering of the soil. . . . Where the naked
trachyte rock pierces the grassy turf, and penetrates into those higher
strata of air, which are supposed to be less charged wdth carbonic
acid, we meet only with plants of an inferior organization, as lichens,
lecideas, and the brightly coloured dust-like lepraria, scattered around
in circular patches. Islets of fresh-fallen snow, varying in form and
extent, arrest the last feeble traces of vegetable development, and to
these succeeds the region of perpetual snow." And at the very edge
of this desolate region on Chimborazo is found a lovely Humming Bird,
the Hill-star Oreotrochilus chimborazo, and so do many more of these
peaks possess their particular species. These Alpine birds have been
observed feeding on minute insects for which they search among the
lichens where the snow has been dispersed by the wind or melted by
the sun. The farther we proceed from the Equator the fewer are the
species to be met with. Nevertheless, these fly north to breed in sub-
Arctic North America, and one, for some inexplicable cause, favours
for the same purpose the dreary dripping woods of Tierra del Fuego.
Of outlying habitats the most curious is the island of Juan Fernandez
in the Pacific about four hundred miles from the coast of Chili.
In such a vast family as that of the Trochilidce it is not to be wondered
at that the variety of form is very considerable, the largest being
equal in size to the European Swift while the smallest is comparable
to a bee. Every conceivable length and curvature of bill is to be
found, from that of Docimastes, which exceeds its owner's length, to
the exceedingly short organ of Rhamphomicrum , which has an almost
Swallow-like head. The greatest extremes of curvature are found
between Eutoxeres and Avocettula, for while the bill of the former
curves downwards to form a semi-circle, that of the latter is upturned

at the tip. Moreover, in some species the edges of the mandibles are
smooth while in others again they are finely serrated. This extent of
divergence from the typical form is not found in the old-world honey-
suckers, the Nectariniidce and the Meliphagidce, and is only approached
by the South American Wood-hewers (. Dendrocolaptidce ), a point which
shows the very great antiquity of the family. There is no doubt that
the Sun-birds are meant to perform the same services in the natural
economy of the old world that the Humming Birds do in the new,
although the latter are so vastly more specialized.
New light has to a modest extent been thrown upon the Humming
Birds by their behaviour in captivity. We find that they are not
the uniform whole that the old writers would have us believe. For
example, the little Ruby and Topaz, represented in the plate,
is very much less intelligent than the still smaller White-throated
Sapphire or the Brazilian Emerald ; moreover it is less active and
more temperamental, while its vocal utterance, unlike theirs, is confined
to a short patterned squeak, such as is made by a badly-fitting door.
It has been said that the different species occasionally sleep hanging
head downwards like bats. This, I may say, is sometimes the case,
but is due to misfortune rather than to any particular intention on the
part of the bird. It so happens that, after an especially active period,
an individual will sometimes fall into a state of deep sleep " from
which ", as Gould says, " it is not easily aroused " ; if, at such a
moment, there comes a sudden strong gust of wind the bird will over-
balance and remain hanging to its perch, in which unenviable position
it is obliged to exist until it has had time to regain its senses. I am
convinced that Humming Birds catch insects only in the air, and
spiders only as they dangle from a web. By experimenting I find
that all the individuals I have possessed are unable to pick any form
of insect or spider off a twig and that their tongues are incapable of
sucking up minute insects from flowers, unless it be that the honey
contains truly microscopic forms. Goss says his tame Polytmus in
Jamaica imbibed ants with the honey, but I feel that either he must
have failed to make a close enough observation or that his particular
species differs very considerably from those which I have been able
to experiment upon.

434 F. E. Blaauw--The Breeding of the Black-winged Andean Goose
Both species represented in the plate lived out of doors for a con-
siderable period. The Swallow-tail escaped and was at large for six
weeks ; it was then caught and returned to me not much the worse
for its adventure. The Ruby and Topaz lived in a small all-open
aviary for two months, until it finally escaped through the bars of a
cage in which it had been placed temporarily.
It is neither cold nor sudden changes of temperature that necessarily
prove fatal to the majority of Humming Birds, but they are very easily
upset internally by unsuitable nourishment. It is too much to
expect any bird to endure the combination of a sudden climatic
and dietetic change, such as it is forced to undergo on the Atlantic
between South America and Europe, without it showing some sign
of harmful effect. But I believe that, if the bird is reasonably fit on
arrival, it is worth while spending a week's toil catching small hedge
spiders on which to feed it, for once its natural standard of health
is re-established it can be subjected to a less complicated treatment.
The only individual ( Chlorestes notatus) I possess of the original spring
consignment (the others having been given way or having escaped)
is so robust, owing, I consider, to its treatment on arrival, that it
will stand 45* F. without ruffling a feather and is a veritable atom of
ceaseless energy " from dawn till dewy eve ".
I think that unless aviculturists can spare the time to give each
bird individual attention they had better leave Humming Birds alone,
and the man who keeps his birds solely for the show bench has no
hope of success with these little creatures.

F. E. Blaauw--The Breeding of the Black-winged Andean Goose 435
of 1931, I got an offer from a dealer in Hamburg of two pairs [true
pairs, as he said) and when I bought them, I indeed did get the, so
long vainly promised, true pairs.
The females are, as is well known, exactly like the males in plumage,
but are a good deal smaller and have a different voice. The first females
I remember to have seen were those I saw stuffed in the Museum of
Buenos Aires in 1911, and I also saw chicks in down there, in their
white and black livery.
Afterwards, a pair got to the London Zoo, and under the good
care of Mr. Seth-Smith, a chick was born there, which, I believe, was
figured in the Field. I saw wild birds of this species near a mountain
lake in southern Chile in the Maritime Andes between Los Sauces and
Puren in 1911. There was quite a gathering of those geese at the
spot mentioned, and some beautiful Black-faced Ibises (Theristicus
melanops ), and some Cayenne Lapwings enhanced the beauty of the
sight in those splendid surroundings. The geese when flying struck
me at once as being different from the, to me, familiar Magellanic
Geese, as they were much shorter and heavier to look at, although
their flight was strong enough, and when they came nearer it was
easy enough to identify them. The birds I got from Hamburg were
in good health, but very badly feathered ; probably the result of the
long voyage from Bolivia, where they came from. They were extremely
tame and the males had an amusing way of puffing themselves up
whilst the females cackled at their side. After the moult, when the
flight feathers had been renewed, I found that they were very expert
flyers (they were kept in a large covered-up place), and that they
liked to perch on a small brick house that was in the enclosure. They
would walk up to the wall of the house and then fly up almost vertically
to the roof. If I should come near their enclosure whilst they were
sitting on the roof they would always fly down to me, extending their
legs well forward when they landed, only just clear of the wire-netting,
and then the showing-off would begin.
After I had had my birds a few months the dealer, Mr. Fochelmann,
wrote to me to say that he had several more specimens and hoped that
I would also buy those. As I chanced to have to go to Germany about
that time I resolved to go by Hamburg and have a look at the birds

first. I found them to be in fairly good health although in bad plumage,
but as it had taken too many years to get my wish of having a flock
of those birds realized, I bought the thirteen of them and had them
sent to Grooilust. Three died after I obtained them, and I parted with
three pairs, so that in the end I had four pairs of healthy birds in all.
Of those four pairs, two pairs nested last spring in the beginning
of June. One female laid nine eggs and the other one six eggs. After
they had sat on them a couple of weeks I took the eggs away, put
the nine eggs under a broody turkey hen, and the six under a
common hen.
After thirty days of incubation, under the geese themselves and
substitutes, six chicks hatched under the turkey hen and five under
the common hen, the other eggs being infertile. One gosling died soon
after hatching. The chicks in down were beautiful things, marked
very intensively black and white as is visible on the accompanying
photographs, and both bills and legs were also black. They were
hatched on 30th June and 4th July. The eggs I may mention as being
dirty white.
When first hatched there is a golden-yellow glow on the down
of their heads which, however, disappears after a week or so, leaving
the head white and black like the rest of the body, and it is a curious
coincidence that the newly-hatched chicks of the Abyssinian Blue-
winged Goose ( Cyanochen cyanopterus), a species which, I am told,
also lives near lakes in the mountains, have the same yellow glow on
their heads during the first days of their lives.
The goslings were very active and strong, and grew very well, so
that at the age of three weeks the black legs began to turn red.
About 30th July, little greyish feathers began to grow on the
shoulders and white ones on the sides. On 13th August the legs
were mostly red, whilst the bills were still black and the birds were
strongly feathering. On 21st August some birds began to show the
red on their bills, and on the 11th October the bills were mostly red,
although not so clear as in adult birds. The legs at this time were
almost entirely red, and the birds had almost attained the size of the
adults and were entirely covered with feathers. This first feather
dress is almost exactly like that of the adults, the only difference

being that the shoulder feathers which are, especially in male birds,
almost pure white marked with black stripes in the adults, are mostly
brownish grey in the immature birds, whilst the black markings are not
so well defined. Even the glossy purple mirror in the wings is there,
although slightly duller.
Of the ten chicks only one died, so that one can say that they are
easy to rear.
On the last photo shown here two grey geese are visible with mottled
white heads. Those are young Emperor Geese moulting their grey first
plumage heads into the white heads of the adult birds.
They were reared by another foster-mother, but are great friends
with the Black-winged Geese.

By Mrs. Wharton-Tigar
In April last I bought a pair of Vinaceous Fire-finches ( Estrilda
vinacea), and had very little hope of their living, for the cock especially
was very fragile ; however, during the first glorious spell of weather,
I risked putting them in an aviary where they quickly recovered, and
in July, they were in glorious condition, so I placed them alone in an
open shelter. About the middle of August they seemed interested in
a large bundle of seeding grasses placed against the wire, close to the
door ; they were very secretive over it all, and I saw very little of
the nest-building, but supplied plenty of soft hay and feathers. Soon
afterwards I noticed one bird was always in the nest, unless any
strangers were about, and then both were to be seen in the aviary,
which is about 6x4 feet and is the open shelter run to one of
my small aviaries.
. On one occasion, after having several visitors, I thought they had
deserted, so put my finger in the nest and felt (I am almost sure) four
eggs. They were due to hatch, counting twelve days, about the 5th or
6th September, and so, a day or two before this, I commenced supplying
tiny maggots, four or five mealworms (cut in half) a day, and
insectivorous mixture (sponge cake dried, and eggs and flies, made
crumbly with grated carrot). I also got some fresh ants' eggs from

438 Mrs. Wharton-Tigar--Breeding the Vinaceous Fire-finch
Germany, but I did not notice that they eat them very much. I gave
hard yolk of egg and arrowroot biscuit ; and round the open water
vessel I had a growing crop of young grass and sprouting seeds. But
the birds seemed to be always hunting for tiny insects. In my small
garden I have a lot of the small black ants, and I think they ate these
and other small insects, caterpillars, and even quite big spiders.
On the advice of Dr. Hopkinson, in front of my small range of
aviaries I have a long, narrow corridor, with grass growing, and a
brick path. I got into the habit of opening the Fire-finches' aviary
every morning in the sunshine, they quickly hopped out, hunting all
the time in the 40 ft. run for insects, of which they seemed to find
plenty. They were never out together until the youngsters were several
days old, and the first time they were so I of course thought all was
lost, so again I put a finger into the nest and quickly removed it for
I felt something fluffy and warm. After that, as no harm came of it,
while the parents were out I peeped in nearly every day until one
day my finger was met with a howl of protest, or was it hunger ?
After that I had to be content with looking, and generally could just
see a little head, or the blue beads at the side of the beak, shining
like little lights.
These little Fire-finches are charming, the cock especially is
delightful, has a sweet little song, and mine would come and take
mealworms out of the pot with my hand still on it. He also always met
me at the corner of the aviary in the morning, ready for breakfast !
He was not so shy about feeding the youngsters as the hen, who seldom
went in if any one was looking, but protested loudly if she wished to
visit the nest ; but if one retired further away she at once went in.
Both birds were keen bathers. Needless to say, I became every day
more pleased, not to say elated, at my possible success in being the
first in England to breed this species, but it could not have come at
a more difficult time, as I was about to make a visit to Brazil and
had a very great deal to see about.
I should say on the eighteenth day, a Sunday, I had a party of
friends with children, to visit the Zoo, and whether or not their presence
in the garden had anything to do with it the three baby Fire-finches
left the nest while they were there--one was much bigger and stronger

than the others, the second much less advanced, and the third was
a very young bird though feathered. Then followed a difficult time ;
the wind was cold and next came a very wet day, and I had to be
always on the watch, putting the younger babes back in the nest for
warmth. The parents were wonderful in feeding, and up to the twenty-
second day, when I had to leave them, the whole family slept in the
nest, though not in the original one, because the cock had pretty w^ell
torn that to pieces. " Benjy " (as the tiny one was at once called !)
found just above their abode an old Buficauda nest, which, by the
way, is of rather a different type--the Fire-finch nest seemed to be
much deeper and was very cleverly arranged, so that they had a sort
of sloping path down. " Benjy " was really an expert at hiding, and
I have spent nearly an hour searching for him in the aviary, and had
to go away convinced that he had really vanished, only to find him
an hour or two later seated near to his nest mates.
The young are very like the adult hen in plumage, no spots on the
side, and the beak shows a good deal more white, and mine at twenty-
two days were smaller than the parents. They could fly well and could
find their way into the aviary from the long run, and back into the
adopted nest.

The Stitch-bird (Notiomystis cincta)
One of my chief reasons for visiting the Little Barrier Island was
to try to obtain a glimpse of one of the rarest of all existing birds,
namely the Stitch-bird, in the deep recesses of its forest home, the
last resort of this much-persecuted species.
One of New Zealand's endemic honey-eaters, it disappeared from
the mainland about the middle of the last century. At one time,
long before the coming of the white man, it must have been com-
paratively common in some portions of the North Island for its

beautiful golden feathers were used to manufacture the famous
Maori cloaks.
Soon after the coming of the white man to the shores of New
Zealand, this extraordinary bird practically ceased to exist. The
cause of its rapid disappearance will ever remain a mystery. The only
conjecture that appeals to reason is that the European birds, which
were liberated soon after the country was first settled, brought over
germs to which the Stitch-bird and many others were highly
susceptible, just as in the same way Europeans brought diseases to
the races of the South Sea Islands, against which they had no immunity,
so that in most of the islands there is but a mere remnant of their
former inhabitants.
As the bird became almost extinct, its skin became a desirable
addition to the cabinets of collectors and soon after its general
disappearance in most parts of the North Island collectors vied with
each other in their search for this illusive bird. About 1880 it became
known that the mountains of the Little Barrier Island were the last
refuge of the Stitch-bird and collectors journeyed over there in search
of it. In fact one Austrian skin collector named Keischek, who was
probably one of the worst bird butchers that New Zealand or any
other country has ever seen, sojourned over three months there with
the express purpose of killing every possible Stitch-bird. Ten birds
in all were secured, which shows how rare it must have been. And
so, apparently, the Stitch-bird made its exit from this plane, and the
various collectors were able to gloat over the skins as the very last
of the species. But, in spite of the endeavours of the collector to
exterminate this bird and fortunately for posterity, a few must have
been overlooked, finding refuge in some of the densely-forested and
almost inaccessible gullies between the mountains. About 1905 this
beautiful island was declared a bird sanctuary, and after that the
birds were again noticed in very small numbers.
What a thrill it was, the day after we landed on the island, when
working our way up a deep gully, which at certain seasons is the bed
of a rushing mountain stream, all overhung by giant tree ferns and
the beautiful Nikau palms, the great boulders over which we had to
climb covered with an immense variety of mosses and ferns, when

suddenly we heard the loud ringing calls of what we knew must be
the Stitch-bird. How our hearts beat as we watched a fully-plumaged
male come into view ; we watched him for a time as he searched for
his food amid the topmost branches of a forest tree, uttering all the
time his very loud ringing metallic notes. Later on we came across
a family party of five, these were in the undergrowth, and upon our
approach the female came out to investigate. Taking but little notice
of us she returned to her offspring who was busy searching the clumps
of leaves for tiny insects. We watched their activities for a considerable
time until they passed on to another part of the forest.
During our stay on the island when wandering in the deep gullies
-we often came across these birds and caught glimpses of the beautiful
fully-plumaged males, but usually the female is much more in evidence
than the males. They are by no means common though we sometimes
saw as many as seven in the course of a day, usually odd ones or pairs.
Unlike most of the other birds on the island the Stitch-bird is very
timid and no doubt it has good reason to be.
How much better to think of this bird safe for ever on its wonderful
island home than represented by a few perishable skins in museum
cabinets, for to the true naturalist there is no morbid joy in handling
a skin and thinking it the last of the race. Truly to own such a skin
\0x25A0should be a brand of shame to its owner.
It has been stated that the sole food of the Stitch-bird is nectar,
but whilst on the Barrier we found the bird feeding mainly on insects,
and we once saw a male feeding greedily on the berries of a tall forest
plant called Nothopanax arboreum.
The Stitch-bird is about the size of a lark, the head, neck, and
upper back deep black. From the ear-coverts spring two tufts of
pure white feathers, which can be erected like small horns on each
side of the head, though the bird usually keeps these concealed ; below
the black of the upper breast is a band of yellow feathers ; the shoulders,
lesser-wing-coverts, and under-wing-coverts are bright golden yellow,
though when seen in the forest these bright colours are hidden, the
upper parts are dark brownish olive, the feathers having darker
centres ; below is pale yellowish brown, the flank feathers being
mottled with dark brown. As mentioned before, little of the bright

colouring can be seen when the bird is in the forest ; it looks, except
for the black head and breast and the very conspicuous white wing-
coverts, a very dark olive. It is only when a skin is handled that the
brilliant yellow is apparent.
The Stitch-bird never leaves the confines of the deepest forest
groves ; it is also very local in its habitat, only being found in
certain gullies and seldom away from them.
In a letter from a young scientist who remained on the island
after we had gone, he says, " While having lunch on the way up out
of the Styx gorge a friendly Stitch-bird visited us and made a meal
off the heads of a Gahnia bush close by. Gahnia sp. is a tall # cutty-
grass ', a member of Cyperaccce, 3 ft. 6 in. high and bearing large
lax panicles of red brown seeds (nuts), there are five species on Little
Barrier, all similar."
Unlike many of the endemic birds of New Zealand there is no
record of this bird ever being kept in captivity and there is not the
slightest likelihood of it ever coming into the hands of any aviculturist,
for of all New Zealand's unique birds this is the most jealously guarded.
The North Island Robin (.Miro longipes)
Some time after the coming of the colonists to New Zealand, these
charming birds began to get rarer and rarer until it was thought that
they had become totally extinct. Buller says in the supplement to the
Birds of New Zealand (1905) : " I have the mournful satisfaction in
recording that the last heard-of pair of this expiring species was seen
just before I left the Colony in 1898 in the fringe of bush on the northern
side of the Papaitonga Lake . . . the birds were unmolested and
therefore had every chance ; but whether they have left any descendants
or not it is, of course, impossible to say. ... In the olden days it would
have been impossible to enter such a wood without hearing the strident
note of this Robin on all sides."
As in the case of the Stitch-bird no satisfactory explanation has
ever been given for the disappearance of this bird, except that the
introduced birds acting as the carriers of germs to which they them-
selves were immune passed the infection on to the indigenous birds, which
quickly succumbed. For the Robin was one of the very few birds which

were not persecuted in any way by the colonist. It certainly fell a prey
to the cats, rats, weasels, etc., and to the constant bush burnings,
but these facts cannot account for its disappearance from untouched
forested areas which were far from civilization and into which no
carnivorous mammals had yet penetrated.
Extremely confiding and familiar, it was known in the olden days
as " the Bushman's friend ", for this bright-eyed songster was always
the constant companion of the lonely bush pioneer. It would share
his meals, and his solitude, perching oft-times on his shoes when he
sat down. In fact, to him it seemed the reincarnation of the familiar
" Robin Redbreast " of the distant Homeland.
Fortunately this species has found sanctuary on the Little Barrier
Island and on Kapati, where it is comparatively numerous, though
it is still found in one or two localities on the mainland, in heavily-
forested areas, but there is very little likelihood that this species will
ever increase as the Bellbird has done, for no bird is more adversely
affected by civilization ; on the slightest sign of settlement even by
the cutting of tracks through the forest, the Robin disappears. It is
a bird exclusively of the deepest virgin forest.
Nearly all the birds on the Little Barrier Island are fearless, but
this one is especially so ; a few hundred yards into the forest and
one is sure to meet with it. Upon seeing a human being he will at
once come up to within a foot or two to investigate ; if one sits down
and keeps quiet, he Will come right up, cock his head on one side,
look up into one's face with his large, soft brown eyes as if to say,
" Hello, fancy you coming here ! " In a very short time he will make
himself at home, turning up the dead leaves in search of insects or
looking for material for his nest ; he will remain so close that one
can touch him.
I know of no more endearing creature than this dusky denizen of
the dense forests of the Barrier ; it is a thousand pities that it has
practically vanished from the mainland.
On the first day in the forests of Little Barrier we counted six of
these birds, several of them coming up to investigate the bright orange
rubber shoes which I wore as a protection to my feet when walking
up the beds of the mountain streams.

Sydney Porter--Notes on New Zealand Birds
If it were only for my experiences with the Robins I should always
feel that my visit to the island had been worth while. Whenever we
went into the forest we invariably had a delightful encounter with
these birds, sometimes they would alight on the sticks we were carrying
and on several occasions we could have picked them up. The demeanour
of the Robin is that of welcoming the stranger into his forest domain.
He introduces himself and often his family, shows one how to make
oneself at home and after his mission has been accomplished he departs.
His affection is not cupboard love, for as far as we have been concerned
he has never taken the crumbs we have offered to him ; had we have
had any mealworms it would have been a different matter.
On Kapiti Island it was a great joy to see these delightfully
confiding birds more or less out in the open, where they can be seen
much more to advantage than in the sombre gloom of the forests.
The great attraction to the birds was a tennis court which was in the
making. It was situated on a steep hillside and necessitated a great
deal of earth being carted from one side to the other to level it up.
This was the Robin's El Dorado, and all day long they grubbed about
in the newly turned-up earth for worms, grubs, and small insects.
The birds were absolutely fearless, and Mr. Wilkinson's son told me
that he often had difficulty in avoiding injuring the birds when working,
they got so much in the way. Here in the brilliant sunlight they
appeared much brighter in colour than in the forest. In colour the
Robin is vastly different from the ordinary Englishman's conception
of what a Robin should look like. The male is a very dark, mottled
leaden, greyish black, the centre of the abdomen ivory white. The hen
is very much duller in colour. A very conspicuous feature of the male
is a patch of snow-white feathers just above the beak, only exposed
when the bird is excited. During the time I watched the birds on
Kapiti this spot was exposed owing to the presence of a Weka, which
was also searching for worms in the loose earth. Another striking
feature is the beautiful lustrous black eye. It is a large bird almost
equalling in bulk the European Thrush, though not so long in body
measurement.
Unfortunately the Robin has many enemies. The caretaker on
Kapiti told me that he once opened a cat which he shot on the island

and found the stomach full of robin feathers. Owing to its confiding
nature it had fallen a prey to all the introduced carnivorous mammals
and it is little to be wondered at that it has almost vanished except
from the two islands where it now finds sanctuary. Let us hope that
its numbers will increase for to my mind there is no more endearing
feathered creature in the world than the North Island Robin of New
Zealand.
I was told that the birds on Kapiti recognize territorial rights,
each pair having dominion over an area of about ten acres. Any bird
of their own species which invades this area is soon put to flight.

(Concluded from page 423)
Although I had five of my little flock of White-crested Penelopes
for three years they never showed any inclination to breed. True,
I made no provision for it, but the virgin forest was close at hand
and most days they paid a visit there, always remaining on the fringe
from whence they had an uninterrupted view of the house, and as I have
said, if I whistled they flew to me immediately. Several times they
were joined there by wild birds of the same species, but were never
induced to leave their home quarters for a purely wild life.
My house had a verandah 10 feet wide along the three bedrooms
on one side, and the tiled roof was supported by beams, and on these
they roosted and spent most of the day. They were very affectionate,
and whenever I had time to spare to rest out there, they kept as near
to me as they could. The verandah was a sanctuary for pets, as it
was unapproachable except through my bedroom and one other, and
no natives were ever allowed there. I had built the house myself and
designed it with that idea. Although I had twenty or more dogs,
great hunters, and all very savage with strangers, not one ever molested
my birds, which had all been hand-reared, except the two Yellow-
collared Macaws, and the birds of various species showed no fear of
the dogs.

Curassows ( Cracidce) were scarce with us at all seasons, and I never
saw but one species, one of the Curly-crested ones, and although
I offered a good reward, I only succeeded in getting one so very young
I doubted if I could possibly rear it. However, I did, and it became as
tame as the Penelopes. For a long time it kept with them, and perhaps
they taught it to fly over to the forest. Later it seemed to prefer the
company of the poultry, and spent part of the hot hours of the day
in the fowlhouse, a large building heavily thatched and with split
bamboo walls. When it was about two years old the men began to
report having seen it in the forest with a male, and one evening when
out with the dogs I came across them myself in a very high tree.
I whistled and my bird came lower down while the male flew off,
but the female was back at the house before me. In the end she stayed
away for longer periods and some nights was not in her usual sleeping
place under the verandah. Then came a time when she paid very
occasional and hurried visits, until one day she brought a nearly full-
grown young one with her, which only alighted on the roof and did
not stay. After this she made her home with me again and did not
wander for several months, in fact she resumed quite her old life among
the poultry. When I left the country she had not been seen for more
than a month. If she turned up again I never heard.
Nearer the Amazon, Curassows are popular birds with the Indians ;
in almost every village it is the usual bird one expects to find walking
about with full wings. There was always a mild excitement on arriving
at a village to see what livestock they might have, for sometimes one
found the most unexpected things, perhaps tied to the rafters in the
houses, or better still, to wait until the evening when semi-tame birds
came home to roost. I was once in a Napo village for a month, and
even at the end of that time something fresh still came in. Occasionally
an Indian shows affection for some pet animal or bird, but it is more
often the children who keep them, and the more uncivilized tribes
who are kindest to them. While I was in Bolivia I heard of a raid
on a village of remote forest Indians, and an American who had " gone
native " was among the party in the disgraceful affair. He told me
himself that he saw one woman running off before the rifles of the
raiders, with a monkey in her arms, and another snatch up a pet

Parrot. I have heard that the Jivaros Indians on the Curarai Upper
Amazon keep large numbers of animals and birds in a building con-
structed for that purpose in the centre of their villages, and looked
after by the community. I heard this from several sources along the
Napo, so possibly it is true. I have often thought how I would like
to visit them, as no doubt good things might be picked up.
Hoatzins were numerous along the banks of rivers in the forests
of Esperanza. Twice I had an odd one brought in ; one I had to kill
as it had a damaged wing, and the other I let go. In both cases
I noticed how helpless they were when set on the floor. They ran
in a drunken-like manner, with claws doubled up, until they came to
the wall, and then dropped down. They seemed to have no sense of
direction, neither did they use their feet in the ordinary way. When
crossing a river they just drop down anyhow on the bushes, trusting
to their powerful claws to get a foothold. I never saw their nests,
although I was told they bred in our neighbourhood. I am afraid
these birds have no attraction for me, as long ago I saw how hopeless
they would be as inmates of an aviary, especially so as leaves form
their sole diet. When freshly caught they have a very disagreeable
odour, at least the two brought to me had. Hoatzins are a common
sight along the banks of all the rivers leading to the Amazon, some-
times in great numbers, and often about after dark. The Indians do
not eat the flesh.
Ever since early boyhood I have been fond of hand-rearing young
birds, and I am still. The people employed at Esperanza had no idea
whatever how to catch any kind of bird, so it was only nestlings they
brought in. The most important, from its position in the household,
was a Blue-and-yellow Macaw which I got very shortly after my
arrival. It was one of two in a nest in a great royal palm, the other
was allowed to remain there. I was two days' ride from home and
I remember still what a helpless ungainly creature it was, still in the
down, and seemingly all head and beak. I carried it in a towel on
the front of the saddle and had only boiled sweet potatoes to give
it. " Lora," it was eventually called, developed into quite a personality.
At first it lived on the seat of a chair on the verandah, and after it
could climb, on the back. It seemed quite content to stay there even

when fully feathered, and for weeks never left the chair except when
I took it off. It grew apace and vigorously exercised its wings until
one Sunday it was missing. I was very busy at the time, but sent
people out in all directions, and as soon as I was free I spent the rest

of the day wandering around the clearing examining all trees through
the glasses, with no result. That night we had a particularly violent
thunderstorm, and I wondered many times if it had lived through it.
Days went by without any news, and then, on the following Sunday
morning, exactly eight days later, I heard a noise from the fowls such
as they make when a hawk is about, and there on the ground just
in front of the verandah was poor " Lora " feebly trying to crawl
home, with face all scratched, and frightfully thin and weak. No
wanderer was ever more thankfully welcomed. After all, I doubt if
she had gone far, perhaps not even out of the clearing, and certainly
could not have found any food. It seemed as if she had been trying
to eat grass, as some was still in her beak. As she had never been
outside the verandah she would not know what the place looked like
from the outside, and probably had only been attracted back by
familiar sounds. I did not cut her wing, as I felt sure she would not
stray again, and she never did without returning. Later, she used
her wings to full advantage and often circled high up over the house.
Every day several hocks of the same species flew over the clearing
continually uttering their harsh screams, to which " Lora " replied,
and although they often turned back and came lower down she was
never tempted to join them. If I left home for a few days or even
hours she always had to be shut up until I had got well away in the
forest, or she flew off at once to find me, wheeling high in sky. To
watch for my return she took up her station in a tall tree by the house,
and on sighting me at once flew to my shoulder, overwhelming me
with affection. As Spanish was the language of the household she
learned much of it, but I had an Indian houseboy from whom she
learned many Chiquitana expressions. For instance, when she wanted
water, she always asked for pututu, and she still continued this over
here up to the day she died. The first year I had her I took her with
me on my annual visit to Concepcion, a boy carrying her in a box
on his back. Each day when I stopped for lunch and swung my

hammock in the forest, " Lora " was let out. One day when I wanted
to put her back I found she had climbed to the top of the tree, and
as she was not to be enticed down I pretended to leave her and started
to ride off. She gave a scream and very quickly came down. It was
amusing sometimes to see her sitting in the big tree frequented by
the Black Turkey Vultures, such very ill assorted companions. She
commenced by sleeping on a bracket specially made for her in my
room, to which she retired of her own accord at sundown, but after a
time it worried me to hear her constantly stamping and fluttering her
wings to keep off the mosquitos, so one night I brought her under
my net where she slept comfortably on my shoulder. From that night
she would never stop on her bracket after I came to bed, and got so
used to my movements in the night that, as I turned, she automatically
climbed to the other shoulder ; and here her delicate instincts showed
up, for she never once soiled the bed. The first night she came in she
woke me up by saying " Lora, Lora," in my ear, so I just stroked
her, but still there was something else she wanted, and finally walked
down my arm and pulled my fingers. At last it dawned on me, so
I lifted the net and held her outside, when, after relieving herself, she
quickly ran back up my arm. After that a paper was laid on the floor,
and, once every night I either had my fingers pulled, or heard " Lora "
whisper in my ear. Surely Macaws are the most intelligent of all
Parrots, and I think mine the most intelligent of them all, so
much so that over here people used to think her almost uncanny
at times.
As I have said before, I had a long and arduous journey out of
the country and how I got her home I hardly know, as I was very
ill for a great part of the time and very short of food, so I was often
at my wits' end to know what to give her. Moreover, we had to find
a way down endless rivers, cross swamps, and endure untold hardships
before we finally reached the Mamore on the western frontier of Brazil,
where our troubles ended. For two consecutive nights on one river
we were attacked by Indians. When we reached Liverpool we had
to part as I sent " Lora " straight on to Hoddam Castle until I decided
upon her future, and when two weeks later I went there myself I was
surprised when Mr. Brook said "We give 4 Lora ' jpututu whenever

she asks for it." They had found out what she meant, and her name
as well as other things. She lived over here twelve years and only
came to an untimely end last year greatly missed by those who loved
her. She picked up a lot of English and other accomplishments, but
used her Spanish less and less retaining only a few sentences.
It seems that the Bolivian Blue-and-yellow Macaws are larger
and more brilliantly coloured than those from other parts, for I have
never seen one over here anything like mine. Except for the same
arrangement of colours all those at the Zoo might have belonged to
another species altogether. I often wished I could have brought mine
up from the country just to show them what a Blue-and-yellow Macaw
could look like. I think " Lora " was a female, and no doubt would
have nested if she had had a mate. Some seasons, about August, she
came into condition and was very noisy and unsettled, keeping mostly
to the bottom of her cage. At these times her nostrils became very
swollen and red. I have not noticed this with a Macaw before. I wonder
if anyone else has. I was her favourite up to the end, for although
I only saw her at intervals she always knew me instantly, even once
after two years' absence, and as long as I was there she had no use for
anyone else, but tolerated just two others when I was away. After
I had this bird I could never shoot another Macaw, and never will
again, in fact, I am now averse to killing anything, especially birds.
Like many other birds Macaws like to rest during the midday
hours, but instead of choosing a shady tree they seem to prefer a high
one standing well above the others with wide spreading branches and
little leaf. One might be close under them without knowing there
was a bird about, for they keep perfectly quiet as long as they see
they have not been observed, but give one look up and the place is
a Babel. A flock of Macaws makes a lovely picture against the intensely
blue sky and vivid sunlight of the dry season, and if they are not
absolutely at rest they have a regular game among themselves.
A boy one evening brought me five very young birds with eyes
scarcely open, and I was not quite sure what they were until the next
morning when I saw they must be Swallows. Of course these were
useless to me, but I thought I would give the poor little beggars a
chance. Fortunately I was always able to get an almost unlimited

supply of wasp grubs, so there was no difficulty in rearing them.
These also lived on the verandah in a small open box, and it was not
long before they used their wings, for they grew quickly. At first they
remained on the beams and flew down to me when they wanted food.
One after the other they began to take flights outside, returning to
the verandah to sleep, but grew to want less and less of my food,
until two cleared right off. Three still returned in the evenings for
quite another month, and then only one remained and that not for long.
The following year a pair of Swallows came back to roost and would
have built a nest, but were interfered with by my other birds. I could
not help thinking that one or both of these must have been those
of the previous year, as I never had a Swallow come there before
or after.
At another time I had two of the weirdest youngsters I have ever
seen, and it was quite a time before I knew exactly what they were,
although I surmised they were some sort of Cuckoo. They proved to
be one of the long-tailed ones (Piaya cay ana). At first they were covered
with spiky-looking grey quills quite two inches long, surmounted
with tufts of grey down. It was really quite difficult to handle them,
for they looked like little Porcupines and quite formidable. As the
feathers in the quills developed, more than half the upper portion
shrivelled up and dropped away. I fed them on the usual wasp grubs,
cockroaches, and hard-boiled egg, for I had no biscuits, bread, or
cake to make an insectile mixture. Flour was unobtainable, so the
only form of bread I had for four years was made of maize meal which
we grew ourselves. They turned out to be delightful birds and lived
to reach England just as tame as ever. I gave them to Mr. Brook
together with several other unusual birds. This Cuckoo is common
over a large part of tropical South America in several subspecies.
In Ecuador they were called Lengua de vaca (" Cow's Tongues "), why,
I have no idea. They go in flocks, keeping to the low bushes in the
more open parts. The tail is very long and bright chestnut on
the upper side ; it is graduated with deep black and white tips to the
outer feathers, which looks very fine spread out in flight, or floating
better expresses it, as they seem to float from bush to bush. Roughly,
the colours are fawn and pale grey with darker chestnut wings. The

bill is greenish yellow, and a bare patch around the eyes much the
same shade, although in some districts this is red. The inside of
the mouth is intense black.
I had many young Trogons brought in both red and yellow breasted.
These I found quite easy to rear on the same food as the Cuckoos.
I must have had quite a dozen at one time. I found them all a bit
stupid about learning to pick food up for themselves, and, strange to
say, it was not insects they essayed on, but yolk of egg in nearly every
case. Later, they ate a certain amount of fruit. I was disappointed
that I had none of them to bring home with me, but two months
before I left I was delayed by illness in the town, and when I returned
to Esperanza they were all dead, together with several other rare birds.
Two Nun or Puff Birds (Monasa nigrifrons) were still alive. I do
not think any of this genus have yet been over here. They are about
the size of a Starling but with a longer tail and very short wings. The
plumage is very thick and fluffy, usually leaden grey or black with
a coral red bill, although one species has a whitish bill. They are not
very interesting but uncommon. My pair died on the way down to the
Amazon. They are purely insectivorous, and strange as it may seem
in a land like that, it was extremely difficult on a canoe journey to
procure enough insects for them. I was compelled to stop on sandbanks
and scoop up a net full of butterflies as they were partial to them,
but I must have got some noxious kind among them as they both died
suddenly after a meal.
Another pair of hand-reared birds I landed was Molina's Conure
(Pyrrhura molince). This is an altogether delightful species. As a
rule I am not very partial to the Conures, but these I did like.
Of all the birds that visited us in the breeding season the one I most
wanted was the famous Umbrella Bird (Cephalopterus ornatus). It
arrived in September and was far from rare. I have seen them along
the edge of the forest, and on one occasion right out in the clearing.
During my last season there I sent a letter out to all overseers
throughout the forest asking them to locate nests, for which I offered
a good reward. According to reports, I began to think I should have
a surfeit of Umbrella Birds to rear, as some reported two or even three
nests being built. In the end only one materialized and that so young

it was useless even to attempt to rear it, and I asked the man who
brought it to take it back to the nest. I never heard anything more
about it. It could only have been hatched that morning, and was
covered in long silky down, bright gold in colour and like floss silk.
A year earlier when calling at a shack, I found a brown bird there
undoubtedly belonging to this species, which they said had been hand-
reared. I never knew before that the nest plumage was brown. They
gave me this bird, but as I was not returning home for a week, I asked
that it should be sent to me later. It turned up dead, but still warm.
It had probably had nothing to eat or drink during its two days'
journey. My disappointment may be imagined. The only other I saw
was one on a farm I stopped at on the pampa near Concepcion.
Sitting on the frame of a chair was a fully adult male with a broken
wing, so although it was offered to me as a present, I did not accept
it. I was told it was feeding on cockroaches. All our people were
very proud to adorn their hats with the crests. I have seen a man
with as many as nine or ten on his. They called the bird Pajaro vaca
(" Cow-bird "), but in Ecuador and Colombia, Pajaro toro (" Bull-bird ").
The West Ecuadorian species (C. penduliger) is much the finer bird
of the two. A Colorado Indian at Santo Domingo once brought me
an adult male uninjured, and although I tried it on all kinds of fruits
and insects, even a palm fruit I had seen them eating, it refused all
food and died. This palm fruit is the size and shape of a large green
date and is, of course, swallowed whole. Like some other birds, it is
impossible to cram them as they promptly regurgitate all food so
administered. I believe the Umbrella Bird has not yet been imported
alive, although before the War there was a notice in the Avicultural
Magazine that somebody had one. I heard later that this was
incorrect, and if I remember rightly the bird turned out to be a large
Bice Grackle (Cassidix orgzivora).
Occasionally I saw Purple-throated Cotingas (Cotinga cayana ) at
Esperanza, always in the tops of the highest trees. Also Magpie
Tanagers, which seemed to belong to the larger species (Cissopsis
major), although I never shot one to make sure. If so, this is another
bird not imported.
Three times I came across a flock of that truly wonderful bird,

the Naked-necked Fruit Crow (Gymnoderus fcetidus). It is rather
larger than a Jay, and in a dry skin may be black or greyish, but
in life it is covered with a fine powder which gives the
plumage a bloom like that on pothouse grapes. The wings
are lavender, but it is the head and neck which gives it
such a remarkable appearance. The crown is feathered and
velvety, dark Indian red, and at the base of this is a row of thick
nodules from which hang fleshy folds of skin to the shoulders, draped
in a wonderful manner, and shaded from white to bright cobalt blue.
I collected one skin of this bird years before on the Upper Amazon,
and a water-colour drawing was made of the head and neck while
still fresh. This was reproduced in The Ibis , and it is well worth
looking up. Of course, later all this bare skin fades and shrivels up,
so no conception can be formed as to what the bird looks like in life.
What a wonderful sight it would be in an aviary.
Swallow-billed Tanagers or Fruit Eaters (Procnias coerulea ) also
arrived about September, but unlike my experience with another
closely allied species (P. tersa), which frequents low bushes, this one
I saw always in high trees. I wanted some badly, but as I said about
the people in another part of South America, I could get no one here
to climb trees. These birds adapt themselves readily to cage life, and
are easy to keep. I had previously brought home P. tersa occidentalism
and never found it would even look at an insect, but readily eat any
kind of cut-up fruit. It has a very wide gape like a Swallow's, but
larger in proportion. So it can take surprisingly large fruits. The male
is uniform cerulean blue, and has a black mask, the lower breast
white, and finely barred on the flanks with black. In some lights the
bird looks greenish-blue, and in others the richest cerulean imaginable.
The females are green with no mask, and yellow instead of white on
the breast.
Tinamous of various species were exceedingly numerous in the
forest, and it was impossible to go any distance without flushing some,
but it was only possible to get a very momentary glimpse of them
as their noisy flight was so sudden and unexpected. I had many young
ones brought in each year, and some lived for a long time but usually
escaped in the end as the enclosure I made for them always seemed to

be getting defective. I identified three of those I had, namely Northo-
procta ornata, Northocercus garleppi and Rhynchotus maculicollis. With
them I had a single Marbled Partridge (Odontophorus marmorata), the
sole survivor of three. This I brought home and sent up to Hoddam.
I think these Partridges were fairly plentiful, but as they never rise
it was difficult to get even a glimpse of them. I only definitely saw
some on one occasion in four years.
Once a pair of King Vultures lived on the edge of the clearing for
several months. I was hoping they would nest there, but if they did
we never found it, which would be rather unlikely with such large
birds. Several times I shot Peccaries to entice them to remain, and
gave strict orders they were not to be interfered with. This is one
of the birds for which I have a great admiration, and it has always
been my ambition to possess a tame one, for apart from their beauty
they make delightful pets.
A bird I was disappointed not to find, at Esperanza, was the
Trumpeter (Psophia). I believe they do not come farther south than the
Marmore. On my exit I saw them at every village along that river,
but not one before there. It is quite one thing to keep them in an
aviary and another to have them at liberty, even if only in a small
garden. In the forests it is impossible to form any idea as to what
they are really like, and their ways. All Indians seem very fond of
them, and you find them in almost every village, but they are jealous
birds according to how much they are petted, and it is some-
times difficult to keep two together. I have noticed in villages
each one usually keeps to a restricted area, unless they are a
pair, and even then they do not always agree. I once kept a pair
together in England amicably. In South America they often have
them to look after poultry, as they are quick to give warning
when hawks are about. It is amusing at such times to see them
hurrying all the young chickens off to a place of shelter. They are
fond of a family to look after, and soon gather all chickens around
them in the daytime, but Trumpeters like to roost high. So until
the chicks get their flight feathers the Trumpeter calls in vain from
some high branch, but I have seen them roosting with many on each
side. Those who have not yet owned one have a treat in store. Several

species are now imported, but at one time not so long ago, they were
rare over here. Some years back I told a lady member of the Society
about their charms, and later when she was able to get one, she wrote
me " they are all you said they were, and much more From a beauty
point of view I am not sure which is my favourite ; perhaps the White -
backed kind (P. leucoptera), although the Napo or Golden-backed (P.
napersis) is a lovely bird when in good, full plumage. This was the first
species I ever had, and does not seem to be imported. During a long
canoe journey on my way down to the Amazon I never hesitated to
give them their liberty every evening when we camped. They retired
to roost in the nearest tree, if there was one. It is not generally realized
that these birds are quite at home in water, and can swim perfectly.
Over here they require a warm or sheltered place to sleep in during
the winter, or their feet suffer. This seems to be their weak point
and the chief cause of death, but can easily be avoided ; and they
should not be allowed to walk too much in the winter time. They
follow like a dog. One of my Golden-backs often went out with me
shooting, keeping close at heel along the Indian tracks. I should like
to see a pair of these given their liberty on the Fellows' Tea Lawn
at the Zoo, during the summer time. What an attraction they would
be, for few birds become so attached to man as these. It would
be easy to shut them up in the Eastern aviaries at night, but I fancy
there is a tree on the lawn they would prefer. All species on the Upper
Amazon are called Yacami, and on the Lower, Trompeteros.
I left Bolivia without a regret, and I cannot say that of any other
country I have been to, even including sinister New Guinea with its
poisonous climate to which I have returned again and again. Usually
unpleasant things are forgotten, and only the pleasant ones remem-
bered, and in nearly all other countries certain exceptionally pleasant
camps stand out, and I long to revisit them again. Some I have, but
not so in Bolivia.
Usually Amazonian forests are very silent, and one may wonder
where are all the animals and birds one has read so much about. It
has to be remembered how vast is their feeding ground, and all game
moves about with the fruiting season. Find some such district and
the number of birds, monkeys, and other animals there will astonish

you. Indian tribes too follow the game, moving from one locality
to another. Some have several villages, perhaps a week's journey or
more apart, to which they change over.
The main Amazon is undoubtedly not interesting with its
monotonous and uniform level, and so wide as to suggest the sea.
The only pretty part is at the narrows above Para, where the ship
passes through a succession of narrow channels between some islands.
To see the real life of Amazonas one must go far from the main river
to its narrower affluents where the banks are nearer, or up creeks,
where the branches may even meet overhead, to see some of its animal
Hfe.
We have all heard from childhood that saying about " Birds without
song, flowers without scent, etc. " as applied to the tropics, but was
anything more inaccurate ever written ? I have heard more song
in the early morning in a jungle than I have ever heard in Europe.
For one thing both numbers and species are far more numerous there
than they are with us. Some say " Yes, but what about the Blackbirds
and Thrushes ? " Well, there are members of this family to be found
nearly all over the world, some of them no mean songsters either.
I often think of those daybreak hours in the far interior of Borneo
for one place, and I think how I used to enjoy the volume of song
and all the various musical calls of birds known and unknown to me
by their voices, as I lay in bed for that all too short time between
dawn and sunrise. I can well imagine, say a Dyak, taken away to
some other land, how homesick he would be for all this. Even I myself
on my way back there on subsequent visits have been looking forward
to hearing it all again ; and the pleasure certain songs and calls I had
forgotten gave me when I remembered them again. I often shut my
eyes and thought " Have I ever been away from this Australia,
although not all in the tropics, has enough brilliantly-coloured birds
in all conscience, and yet some whose song can equal our best.
I grant the raucous notes of many of the inmates of the Bird House
at the Zoo sound a bit distracting there, but the same in their native
jungle are quite in keeping, and many toned down by distance perhaps
sound even agreeable. It always gives me the greatest pleasure to
hear the ringing notes of some of the Paradise Birds. It takes me

back to some New Guinea camp, or river journey, and I see it all over
again, the throbbing of the native drums down in the villages, the
stamp of the feet in the dance, and even the finish of some of their
songs, with sounds palpably suggested by the call of the Paradise
Birds. What would New Guinea be like without this call echoing from
valley to valley.
That ear-splitting note of the Bell Bird can sound almost beautiful
in a Brazilian forest, but I have listened to it from far and near, trying
my best to believe it sounded like a bell when heard under these con-
ditions, but I never could. I think its Brazilian name of Anvil Bird
fits it much better. So, when some exotic call sounds distracting to
us over here, try to think of it in its own surroundings, when it would
convey quite a different impression, even pleasant or beautiful.
After my return from Bolivia I spent two or three months at home
trying to readjust myself to civilization and then accepted a post
offered to me to look after some diamond mines in the far interior
of Brazil, where I stayed for three years. After that, I took up collecting
once more. Birds on the mines were hardly worth writing about,
although I did keep a few. It was a far better place for snakes than
birds, and I kept quite a number, and let me whisper it here, I believe
I am quite as fond of them as I am of birds, which is saying a lot.

I fear that Mr. Porter's article on New Zealand Birds (September, 1933)
will have been somewhat misleading to those of your readers who have never
visited this country.
Some of his remarks dealing with the subject of our native forests are,
quite candidly, nonsense. He writes of these forests : ". . . but little is
now left ... a few acres which someone has forgotten to burn. 5 " Would it
surprise him to learn that one company alone, of which the writer knows,
has recently purchased over seven thousand acres covered with heavy forest--
this hardly sounds as if the bush remained only in tiny patches, does it ?
Has Mr. Porter ever halted upon the top of Mount Messenger and looked
about him ? To north, south, east, and west one sees nothing but range
upon range all clothed with native forest. Has he ever stood upon the top
of the Akataweras where the same sight meets the eyes ? The writer could
mention twenty such places where one can see - literally tens of thousands
of acres of heavy forest.

Mr. Porter would have your readers believe that our farmers bum off the
bush and then tolerate the thistle, ragwort, and gorse because they remind
them of home. If only he knew of the number of struggling farmers who
have been driven off their land by these cursed pests ! Does he really imagine
that farmers spend large sums of money in bringing bush land to a state of
productivity and then welcome the thistle and gorse ?
After all, one's first business is to live, and our farmers are merely
endeavouring to carry out this duty by bringing land into productivity which
previously yielded nothing.
Once they were called " pioneers ", now they call them " vandals ". But
were it not for them many of us would go hungry to bed !
No, Sir, the average New Zealand farmer is not quite such a blackguard
as Mr. Porter would have your readers believe. Would it surprise you to
learn that many of them even take an interest and a pride in our native flora
and that they fence and protect (and even re-plant) such patches as remain,
upon their properties ?
One appreciates and makes allowances for the fact that Mr. Porter is a
very keen admirer of our native birds--some of us actually love them too !
Mr. Porter should endeavour to recover his sense of proportion.

CONDOR BREEDING IN CAPTIVITY IN GERMANY

A breeding record which I cannot find among those given so far by
Dr. Hopkinson is that of the Condor ( Sarcorhamphu-s gryphus). This big
Vulture has nested with full success here in the Zoological Garden six years
ago, and the chick which has been reared is alive to-day. Also in 1928 the
pair nested but the chicks did not live. The birds live all the year round
in a big aviary and stand our very severe winters (we had 28* Reaumur
below zero last year) perfectly.
I have further found that the Roulroul (Rollulus roulroul ) has been bred
by a Mr. August Wiener in London as long ago as 1878. Bruno Duerigen
states in his book on poultry-keeping that two chicks were hatched in the
aviaries of Mr. Wiener, but whether they lived to maturity is not mentioned.
