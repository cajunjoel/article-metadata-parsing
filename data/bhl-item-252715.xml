The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species .
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.

This lovely little bird, which, in its wild state, has a wide range
throughout Northern Australia, has always been a great favourite
of mine, for when once acclimatized it is a good liver and its beauty is
equalled by few. When first imported it certainly needs considerable
care as do all the Ornamental Finches of Australia and elsewhere. It is
not often imported, and I imagine that although so widely distributed,
it is nowhere found in nearly such abundance as, for instance, the
Gouldian Finch, and apparently when first captured it is a more
difficult bird to acclimatize than some of the others. There is no doubt
that it is to a large extent insectivorous and probably suffers if fed on
nothing but dry seed when first caught. At times it is apt to be
decidedly quarrelsome. Many years ago I possessed a pair of these
birds, which gave no trouble, but immense pleasure. They were kept in
a large aviary, the outer part of which was planted with shrubs and grass
and the inner part warmed during winter. Their companions were
many and varied, but although they would occasionally appear
somewhat aggressive, they never actually did any harm that I could
detect. They made several nests, generally in round basket receptacles,
and actually hatched their eggs on one or two occasions but did not
succeed in rearing their young. Later, at the Zoological Gardens, we
were more successful and a pair actually reared a brood of three in 1912.
But this pair proved rather more quarrelsome than my original pair,
and rendered the lives of a pair of Peale's Parrot Finches unbearable,
so we had to move them to a compartment containing larger birds.

D. Seth-Smith--The Crimson Finch
This was in the " Summer " aviary, a large open aviary thickly planted
with shrubs and grass which was allowed to grow to its full perfection
and to flower and form seed, and no doubt there was ample insect life
amongst the vegetation. The " Summer " aviary has, alas! disappeared,
and there is no aviary now at the Zoo where success in breeding these
birds could be expected. My idea of a suitable aviary for these and many
other species of birds consists of a good-sized covered portion, well
lighted and heated in winter, communicating with a comparatively
small, open, wired enclosure which, in its turn, communicates with a
much larger wired enclosure which can be well planted and laid down
with grass. I suggested this type to our President when he was about
to build his aviary and he adopted niv plan, and most of us know how
successful the Foxwarren aviaries have been.
The old Summer " aviary was excellent in its way, and we bred
many birds in it, but it was only suitable for summer use and there was
always a risk when birds were first put out, whereas if such an enclosure
communicates with a smaller enclosure and then a warm house, the
birds .can always return to warmer conditions should the weather
become cold in spring and early summer.
But to return to the Crimson Finch, which, by the way, is some-
times known by the less attractive, though equally descriptive, name
of " Blood Finch while in Australia it is sometimes given the name
of " Pheasant Finch " on account of its possession of a comparatively
long pointed tail. The nest is the usual domed structure common
to most of the Grass Finch tribe, built of hay, leaves, and so forth, and
lined with feathers and vegetable down. It may be built in a low
bush, or in a covered box or basket, and providing the weather is
favourable and plenty of insect food is available there should be no
great difficulty in rearing the young in an outdoor aviary. This is one
of the gems of the so-called Ornamental Finches, always keeping in
tight " plumage and always active and engaging, and is well worth
securing when obtainable, but at the same time the fact that it can be
quarrelsome and even dangerous towards the more feeble folk must not
be lost sight of.

By Captain H. S. Stokes
Five or six years of unsuccessful effort to breed these lovely birds
had made me despair of ever achieving any success, and I ceased to
be at all excited as clutch after clutch of eggs was laid, only to be
eaten or to prove unfertile. Once, in September, 1926, the pair of
birds I still have hatched a young one and brooded it for a month,
only to leave it to die in the nest one cold night. This was really&apos; my
own fault, because I went into the aviary at dusk after three weeks'
absence abroad to greet the parents, both of whom have always been
very tame. This excited and upset them, and the British Museum
of Natural History got more satisfaction out of the poor little&apos;one's
corpse than I did. In subsequent years the eggs always proved clear
or were eaten by the parents.
This year, having parted with a great many of my soft-billed birds,
I was able to give the Touracos a large aviary to themselves, with
branches spaced well apart, where they had to fly or jump a good distance
and so got plenty of exercise. This seemed to improve the health and
vitality of the cock, who suffers sometimes from rheumatism in his foot.
Nesting baskets used for Pigeons were put up on the wall both
indoors and outside. The first clutch of eggs laid indoors came to
nothing as usual. The next clutch (only one egg) was laid outdoors,
and in the middle of July my servant Albert, who was then looking
after the birds, reported a young Touraco hatched three days previously.
I was furious ! " Why hadn't I been told before ? Weren't they my
birds ? I must go and look at once." But no, I was firmly excluded
from that aviary, and had to be content with quizzing and squinting
and craning my neck, hoping for the best while imagining the worst.
The parents brooded the young very closely, the cock by day,
the hen by night, as with Pigeons. It was never left for a moment,
and the change over in the evening always took place at six o'clock.
Touracos are expensive birds to feed, being mainly frugivorous. Others
have told me they may be fed on potatoes and rice, but mine scorn
such coarse fare and demand bananas, soaked currants and chopped

apples and grapes. They also condescend to eat a well-made rice
pudding, which usually and surreptitiously finds its way to them from
the luncheon table when I am at home. At this time we also gave
them a little diluted Nestle's milk with sponge cake soaked in it. The
increasingly rapid disappearance of this and the bananas were a
pretty good guide to the progress of the young one. Both parents
fed the young by regurgitation, and after a fortnight of suspense and
excitement I was finally allowed into the aviary to watch this
performance through a crack in the bottom of the basket.
The young bird left the nest when twenty-eight days old, a little,
fluffy, black nigger. That day he climbed about among some low
branches and we shut the family indoors for the night and watched
till we were satisfied he was being properly brooded.
When five weeks old we saw him helping himself to food on the
table. He was still in black down with a good deal of white on the
wings. This white remained until he was nearly full-grown, when the
wing feathers gradually changed to the lovely carmine colours peculiar
to Touracos. Only at this stage did I dare mention his existence to
anyone, for fear he should die to spite me. But he continued to thrive,
and after I had been away for ten days I returned to find him three-
quarters grown, with crest well developed, his breast and tail already
purple, his wings still white.
This species has been bred in France by M. Delacour, but the
breeding pair were unfortunately destroyed during the German advance ;
in 1918. It has not been bred in England before, and as far as I know
is only the second species with which success has been attained in
this country.
As no coloured plate accompanies these notes a detailed description
of the bird may be useful. The Senegal Touraco is a lovely creature,
about 15 inches long ; head, neck and breast all bright grass green. ;
Back, wings, and tail glossy violet; quills, with the exception of the j
outer ones, bright crimson, with the edges and shafts black. It has i

The sexes are alike and very difficult to distinguish, though perhaps
the white patch in'front of the eye is bigger in the male than in the ;

female. The British Museum catalogue gives the size of the female
as 2 inches longer than the male, but I have always considered my
male to be the longer and slimmer of the pair, the hen being shorter
and more thick-set.
It inhabits west Africa, where it ranges from Senegambia to the
Congo. It is a forest bird and largely frugivorous, though it also eats
leaves. Its feet are semi-zygodactyle, which means that the outer
toe is capable of being turned either backwards or forwards.
My hen Touraco laid another egg indoors during October, and again
hatched, but the parents got bored with the young, when it was three
weeks old, and it died one cold day at the beginning of December.

By J. Delacour
During the last year or more I have been so busy with different
matters, and especially with the writing of the four big volumes on
The Birds of Indo-China, that I find now that I have not sent to the
Magazine my usual notes on my birds at Cleres since 1929.
And yet so many species new to aviculture have been imported
during recent years and a few of these have come to me ! If we look
back ten years or more, how many birds which we had only dreamed
of seeing alive in our cages, aviaries, and parks, have now materialized !
If our dear former president, the late Mr. H. Astley, whom we all miss
so much, were still with us, what enthusiasm would he have shown
at the importations of species, which, in his days, were quite beyond
our avicultural hopes ! . . . But I must keep only to the few birds which
have come into my possession and I shall only speak of the novelties
which arrived at Cleres during the past two years, or which have been
bred there.
From the point of view of breeding, the weather of the last two
seasons has been especially bad, as it rarely ceased raining and was
nearly always cold and dull. It is only with very great and special
precautions that we managed to rear some young birds.
To start with the larger birds, we bred each season about ten

J. Delacour--Bird Notes from Cleres
White Rheas and the same number of grey ones, always taking the
chicks away from the male parent as soon as they were born, then
putting them into a chicken house heated by a coal brooder. We
hardly ever lose any in this way. I have one male and two female
Darwin's Rheas, a very rare species in captivity. In 1930 one hen
laid six eggs on which the cock sat for weeks in the rain ; the eggs
were clear, and the poor bird became so exhausted that he died
shortly after. Fortunately the Duke of Bedford kindly replaced him.
In 1931 one hen laid early in April a clutch of eight eggs, while the
other one was laying many undersized eggs with no yolks. The new
cock sat and eventually hatched two chicks, very pretty in their pearl-
grey and black down, with shortish bill, neck, and legs. Unfortunately,
by mistake, they were given wet green food with the result that one
soon died ; the other one somehow recovered but became rickety,
and did not survive more than three months. I hope to be more
successful next season.
My Pheasant collection is more or less complete. I have Argus,
Rheinart's and four species of Polyplectron : Palawan, Bronze-tailed,
Germain's and Ghigi's Grey ; a pair of the latter gave, this season,
eight clutches of two eggs, rearing six young. We also reared to full
size one Rheinart, for the first time in Europe, another dying at ten
weeks of a sudden attack of roup. The hen, which had been kept out
of doors the whole winter, started laying on 3rd May, again on 22nd May
and 12th June. Each time the second egg was laid from the perch
at night and broken. Incubation lasts twenty-five days. The chicks
have very showy white lines on the sides of the back and remind one
much in their ways of the young of Polyplectron. I had a pair of
Bulwer's Pheasants, but the cock died suddenly and I do not like the
look of the hen. I find that the Fireback group do not do well at
Cleres and it is not worth while keeping them there, although I still
possess pairs of the rare Borneo Crestless and&apos;of my own Fireback
[Lophura delacouri). But I now intend having them kept for me in
the sunny south of France.
Since 1928 I have kept a pair of the rare Lewis's Pheasants ( Gennaeus
lewisi), a very dark species of the silver group, discovered that same
year on the mountains of Cambodia. In 1930 the hen laid four

unfertile eggs. In 1931 she laid five, three of which hatched and two
young were reared. The chick looks like a small Silver Pheasant,
but darker, with reddish head. An imported pair of Mikado Pheasants
produced thirteen young ones in 1930, and the same number again
in 1931. This fine species from Formosa does not seem to breed before
two years old. I have just obtained another pair from Formosa which
will enable me to renew the blood.
I also own some wild-caught, and therefore pure-blooded, Amherst
Pheasants which I brought in 1930 from Yunnan. The wonderful
Blue Crossoptilons sent to me in 1929 by Mr. Hampe being all males,
hybrids with the brown species were reared last year and look almost
like pure blue ones. One of these 1930 hybrid hens bred, in 1931, two
young ones with a pure blue cock ; these are indistinguishable from
their father. In 1930 we reared some Soemmerring's Pheasants, a
few of which escaped from their coop and have become established
in the woods, where they are occasionally seen, together with some
Bel's Kalij. Unfortunately, the breeding hen died last year and the
cock, which was always quite harmless to her, would not accept a new
hen, and did his best to kill her. We saved her life, but all hopes of
breeding that species in 1931 vanished. During these two breeding
seasons we also reared a fair number of the following species : Monaul,
Brown Crossoptilon, Elliot's, Edward's, Imperial, Black-crested Kalij,
Horsfield's, Versicolor, Amherst Pheasants; Bed and Sonnerat's
Junglefowl ; Madagascar Guineafowl; Wild Turkeys; White and
Black-shouldered Peafowl. Brush Turkeys, kept in pairs, fought and
killed one another. The remaining birds, duly separated, built huge
nests, but we never saw any chicks. Some Doves and Pigeons were
bred: Diamond, Australian Crested, Bronze-winged, Jobi and
Marquesa ( rubescens ), and, for the first time since I have kept birds,
one Nicobar Pigeon. To my surprise, the young one remained nearly
six weeks in the nest, till quite fully grown. The collection of Water-
fowl is better than it ever was, although I must admit I have no more
Pink-headed Ducks, Pigmy Geese, African Black Ducks, White-
backed Ducks or Hottentot Teal, but among the larger Ducks and
Geese our series is fairly good with several pairs of each of such
rare species as Ashy-headed, Ruddy-headed, Blue-winged, Andean,

Sea Ducks are doing very well on our clear running water. There
are fifteen Eider and two Barrow's Golden-eyes, which feed greedily
on grain and mash, with dried meat. One pair of Common Scoters
have now lived for over three years and keep perfect condition, but they
seem to thrive on natural food only, while a male Velvet Scoter,
wounded at sea in August, has quite recovered and looks perfect ;
it has become fairly tame and feeds freely on grain and mash. These
quaint Sea-ducks are a decidedly interesting addition to the Duck
collection.
Many Cranes have laid eggs every year, but so far none have hatched
anything. I am sorry to say that the old Sams which had been free-
flying for more than ten years met with its death last summer, as it
struck a high-tension electric cable, some distance from the park.
There are in the park different full-winged Macaws and Amazons,
as well as one White-headed Caique and two Palm Cockatoos.
Some Stanley Parrakeets, several species of Lovebirds and
Budgerigars of all colours were reared, as well as different small birds
of moderate interest.
My indoor flights have been mainly filled lately with the rare species
of Waxbills and small Finches, while the greenhouse aviary, which
looks better than ever, holds many Sugar and Sunbirds, together with,
as special jewels, the lovely Forktail and Crimson-winged Babbler
(Henicurus leschenaulti and Garndax milni).
As I write, I am on my way to the Far East, and hope to return
in April or May with interesting specimens.

It has always been my great ambition to own some of these lovely
Parrakeets. Their beautiful colouring and tameness make them the
most delightful pets one can have. Last winter, I was offered a pair
by my friend Mr. Harvey, of Adelaide, and I was overjoyed, and at
once accepted the offer. In due course they arrived in absolutely
show condition about the first week of May. Every feather was
perfect and I have never seen birds look so well and healthy, proving
the amount of care and trouble that had been taken over them on the
voyage. As it was still cold I kept them in a cage in my bird-room
till about the end of May, when I turned them out into one of my
large Parrakeet aviaries. I gave them a nest-box about 6 feet long
with bark inside and outside, and this was filled with peat moss that
was damped, and over this I put in a few pieces of rotten wood. The
birds were so tame that the moment I walked into the aviary they
both came and settled on my shoulder, when I fed them with a few
mealworms. They had hardly been out a week, when I saw that they
were keenly interested in the nest, and the cock bird started feeding
the hen. Very soon after, four eggs were found in the nest, and the
hen bird was sitting well and the cock bird feeding her. All four
eggs were hatched early in July. The birds being very tame, I was
i able to look into the nest-box as often as I liked, without disturbing
them. The cock bird worked very hard, and kept on supplying the
hen with food all day long. About the end of August one sturdy
young bird left the nest, and in another few days they were all four
out. I have never seen more healthy young birds, and so strong on
the wing from the moment they left the nest. The hen fed the young
birds all day long, and from the moment she and her young left the
nest, the cock bird gave up feeding them, and always flew away when
any of the young came up to him for food. While nesting and feeding
young the Parrakeets were given the ordinary seeds, with a few
mealworms every day, also a lot of groundsel, chickweed, lettuce,

apple and growing wheat and oats from the fields, sometimes a piece
of sponge cake. By the end of September the young were almost
as large as the parents, but rather paler in colour, and, of course, the
tails were not quite so long. About the middle of October the four
young birds looked exactly the same as the adult birds, and were then
separated from the parents. In September when the young were fully
reared, the hen started to lay again, but as it was too late in the season,
I removed the nest-box from the aviary. As these birds are so rare
and have not been bred in Europe for years, I am more than delighted
with my luck and hope, now that I have such a good breeding pair,
that they wall keep up their reputation and breed every year. I have
never had birds settle down so quickly, and rear young so soon after
arrival, as this pair has done. These same birds had eggs several
times in Adelaide when Mr. Harvey had them, but no young were
ever reared, so I consider myself very lucky indeed. These birds
have given me the greatest pleasure in the world, especially as I have
been able to study them so closely right through the different stages
of breeding.

three years. This year I have given away eighty Zebra Finches and
fifty Blue Javas all bred in the aviary, and have a fresh supply to give
away. They breed too freely. I allow all the birds to breed as they
will, as in the three aviaries over 500 birds are at liberty. I will give
you a list of the birds with which I have been successful in the rearing
of young :--White Javas ; Spice Finches ; Grey and Green Singing

though we have, of course, various losses. Many more would increase,
but I have difficulty in procuring female birds. I have been able to
obtain various new birds since our local avicultural society was started,

London I saw wonderful birds at the Regents Park Zoo, which I

SICKNESS IN RARE PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99671196" page_id="56221779"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
I had hoped that the all too liberal experience of several years had
exhausted the supply of dangerous parrot diseases I was compelled
to become acquainted with--particularly diseases of an unpreventable
and incurable nature which attack acclimatized birds. However, a
bad summer and a new place has added another to the list--catarrhal
fever. One day in August I noticed that the Antipodes Island
Parrakeet appeared to have a discharge from the eyes and nostrils.
She may have been wrong some days before, but she was always a
bad bird to have ill, as she appeared to favour Christian Science ideas
and never departed from normal behaviour until half dead. Unlike
any other Parrakeet I have had, she would in the early stages of illness,
call, fly actively about, and stretch herself and continue to do so until
in a state of collapse.
I hoped that the trouble was only a kind of cold in the head and
put her in the warm hospital, spraying her head with glyco-thymoline
and water. She went off her seed, but ate plenty of apple and drank
plenty of egg and milk. Her bowels remained for a long time in fair
order, and she hung on to life for nearly a fortnight, but not the slightest
impression could we produce on the wretched microbe. The poor
bird's eyes and nostrils simply poured, and before she died her eyelids
were closed and swollen as in a bad case of eye disease. About a
fortnight later I was alarmed and disgusted to notice that my best
breeding hen King, a few aviaries away from the Norfolk Island&apos;s
late abode, had started the discharge from one eye and nostril. She
was in splendid bodily condition, very lively and very indignant at

the nostril with hydrogen peroxide and water and anointing it with
eucalyptus and vaseline and sanitas and vaseline. We also tried a
lotion and medicine recommended by a veterinary surgeon, with great
experience of parrots, but nothing was the slightest real good. There
was a little decrease in the discharge from the eye and nostril, but the
disease retreated deeper into the throat and bronchial tubes and the
King went the same way as the other victim. The cock with her,
who was caged and quarantined, did not develop the disease.
Fortunately there have been no more cases, and I am hoping that the
healthy low temperature of late autumn and winter will bring the
customary reduction in ailments. Incidentally the outbreak cost
me more Kings than the hen herself. At the time of her illness my
second hen was incubating a clutch of eggs, having already reared one
young one. As the cock with her was moulting when she laid and had,
in the past, proved a poor breeder, only fertilizing one egg in three
clutches during three years, I decided to remove the eggs so as not to
weaken the hen by long sitting and lower her vitality. When I broke
the four eggs, all proved fertile !

We have a very tame hen Pheasant that wanders about the place,
comes when called, sits in the hen-house and, in fact, does everything
a Pheasant should not do, the point being that one cannot mistake
this bird, or confuse her with another. She adds to her list of the
unusual by regularly rearing eleven young every year, being an excellent
mother. Now she has reared three broods. The first year, when the
young were just colouring, I saw her and called her and she answered--
when she had taken her brood, as the crow flies, about three-quarters
of a mile due west of this house and the grounds in wdiich she had sat
and brought them up. So I naturally took it that she had wandered
off and got lost and that would be the end of her. However, back she
came about the first week in October, but without her brood. Last

these were colouring, again took them away and I saw her with them

The question arises as to whether it is a regular habit of Pheasants
to take their broods off when old enough to look after themselves,

Is this Nature's way of preventing in-breeding ?

I have three mites of birds with tiny rings of orange round their
eyes, their mother being an Orange-cheeked, and their father a
St. Helena Waxbill. I have a true pair of Orange-cheeks and the
odd cock St. Helena (a large sized one) who lost his mate last winter.
The nest was built in an enormous box outside, just off the ground,
and there appeared to be two separate nests in this, full of feathers.
Nesting had gone on for some time and I thought the birds were
humbugging and as I wanted to bring them indoors as the nights were
very cold, I felt inside to make sure but found nothing, so there must
be still a third nest behind the other two ! The parents still go into
the nest with food so there may be yet another youngster.
They have been reared on nothing but seed and ordinary soft
food--no ants' eggs. My second pair of Orange-cheeks will not mate
together but one has paired with a Grey Waxbill for the last two years,
although this Grey is one of a pair.

GOULDIAN FINCHES

My first success in breeding the above-mentioned Finches was in 1922,
while in New Plymouth.
As my records of dates, etc., have been mislaid, I now come to my second
success, particulars of which are as follows :--
Early in January, 1929, I purchased three pairs of these beautiful birds,
which were immediately liberated into my aviary, comprising closed-in
portion, 6 by 6 by 3 feet, lined with ti-tree, and nest-boxes placed high

up near roof. The outside flight was 4 ft. 6 in. by 4 ft. 6 in. by 3 feet, and
covered with 4 in. netting on front and sides, with the top portion covered
in. The outside portion was raised from the ground some 2 ft. 6 in. with
wooden floor, covered with zinc, and was accessible for feeding and cleaning
from the back portion.
Now, to return to the real subject--the birds soon settled down to their
new quarters, and on the second day (12th January), one pair had commenced
to build their nest (built with hay and dried grass) : the nest-boxes were
6 by 6 by 6 inches, with small opening near top of the front portion,
and were well filled with the nesting materials, so much so that it was almost
impossible to see what was really happening. However, on the morning of
17th January, curiosity could hold out no longer, and on close examination
of the nest I was able to discern one egg (wdiite), and on each of the three
following mornings a further egg was found, making four in all.
Having succeeded this far, I did not interfere with the nest again, but
noted the date of commencement of incubation as 20th January; the birds
sat consistently, and each morning when entering the aviary, I noticed the
hen leave the nest, and the cock bird immediately flew to the nest-box, and
Avould allow r no one near. After a very anxious wait, imagine my delight,
when on the morning of 2nd February, I heard a faint squeak, and a few
mornings later it was evident the family had increased to at least three.
I did not take down the nest-box while the young were being reared,
and it was on 23rd February the first bird left the nest, the plumage being a
dusky green, without any of the bright marking of the adult birds. This was a
fine healthy youngster, and seemed quite strong in flight--this bird was
followed by three others, fine healthy youngsters, tw T o days later
(25th February), and all w 7 ere fed by both adults, but Avere able to feed
themselves in about ten days.
These notes, so far, have dealt Avith only one pair--the other two pairs
settled down equally well, but as the nest-boxes were more difficult to get at,
I did not deem it advisable to interfere, but am pleased to say that each
nest turned out three healthy youngsters (3rd and 6th March respectively.).
The adult birds soon settled doAvn again to nest building, but unfortunately
mice marred the success of the second round, and on entering the aviary one
morning I found the remains of eight youngsters, which episode closes part two.
Part three was equally as successful as part one, and from the three
nests nine young were reared, leaving the nests towards the end of April.
(Unfortunately record of dates has been lost).
Feeding .--These birds seemed quite easy to cater for--canary, white
and spray millet, with plenty of grass in flower--the latter two items were
greatly relished by the youngsters and they Avere indeed a pretty sight to
Avatch feeding from the bunches of grass seeds hung in various parts of the
aviary--fresh water w r as given each morning, and the birds, young and old,
always enjoyed their bath.
All the birds thrived well until the middle of June, when they sickened
and died off in about a week. This in my opinion was due to the weather
at this time being extremely Avet and foggy. After commencing the season
so well, a really sad ending--nevertheless, I hope these few notes will encourage
others (Avhen birds are available) to try their luck.

These birds were in my possession for a year or more before there was any
sign of breeding.
They made a nest in a covered-in prune box, with the bottom rounded
with plaster of paris into the shape of a nest, an opening about 3 inches
wide being left at one end.
The hen laid three eggs. Incubation took twenty-three days. The birds
succeeded in rearing one only, which remained in the nest until the hen
Parrakeet was thinking of laying again.
The young one left the nest on the 20th November, 1930. Its sex, a cock,
w r as denoted by the colour of the plumage, as soon as it came into the open.
The birds were fed upon the usual mixture for Parrakeets and Lovebirds
and in addition a large quantity of different kinds of seeding grasses, cocksfoot,
being one of the principal foods. I am confident that a plentiful supply of
natural seeds is essential to be successful.
It is also necessary to take the young ones away as soon as they are
independent, otherwise the cock will kill the young when the hen goes to
nest a second time.

large hollow punga stem for their nest.
This punga was end upwards on a shelf under a portion of the aviary
glassed over.
Three eggs were laid, and two young hatched after twenty-three days'
incubation. The young stayed in the nest until they w r ere able to fly and
w r hen they left the nest they were practically independent.
The young appear exactly the same as the hen and in spite of books saying
that the extra yellow about the head denotes a cock bird, I failed to notice
any difference. The young birds are most unusual in appearance when in the
pin-feather stage, for they seem to get their feathers all at once.
The first young one left the nest on the 21st October, 1930.
The food used was canary, millet, a great deal of hemp, occasionally
sunflower, a little green food and plenty of sow thistle heads.

It gives one some satisfaction to achieve a difficult object after many
trials and disappointments.
For two and a half years I have endeavoured to breed this difficult little
bird and have now succeeded in rearing four young ones.
They were hatched after fourteen days' incubation in a nest built in some
ti-tree from fine grass and feathers. It was dome-shaped with a small entrance

The young left the nest when they were sixteen days old. They were
light brown on the back, light blue on the chest, the red patches of the cock
bird being indistinguishable.
Immediately the young had flown, the hen went to nest again, leaving
the cock bird to look after the family. This he did by filLing his crop with
food and feeding two or three at a time, before obtaining more.
I first observed the young ones on the 14th May, 1931. I attribute my
success to feeding large quantities of very small gentles together with egg
and biscuit, cake, fruit, and the usual seeds. One food that seems essential
is the gentles.

I was most fortunate, some time ago, in securing a true pair of Parrot
Finches.
They built in a ti-tree bush, a small cup-shaped nest with, at the side, a
little tunnel through which the birds entered.
Three eggs were laid and two young hatched, but only one left the nest
on the 18th May, 1931. The young one grew rapidly and is now bigger than
its parents. It is green all over except for a little red patch on the rump
and a suspicion of pink on the head. On each side of the beak where the skin
joins at the base are two vivid light blue spots. As the bird became older
these spots disappeared and I can only conclude that they are of some use
to the parents when feeding the young in the dark interior of the nest.
The birds were fed upon hulled oats, plenty of lettuce, the usual range of
seeds for small Finches, and egg and biscuit mixed with Cod Liver Oil Cage
Bird Food.
The young one is now as quick and active as its parents.

In June, 1930, I was fortunate in acquiring three Pope Cardinals but it
was rather difficult to determine their sexes.
They were safely acclimatized and put out into the aviary in the spring,
1930. During September, two of the Cardinals were observed placing straws
in different positions, then taking them down again and transferring them to
other places. A little heavier nesting material, much of it composed of fine
twigs of ti-tree was put in their enclosure. The birds immediately seized
upon this and built a little platform in some ti-tree bushes in an exposed
position where sun and rain fell upon the nest. The nest was untidy, not
firmly knitted together and the sides were not high, more like the untidy
nest of a Dove.
Two green eggs were laid, spotted with faint brown. After about eighteen
days they hatched, but in a few days' time, only one bird remained. This

grew rapidly and in about fourteen days, left the nest. The quickness with
which this bird feathered and left the nest is remarkable.
It stayed in the vicinity of the nest being fed by the parents. It grew
rapidly but the head was coloured a dark tan in contrast to the red of the
parents. The rest of the colouring was similar to that of the adult birds.
The young one left the nest on 25th December, 1930, and is now almost full
size, although the head is still dark tan.
The parent birds were fed the usual mixture of seeds and in addition
green grass seeds and an ample supply of gentles and egg and biscuit meal.
Without the egg and biscuit and gentles, I think it is doubtful if these birds
could be reared successfully.

MASKED LOVEBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999583575757576" page_id="56221785"  page_num="17" year="" vol="">
Several pairs of these birds were imported but unfortunately owing to
disasters on the voyage, only two pairs arrived.
According to the information in books, they are supposed to settle down
and breed at once but this was not my experience. It was several months
after they were flying in the open before there was any sign whatever that
they were going to nest.
They chose a piece of punga log which had been hollowed out at one
end to about 6 inches in diameter and then boarded up. The opening
to this enclosure was the centre of the punga stem cleared of the soft fibre
found in the core.
The nest was made of short pieces of ti-tree bark which had been pulled
into shreds by myself. It is not unusual for the birds to bite this bark from
end to end to make it soft and before taking it up to the nest, to dip it into
the water vessel. They will use other things as well for nesting material,
stalks of grass, lengths of dock stem, pieces of old millet sprays and such
like. The majority of Lovebirds require moisture in the nest and the punga
stem was therefore hung from the roof of the aviary outside, exposed to the
weather. The ideal Lovebird nest is a decomposed damp bit of material
with at the top a thin layer of dry soft grass stems, etc. The grass stems are
not interwoven, similar to a Weaver's nest or even as a Zebra Finch's nest,
but are chewed up into short lengths and bedded down on to the coarser
material underneath by the weight of the bird's body.
The usual number of eggs is four, they being clear white oval eggs, the
same type as usually laid by birds of the Parrakeet or Parrot species. It is not
possible to give the exact time of incubation but it is somewhere about
eighteen to twenty-one days. The young remained in the nest for about four
weeks, and when they finally emerged on 30th June, 1930, they were perfect
in feathering and about two-thirds the size of their parents, and although
the breast of the adult is pure yellow that of the young has a tinge of red in the
yellow which is not replaced when the birds moult. The beak is red in colour,
like that of the parent, although slightly fighter in shade, and has a dark
brown, almost black, tip. When the bird is two or three months old, this
black usually disappears.

The birds were fed upon best grade white oats, a mixture of canary seed,
white millet, brown millet, and an occasional millet spray. The principal
food, however, is white oats, fed, of course, with the husk on, just as they
are bought. The birds used a great quantity of this when rearing the nest
of four.
The young birds were observed by several members of the Society who
commented on the fact that their plumage was even more perfect than that
of the parents, not a feather being out of place, and the plumage was as tight
as that of a Java Sparrow.

BLACK-CHEEKED LOVEBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993383594594595" page_id="56221786"  page_num="18" year="" vol="">
Two hens and one cock were received from England but the cock bird
on arrival, was in poor condition, and died after six months, never recovering
from the effects of the voyage.
A further cock bird was imported, but on the voyage had a dispute with a
hen Peach-faced Lovebird and the lady scalped him. Fortunately the injury
was only skin deep, and has not had any effect other than preventing any
further feathers growing on this patch about \ in. in diameter.
After several months he settled down and took to housekeeping with
one of the hens in a long hollow puriri log. The birds carted a great mass
of nesting material into this, practically filling the log with the exception
of a hollow at the far end and a tunnel from the hollow to the entrance.
All sorts of materials such as bark, coarse grass stems, millet sprays, and
other odds and ends usually found on the floor of an outside aviary were used.
The shape of the tunnel made to the actual nest through the log is peculiar.
From the entrance of the log to within a few inches of the nest itself, the
tunnel is fairly wide but on what is really the edge of the nest, material is
piled almost to the roof and a very small opening is made through which the
bird pushes its way from the tunnel to the nest. Quite likely it is a precaution
against the entrance of birds of prey, larger than the Lovebird itself.
Four eggs, the usual number, were laid, they being oval and white. The
Black-cheeked hen is an excellent mother, her eggs and chicks being her one
object in life. She sits remarkably closely, more so than the Masked variety.
The log was hung outside so that rain and weather would beat on it, for
Black-cheeks require a good deal of moisture in the lower parts of the nest
as otherwise the chicks have difficulty in breaking the membrane inside the
shell.
Three chicks eventually left the nest, but they were not completely
feathered, it being a couple of weeks after flying in the open before the feathers
on the rump were completely grown. The young Black-cheeks agree perfectly
with their parents, even after the hen has gone to nest again. The young
flew 10th August, 1930.
The birds were fed on Lovebird mixture with an extra quantity of white
millet and hulled oats with an occasional millet spray. They appreciate a
supply of green grass seeds of all descriptions and are particularly keen on
rape seed in the pod before it ripens. The young left the nest and are
thriving.

Misfortune seems to be the lot of this species, the birds not lasting any
length of time after arrival or else accidents happen with them. One bird
got out and lived at liberty for a couple of months but would never visit a
trap. Eventually two birds remained, and were put in an aviary by them-
selves, after spending the whole of the winter indoors. Fischer's Lovebirds
seem to be more susceptible to weather conditions than other species.
Strips of ti-tree bark, grass stems and wood wool, were provided. The wood
wool and ti-tree bark was used, the majority of the grass stems being ignored.
The birds apparently took a liking to the strips of wood wool, for they
commenced to tear off chips from the door of their aviary and when they had
reduced that to about half its original thickness, they transferred their
attempts at carpentering to a wooden ledge of their shelter house
reducing what originally was a piece of wood 1 |inches in height and
\ in. thick to a piece approximately f in. high. This piece must have
satisfied her ladyship for she immediately laid six eggs. Unfortunately
all were clear with the exception of one which ultimately developed into
a very handsome bird and left the nest on 9th January, 1931.
The nest was constructed in an hollow puriri log and the tunnel is a peculiar
shape, being of a larger diameter at the entrance and only large enough for
the bird to squeeze through in the front of the nest, with the added peculiarity
that, unlike many other Lovebirds, the entrance was to the side, not on top
of the nest. Why the birds should have a side entrance is difficult to say.
The birds were fed on Lovebird mixture with an additional amount of
brown millet, hulled oats, and white millet when feeding the young. They
were not keen on plain canary seed but relished an occasional millet spray.
They practically killed the root of a silver beet growing in their aviary in
feeding the one young bird.
The young are not so highly coloured as the adults, but otherwise similar,
the vivid red on the head appearing after the first moult.

Zebra Finch x Goldfinch Hybrid
I purchased a pair of Zebra Finches about the middle of last breeding
season and turned them into an outdoor aviary. When they had been in the
aviary about a week I noticed that one of the Zebra Finches was very friendly
with a Goldfinch hen. In about three days they showed signs of nesting by
carrying hay to a corner of the building. I then put some cow hair and kapok
in the aviary. When they had finished building they rested three days, on the
third day the Goldfinch went to nest and laid one egg and laid an egg every
other day until she had laid four eggs she then sat on the eggs and sat until
about two days of hatching, and then the Zebra Finch sat on the eggs. Then
the earthquake upset everything. I found chicks dead in the shells.
The Zebra Finch X Greenfinch habits were much the same as the

Extracts from Letters received from Australia
" I think the best plan to follow re the Blood Finches is to leave them to
themselves making the aviary as private as possible. They like a small nest-
box such as an old boot or jam tin or a hollow log. White ants are the best
live food but above all, do not look at them or at their nest. If you watch
some birds when nesting they will leave it and that may be the trouble that
they are not easy to breed. Tell the members to put their eggs under Zebras.
I bred a few in town and they built in a jam tin hanging on the wall.
Hungarian millet seed is the best for them. 55
" I have your letter, reference Blood Finches. You will find it fairly
difficult to get them to breed the first time but once they are started they
will be alright. I would suggest that you pair them off separately and keep
the room at a warmer degree as 65* seems very low. They breed here in
January, February, and March, and that is in our wet season when the
humidity is very high and probably if you could arrange to have your breeding
cage a little humid it might help matters. They are very fond of ants and
consequently in my cages, which are on ground level, there are always plenty
of ants travelling backwards and forwards. Mealworms should give the
same results.' 5

THE BLUE-WINGED GRASS PARRAKEET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9919485" page_id="56221797"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Edward J. Boosey
The Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet (Neonanodes chrysostomus) is a
comparatively soberly-coloured, and perhaps partly for that reason,
the least rare representative of a rapidly-dwindling family.
It inhabits South Australia, and is indigenous to Victoria and New
South Wales, visiting Tasmania for the summer and returning to the
mainland in the autumn, after the breeding season is over.
The coloured plate renders a description of the bird unnecessary.
That his beauty is not more fully appreciated, is in all probability,
chiefly due to the fact that the cock Blue-wing, when in repose, usually
sits with his chief glory--the wonderful deep sapphire blue wing-
patches--almost concealed beneath the overlapping greenish-yellow
breast feathers. Thoroughly to appreciate his beauty, therefore, he
must be seen in flight, or when fully alert.
Blue-wings are by no means difficult birds to cater for and should
be fed on a mixture of canary and millet, with a little oats and a very
small quantity of hemp. Both the latter can safely be increased when
the birds have young ones to feed, and at this period they also
appreciate a dish of their seed mixture previously soaked in water,
until it is just starting to sprout.

E. J. Boosey--The Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet
Millet spray, though probably not absolutely essential, is greatly
relished by all the Grass Parrakeets.
Blue-wings are, if anything, a trifle less keen on flowering grass than
are their near relations though, like most Parrakeets, they eat large
quantities of it at the approach of, and during, the breeding season.
It is as well, however, to keep them continually supplied with as much
of it as they will eat, and in winter the small Poa Annua grass, which
grows as a weed in gardens and flowers all the year round, is very
wholesome and an excellent standby.
Moisture in the nest is not a necessity for young Blue-wings, but
care should be taken that the box is not too deep as, like all Grass
Parrakeets, they are but poor climbers.
They can be kept in perfect health and bred in comparatively
small aviaries, which is an advantage from many people's point of
view ; also they are quite harmless to other species and do not damage
growing shrubs. If, however, they are kept in a mixed collection
with a number of small birds, it is absolutely necessary to keep their
quarters scrupulously clean, especially the perches as, like all their
family, they are rather liable to contract eye disease.
Though the writer has never kept Blue-wings in anything but a
separate aviary to themselves he would imagine that in a mixed
collection they would be very easily bullied by larger birds and,
judging by the extraordinarily little strength they have in their beaks--
they cannot bite wood and, when handled, only nibble feebly at one's
fingers--they would certainly be quite defenceless.
They are active in the early morning, sit quietly most of the day,
and are extremely lively again just before dusk. In fact, in a collection
of Parrakeets, the members of the Grass Parrakeet family will usually
be found to be flying happily about, particularly on fine summer
evenings, long after all the rest of the collection have gone to
roost.
Young Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets were successfully reared
here, at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm, during the past season.

I thought it might be of interest to record some further notes on
the breeding of my Black-headed Sibias.
The original birds which first reared young in 1925 have surpassed
themselves in 1931 in spite of the bad weather. Their aviary is
situate in a garden which is within a short distance of bus and tram
routes, but which has the merit of being fairly open for a London
garden.
In the middle of April the usual opening was made in the wire of
this aviary. The birds had already gone to nest and the hen was sitting
on two eggs. For some reason, known only to the birds, the nest was
suddenly deserted ; it was decided, however, to allow them to continue
their freedom. Shortly afterwards a neighbour informed me that some
strange birds, they presumed belonged to me, were busy building a nest
in a fir-tree close to their sitting room window. They told me they
would watch the birds and do their best to prevent any marauders,
such as cats or squirrels, interfering with them. The nest was completed
and three eggs were laid--everything appeared to be going on well.
Suddenly, however, the hen bird failed to appear for her food and was
not seen for two or three days. The nest had been constructed close
to a fence and I feared that a cat had put an end to all dreams of young
Sibias. The nest had been tipped up and three broken eggs were found
at the foot of the tree. The hen, however, was still alive and was seen
once again carrying nesting material. This failure was due probably
to grey squirrels, of wdiich there are many about and which some
people will feed although they would be terrified at the thought of
having anything to do with their first cousins the rats.
The position of the third nest was in a monkey-tree in a near-by
garden. Everything here appeared to progress satisfactorily. After
about three weeks both birds were busy taking mealworms away back
to the nest--so far, so good. Suddenly, they ceased to be interested
in mealworms except for their own consumption. What had happened ?
Three young fledgelings were found at the foot of the tree, dead. A
Blackbird had a nest only about 2 feet away from the Sibias and it

A. Slier riff -- Black-headed Sibias at Liberty
would appear that the latter, inclined at all times to be quarrelsome
with other birds when nesting, took exception to the proximity of the
Blackbirds' nest. What took place must be left to the imagination,
but the result was certainly unfavourable to the Sibias.
Considerable time had now been wasted, three nests had been built,
eight eggs laid, and still no young birds to show : the time about the
middle of June. However, this pair of birds did not intend to be
demoralized by previous failures, and, very shortly after, the hen again
commenced building in a large pear-tree. This time all was well. In
about five weeks two young Sibias were flying about the garden followed
and being fed by their parents.
After the young had been flying for about three weeks the hen again
became conspicuous by her absence. Another nest ? What was going
to happen to the young birds now flying. If left free would the parents
drive them away ? Eventually it was decided if possible to catch
up the two young birds, and this was done with great ease as the parents
had carefully shown them the way into the aviary.
It was now certain that a further nest had been built. The hen
was seen only once when the gardener fed them at the usual time,
about 9a.m. I have not been able to satisfy myself whether the previous
nest was used again or not, but it was certain that the hen was
incubating. Once more mealworms were being carried, and by the
end of August three young Sibias were enjoying themselves in weather
which at that time was not too bad. It did not seem possible that
any further nesting could take place and I intended to catch up the
three young birds as opportunity afforded. This was done without
the slightest trouble and the cock continued to feed the young birds
through the wire of the aviary in which they were enclosed.
But where was the hen ? She had actually gone to nest again.
It was now the third week in September and the possibility of early
frosts could not be ignored, but bad as the weather has been with regard
to sunshine there had as yet been little real cold. About the
10th October two more youngsters were introduced to their paternal
home and this week, the last in October, they have been caught up and
placed with their relations. The parent birds are in a dilapidated state
due to their excessive zeal for nesting. They appear, however, to be

quite healthy and are now being given a delicacy of which they and lots
of other insectivorous birds thoroughly approve, viz. warm condensed
milk and honey. I propose to allow them their liberty throughout
the winter. Since the last young were caught up they have kept
continually in the aviary. Last year they wintered without artificial
heat in an aviary that had a closed shelter to it. They were not alone,
for two young were reared in 1930 and one bird was purchased. They
are unquestionably hardy and according to Whistler's handbook of
Birds of India keep quite close to the snow line.
Of all the insectivorous birds that I have ever kept I have found
Black-headed Sibias the most interesting and entertaining. In no way
timid, quick as lightning and always on the look out for mealworms.
In fact, when feeding the young it was difficult to walk down the garden
without one of the birds flying within an inch of one's nose and plainly
saying " I want mealworms ". At odd moments the cock would play
games with his children through the wire. They are very affectionate
towards one another as a rule, but in one case I have had to separate
by hand the present cock from one of his sons, otherwise death would
have resulted to one or the other. The last two young delighted,
however, in chasing Sparrows, and on one occasion I was astonished
and worried to see three young Sibias on a tree in the Finchley Road,
but they were back for lunch. *
There are now twelve Sibias in the aviary. For the purpose of
getting new blood I am anxious to exchange one or two, and, should
anyone wish to try to breed these birds, will be only too pleased to lend
one or two of this year's young. Once accustomed to an aviary they
can safely be allowed their freedom.
This year the hen has laid fifteen eggs and reared seven
young. The cock has been in the aviary for eight years and the
hen for six.
[Writing on 23rd December, Mr. Sherriff says " The parent birds
are still at liberty and up to recently have slept in the garden, but since
the present advent of cold weather have spent the night in the shelter.
The young birds have, up to now, slept out in the aviary flight."-- Ed.]

Few aviculturists, I imagine, will look back on the results of the
past summer with much satisfaction. In my own collection it has
been chiefly conspicuous for disappointments. Clear eggs from nearly
all the rarer birds and an amount of rickets among nestlings as
unexpected as it was unwelcome ; the appearance of a new and fatal
disease and quite abnormal losses from straying among liberty birds ;
in fact, mental and physical demoralization all round ! Even the
unusual geniality of November did more harm than good by keeping
the microbes of enteritis and pneumonia rampant beyond their proper
time.
The nesting attempts of some of the rarer birds have already been
recorded, so I will confine this article to an account of the doings of the
rest of the collection.
A Crimson-wing paired to the last of my Sula Island King x
Crimson-wing hybrids incubated three clutches of eggs, but all proved
infertile. The hybrid, now in adult plumage, is the finest specimen
I have had of this most beautiful cross, of which a rather poorly-
coloured example is to be seen at the Zoological Gardens.
A very old Lutino Ringneck spent some weeks in her nest but did
not lay ; I fancy her breeding days are done.
An Amboina King paired to a cock Salwatty--exactly like her
but a much smaller bird--did not go to nest, but as she had only
arrived late the previous autumn she had hardly time to settle down.
I find the beautiful Asiatic Kings the hardiest Parrakeets in my
collection and less susceptible to cold or disease than any other birds.
My cock Many-colour died of septicaemia just when he was coming
into breeding condition. I put the hen with a hybrid Mealy Rosella
X Pennant, but she was rather afraid of him, and I am doubtful if
they actually paired. Anyhow, her eggs were infertile.
The Lutino Amazon raised my hopes by coming into breeding
condition and inspecting a nest, but the accursed Koko, her green
mate, a demon with human beings, repeated his foolish trick of the
previous season, and dropped into an unnecessarily premature moult.

The Roseate Cockatoos were another disappointment. The hen
apparently settled down in the barrel in which she reared two families
with a Common Grey cock, but at the last moment she deserted it,
and laid her egg from the perch in the aviary shelter. She then
arranged splinters of wood round the broken fragments as a sort of
funeral wreath, and proceeded to fall into moult, her white husband
soon following.
A pair of Hooded Parrakeets were provided with an artificial
termite mound. They followed their usual annoying habit of moulting
all summer and beginning to take a serious interest in the nest at the
end of September, three days before it had to be removed. At the
end of December the hen laid five eggs on the floor of the shelter
but none hatched, though two were fertile.
My old hen Sula Island King I mated with a cock Princess of Wales,
but just when they were getting friendly I had to remove him as he
was wanted for a hen of his own species. Later I put a Princess of
Wales X Crimson-wing hybrid with her, but he did not like her and
her eggs were infertile.
My breeding cock Malabar having died the previous winter, I was
reduced to using another who has the tiresome habit, at the beginning
of each breeding season, of biting off all his flight feathers until he is
unable to fly an inch. He repeated his absurd trick at the exact
moment when he was required to take up domestic duties. The hen
sat patiently on three eggs, but directly she discovered that no family
would reward her labours, she came out and fell upon her scarecrow
partner, biting him seriously in the mouth and beak. I could hardly
blame her !
I have three pairs of Lutino-bred Ringnecks which annually provide
material for hope ending in disappointment. A pair which hitherto
have never got further than hatching one chick reared two quite nice
young---a Lutino and a Green. The Green injured itself fatally soon
after leaving the nest, and a few days later the Lutino was found
completely paralyzed in both legs. It fed well on soft food, however,
and slowly began to regain the use of its feet until there seemed good
prospects of a complete cure. Unfortunately, these did not materialize ;
one leg got quite sound but the other went back and the foot became

useless, so I was obliged to give the bird away as a pet. It is,
I suppose, the first Lutino fully reared in confinement, so it is all the
more sad it should be a cripple. It is a lovely colour, with red eyes.
The second pair of Lutino-breds had only one egg, which was
infertile. The difficulty of breeding Lutinos is augmented by the fact
that my stock of Lutino-bred Greens seem all to be firm believers in
birth-control, never laying more than two eggs and never having
more than one nest in a season. The third pair, which have already
produced two Lutinos which died after leaving the nest, had two Green
young ; one died when half grown. The other was reared, but is not
a perfect flyer.
A lutinistic cock Plumhead (a pure Lutino for a time at an earlier
period in his career, but pied in early youth and at the present time)
mated to a yellowish-green hen had four normally coloured young.
In spite of the fact that the old birds ate enormous quantities of
sprouting seed and seed dripping in cod liver oil, three of the young
birds were very rickety. One died soon after leaving the nest. Two
improved greatly and were able to fly for some weeks, but the advent
of cold weather in November killed them as they were stupid about
using their heated shelter. The survivor is a fair specimen. I find
that young Plumheads have a fairly heavy body moult their first
autumn in the course of which they acquire quite grey heads.
A Lutino Alexandrine Parrakeet sat in her nest but did not lay.
She is unfortunately a cripple, with frost-bitten toes and a damaged
wing.
The Princess of Wales Parrakeets had infertile eggs. The rather
old imported cock I first tried with the hen would not pair, though
very attentive in every other way. The second cock, bred by
Mr. Astley, paired but would never feed her. A rather curious
incident took place when the hen was about to lay, illustrating
the strong desire that cock Polyteline Parrakeets display to
oblige their wives to attend properly to home duties, a
desire which has nothing whatever to do with sexual instinct.
The hen Princess of Wales, though obviously on the point of laying,
was not over taken with her nest and would come off at any and every
excuse. I had noticed for some days that her reluctance to settle down,

had been getting on her husband's nerves and he chattered irritably
each time she flew out. The crisis arrived on the afternoon before the
night on which the first egg was due to appear. On some trivial excuse
the hen came off yet again. It was too much for the cock's patience,
and he fairly lost his temper and attacked his partner furiously, driving
her about until she was quite exhausted and, hitting the wire heavily,
fell to the ground. I shut him into the aviary shelter and very nearly
removed him altogether, but trying them together half an hour later
I found that his anger had cooled down. She, however, was too bruised
and upset to go back to the nest, and during the course of the night
laid her egg from the perch and broke it. Two days later, however,
she took to the nest properly and although the cock addressed a few
unpleasant remarks to her if, in his opinion, she came off too frequently
to feed, there was no more real trouble.
A pair of Stanleys came more or less into breeding condition, but
never really settled down. Later I tried the cock at liberty as he was
rather a poor specimen, but though he returned a few times to his
aviary, he soon strayed--a most unusual occurrence for a mated
Broadtail.
A pair of Barnards did nothing at all, though in excellent health.
I rather think that the hen is sterile from age. The Barnardius
crommelincB whose sex was for a long time uncertain, finally decided
to be a cock, but was unsuccessful in inducing his partner to do more
than explore her log.
My old breeding pair of Crimson-wings reared four fair young.
One strayed and was lost the first day it was given its liberty. The
others are still about. The adult cock, however, was lost in the
strangest and most inexplicable way. He was one of my oldest trained
liberty birds and so intelligent that I could get him in or out of an aviary
at almost any time I chose. For many seasons at Warblington, and
last winter here, he had enjoyed his liberty when not engaged in
domestic duties and being, for a Crimson-wing, an unusually devoted
husband, he never left his mate's aviary for more than a few minutes.
This autumn, as usual, I turned him loose one calm day and he flew
quietly off in company with his last year's young one. I never saw
or heard of him again ! I can only assume that the young hen, whose

knowledge of the country was greater than his own, took him for a
fly round and got separated from him and he failed to find his way
home. A second pair of Crimson-wings had very rickety young,
which eventually died.
A hen King, paired to a cock that had been kept too long in close
confinement to be fertile, laid and incubated three clutches of eggs, and
then fell a victim to catarrhal fever. The cock also died of pneumonia.
Another pair of Kings that had previously failed to produce fertile
eggs reared one fine strong young one, now a trained liberty bird with
its father. As it has already got a red beak it is presumably a male.
The hen laid again and her eggs were fertile, but alarmed at the fate
of the other I did not allow her to risk her health by too prolonged
family duties.
Both my Long-tailed Parrakeets have been lost. One died in
April. I had reduced the heating of the aviary shelter and it did not
occur to my aviary attendant to increase it again when a very cold
spell set in.
The other cock paired with a Malabar Parrakeet and fed her but
he died of pneumonia in early June. I fear, therefore, that I must
return to my original opinion that this handsome species is unsuited
to aviculture in temperate climates and is not worth importing.
A pair of Pennants, usually parents of exceptionally fine and fertile
young, only produced rickety ones which did not long survive.
A pair of Browns lost their young when a few days old although
the cock has bred good stock in previous seasons.
Yellow-rumps did fairly well, rearing five young, but for the first
time had no second nest.
Rosellas had extremely rickety young, but the hen is a poor specimen
and has only once reared a good youngster.
Among three pairs of Barrabands, one hen had gone on strike for
about nine years because the nest I gave her did not appeal to her
imagination. She came into breeding condition regularly, but would
not lay. This year I decorated her home with bark inside and out,
which so appealed to her aesthetic sense that she laid again and reared
three fine youngsters. One unfortunately escaped when I was entering
the aviary, but after staying about for a day flew clean away and was

lost--again an unprecedented misfortune, for of the dozens of young
Barrabands I have trained for liberty not one has ever deserted his
parents when first released.
A second pair got no further than looking at the nest. The cock,
like so many aviary-bred Barrabands, would do everything but mate.
The cock of the third pair had rather a peculiar history. He was brought
up by the Sula Island King and her Crimson-wing mate together with
their own hybrid offspring, his own parents having died while he was
still an egg ! His unusual upbringing has affected his whole character
and conversation. He talks Crimson-wing and even now greatly prefers
the society of Crimson-wings, being, for a Barraband, an unusually
inattentive husband to his Barraband mate, who was my choice rather
than his. Nevertheless, when he was with her in the summer he did
his duty by his home though the only eggs in his nest that hatched were
two of a Eock Peplar. One of the young Eock Peplars died in the
nest; the other was reared and is a trained liberty bird, but is not
a good specimen. The mother of this youngster is a most idiotic bird
and a great source of trouble to her mate and myself. Every year she
ignores his entreaties and curses and refuses to look at the endless
variety of nests I submit for her approval. What she really likes doing
is laying her five eggs one by one from the perch in the shelter. This
year I shut her out of the shelter and she laid her eggs from the perch
in a corner of the flight, breaking two. Finally, by way of adding insult
to injury, she proceeded, for three weeks, to incubate, on the aforesaid
perch, the abstract idea of the five eggs, two of which were in fragments
and the other three under the Barraband !
A pair of Eedrumps at liberty reared four young cocks. They then
flew to the other side of Kent and reared two more, being caught in
late autumn by a person who sold them to a local fancier who showed
no inclination to part with them. This, again, is quite unprecedented
conduct in liberty Eedrumps, which, as long as they are paired, are
most faithful stayers.
The young cocks, while in immature plumage, were so uncivil to
the hens I turned out for them that the latter did not stay ; but as
soon as they assumed adult plumage they strayed in search of mates
as all unpaired Eedrumps do !

Some common Ringnecks intended as foster parents reared three
young of their own, which were given away as pets.
The big hen Banksian, formerly the property of Mrs. Anningson,
laid twice and sat well but her eggs were infertile.
Bib Finches and Zebra Finches at liberty reared a few young as
probably did the Orange Weavers. The latter stayed well and made a
pretty show, one especially obliging cock taking up his residence in
the vegetable garden and allowing parties of visitors to stand and admire
him from a distance of a few yards. My small liberty birds did so
exceedingly badly last winter when I began to keep them partly shut in
that this season I decided to let them take their chance, merely feeding
them into the heated shelter and furnishing it cosily with branches
and boxes. To my surprise quite a number have voluntarily left their
outside roosting quarters and taken advantage of the accommodation
provided for them inside the shelter.

I was most interested in the Marquess of Tavistock's article on
Softbills which appeared in the October number, and at the risk
of bringing a " ton of bricks " on my head I am going to state that
Softbills are the most enjoyable and interesting birds in aviculture.
A few Parrots and many Seedeaters have inhabited the aviaries
during the past ten years together with Softbills, but somehow Parrots
and Seedeaters always seemed to decrease while the numbers of
insectivorous birds increased. Naturally I am referring to conditions
in which only a limited number of birds can be adequately housed.
Of course, if money and space are of no consequence any and every bird
would be welcome. Let me admit that my experience of Parrots is
too limited for them to be included in this article.
Seedeaters never appear to become " personal in a way in which
a Softbill will. By " personal " I mean that one ordinarily does not
expect a Seedeater to come to the hand for a special fine grain of canary

seed or for a juicy bit of lettuce. A Softbill will, in due course,
appreciate tbe offer of a mealworm, a spider, or possibly a piece
of meat.
The article referred to above appeared to suggest that Softbills
were as easy to keep as Seedeaters. I have not found it so. For the
latter the best seed is always obtainable and nothing but the best should
be used. Seeding grass when in season, millet sprays, and some green
food will probably suffice to keep the majority in reasonable health.
For Softbills the food must be more varied and, in the winter parti-
cularly, it becomes increasingly difficult to find suitable live food. The
insect food has to be prepared with care, and consists of many component
parts. I have never actually tried Sunbird mixture, no doubt it corre-
sponds closely to the insect food used at the Zoo. This is the mixture
which I use--it is very excellent. Mealworms are to some extent
useful, but in the summer are inclined to be too fattening and heating.
Considering that mealworms are fed mainly on biscuit meal the amount
of nourishment in them cannot be very large ; and often in the summer
if required for feeding young birds (if any) they become increasingly
scarce and expensive. Gentles are at times useful, but are themselves
difficult to keep for any length of time.
Again, nearly all Softbills require fruit. Currants soaked in hot
water, oranges, ripe pears, and grapes, but I have found that only
white grapes are really enjoyed. Banana too is eaten, but this fruit
is possibly rather too fattening and certainly makes the perches, etc.,
very dirty.
In winter or during any sudden spell of cold weather, unsweetened
condensed milk to which is added plenty of honey and mixed with a
little warm water is a real delicacy. Even the larger birds such as
Sibias, Fairy Blue Birds and others thoroughly relish it. The smaller
Softbills are kept supplied with it from the end of October to the end
of March.
Also some of the larger birds appreciate raw meat cut up into tiny
pieces with scissors and mixed with insect food. Shamas, Drongos, and
even King Birds of Paradise were in the habit of picking the meat out
before eating anything else. Possibly to some extent it replaces the
live insect food which normally they would obtain.

Of course, these are only personal experiences, other people may
have found differently.
To summarize, there is little doubt, leaving out the question of
" comparative 5 5 mortality, that, from a food point of view alone, Soft-
bills require more care than Seedeaters, but they are certainly worth
the extra trouble.
The Marquess of Tavistock has mentioned his experiences with Fairy
Blue Birds. I was luckier apparently in so far as the only two I ever
possessed were a true pair. They are most interesting birds but,
like some of the Bulbuls, are rather loose-feathered. Unfortunately,
owing to lack of space they never had an opportunity to go to nest
as they were always together with eight or ten other birds. The hen
became very tame indeed, and would take mealworms, meat, or grapes
from the fingers. She, at various times, used to carry nesting material,
but owing to the reason stated above nothing developed.
A pair of King Birds of Paradise lived well for a long time,
but eventually the cock succumbed, I believe to Polyneuritis, in spite
of continuous treatment. The hen certainly made an attempt to go
to nest by carrying nesting material into a hollow tree-trunk nesting
box but, maybe owing to the cock not being completely fit, nothing
further happened, though he used to display to the hen regularly.
The above is interesting for, I believe, until quite recently the
nesting habits of this Bird of Paradise were unknown and even their
eggs had never been obtained.
Mr. Frost informed me quite recently, however, that he had been
successful in getting the King Bird of Paradise to lay eggs and that the
nesting box used was a hollow tree trunk. This, I believe, took place
in Singapore.
The hen was always much more lively than the cock, even when
they first arrived, and is alive now.
I have never yet kept any of the Sun Birds but hope to do so
one day.
Sugar Birds, however, are very interesting and very beautiful.
A pair of Blue Sugar Birds, which had been in the aviary for some
considerable time, caused great excitement one summer by going to
nest, but unfortunately, out of five eggs laid in two nests, not one was

fertile. The hen was finger-tame and possibly this may have had some-
thing to do with it.
Experiences with a pair of Black-headed Sugar Birds were quite
heartbreaking. They were in a large aviary to themselves and to
my delight and surprise I found a nest about 4 feet off the ground with
two eggs. The hen sat tight, but was particularly careful never to
return to the nest if anyone was about. In due course two young
hatched. At about mid-day a thunderstorm with tropical rain washed
nest and young away.
Again a nest was built, two eggs laid, two young hatched. Three
days afterwards another thunderstorm worked the same havoc.
Subsequently I perforce had to give up many of my birds, but
strangely enough have succeeded in obtaining again the original pair
of Black-headed Sugar Birds. Perhaps the elements will not be so
unkind next time.
Of some of the larger insectivorous birds may be mentioned the
Racket-tailed Drongo--a wonderful mimic, fairly easily tamed,
marvellous at catching mealworms in the air, and quite hardy.
I have not found them particularly spiteful, though unquestionably
individuals vary, and they are inclined to snap out at any smaller
bird that flies near them.
The African Roller makes a wonderful splash of colour in an aviary
when he once gets over his early nervousness.
Bulbuls, Shamas, Pekin Robins, and Mesias are all delightful, but
I have never yet succeeded in rearing the young of any, though nests
have been made, eggs laid, and the young hatched off in each case.
It may be interesting to mention here a larger White-eared Bulbul
which is kept in a cage in the house. This is sometimes miscalled the
Persian Bulbul, but the latter is, of course, a warbler.
He is extraordinarily tame and spends most of his time displaying
to himself in the looking-glass in the sitting room ; a habit of which
he never tires.
I cannot close this article without mentioning two birds which
for about two years were a continual source of joy. Two tiny Softbills
with erectile crests, brown in colour and about the size of a White-eye.

Arrival of the Splendid Grass Parrakeet
and habits. I am referring to what are to my mind very rare birds
for I have only seen three, the Black-chinned Yuhina. These tiny
birds appear to be quite hardy and at one time looked like going to
nest. This was obviously impossible as subsequently they were found
to be two hens. Their end was extraordinary. They were in a compart-
ment to themselves and in the next compartment were a few Seedeaters.
It is only possible to attempt to reconstruct what took place.
Apparently the perch on which the Yuhinas were in the habit of sleeping
projected a few inches into the adjoining compartment. During the
night, presumably, a Parrot Finch dropped dead off its perch and in
falling must have hit the protruding end of the branch on which the
Yuhinas were roosting. The shock caused them to fall into the water
trough, where they were found dead in the morning.
There was certainly no more than \ in. of water in the trough,
so drowning can be ruled out. In any case the subsequent post
mortem could reveal no cause for death. Presumably, it must there-
fore have been shock.
The third bird was in a very bad condition when purchased and
died shortly after.
One other point and this about Parrots. Restrictions are easily
imposed but it is far harder to obtain their removal. The ban on
Parrots owing to Psittacosis has been in force for some considerable-,
period now. Will it, like some of the relics of D.O.R.A., continue
ad infinitum ?

In the Magazine for November, 1931, the arrival was reported of
some half-dozen examples of Neophema splendida in Adelaide, and
since that we have read in the daily papers that a pair of these birds
was coming to England for His Majesty the King. These have now duly
arrived, having actually reached our shores on 9th January, and by the
kindness of Mrs. Fetherstonhaugh, who is taking charge of them, I
have had the privilege of seeing them, and they are certainly quite as
beautiful and in other ways as delightful as one had always pictured

them to be. They remind one strongly of Turquoisines, to which
they are, of course, closely allied, but the scarlet chest of the cock bird
is most conspicuous and striking, though he lacks the red shoulder
stripe of the cock Turquoisine.
The Splendid Parrakeet was always considered a rare bird, though
some sixty years ago it was not unknown to aviculturists in Europe.
The only pair the Zoological Society appears to have possessed arrived
just sixty-one years ago, and from these a young bird was hatched
the following year though whether this was reared to maturity or not
I have been unable to discover.
The species has its home in South and South-Western Australia,
but, apparently, it is very local in its distribution, for it seems to have
entirely disappeared for sixty years or so.
When in Western Australia twenty-four years ago I met most of
the ornithologists there and enquired as to the existence or present
status of Neophema splendida , but no one had heard of it for many
years past, and all seemed to think that it had disappeared for good.
That the species still existed was proved towards the end of 1928 when,
so Dr. Hamilton informs me, an aboriginal living at Koonibha, a mission
station at the north of the Gulf in South Australia, found a small Grass
Parrakeet that had flown into a wire fence and broken a wing. It died
and was sent to the Adelaide Museum where it was identified as a
specimen of Neophema splendida.
Now that this lovely species has reappeared it is greatly to be hoped
that every endeavour will be made to propagate it by breeding in
captivity, for there is little doubt that it will prove to be quite ready
to breed if given suitable conditions. D. S-S.

use now that The Zoologist is a thing of the past, and as there is no
proper index to the series the large amount of valuable information
contained therein is very inaccessible.
In The Zoologist, vol. 1 for 1892, p. 341, Herr Bertel Christensen,
of Copenhagen, tells us that in 1890 his Sand Grouse (Syrrhaptes
paradoxus), had laid fertile eggs but unfortunately they did not hatch.
However, in 1891 he had better success, and obtaining nine eggs he
placed them under a bantam, but most of these seem to have been
smothered by the hen. However, on 6th August two chicks hatched
out and were promptly put into a fostermother. Owing to improper
feeding one died on 11th August. " Unfortunately I thought too late
of trying them with grass and clover-seed. The survivor thrived well
on this and is now (9th April, 1892) in the best of health and very
tame."
Herr Christensen seems to have been a pretty good aviculturist
as he speaks of hatching out, under this same bantam, Chinese and
Francolin Quails both of which he seems to have fed on moistened
ants' eggs mixed with egg-bread, yolk of egg and bruised millet-seed.
It is evident from the above that the parents of this Sand Grouse
were part of the great eruption which took place over Western Europe
in 1888 reaching the British Isles and breeding here in the wild state.

MASKED LOVEBIRDS

In a recent number of the Avicultural Magazine you asked
for experiences of members with young Masked Lovebirds leaving the
nest not fully fledged.
One pair of Masked Lovebirds in particular, in my own aviaries,
that always have perfectly feathered young ones, live in an enclosure
well covered with grass, principally cocksfoot, prairie grass, and rye.
The birds regularly chew up the leaves of the grass leaving only the
fibre in the form of a little pellet on the ground. When they have
young in the nest, they eat some of the root of sugar beet growing in
their aviary.
In another aviary there are two pair of Masked Lovebirds whose

young are the same as those complained about. It is noticeable that
this aviary is not so well covered with grass, nor do the birds take the
interest one would expect in seeding grasses thrown in to them. I
suggest that the perfectly feathered birds in one nest are caused by the
large quantities of grass consumed by the parent birds.
Shortly I hope to have an opportunity of proving this theory by
shifting those pairs which usually have imperfectly feathered young
to another well-grassed aviary.

A CURIOUS HYBRID
In reply to the query by Sir David Ezra, in the November number
(p. 322), as to whether the cross between the Java Sparrow and
Bengalese has been produced in England, the answer, as far as my
Records go, is in the negative, though since these were published
(1926), I have been able to add a record from Japan given in Hachisuka's
Variations Among Birds (Tokyo, November, 1928) of this cross
having been recently bred in the Marquess Yamashima's aviary in
Tokyo.
I should be interested to learn if Sir David Ezra knows where the
birds represented were bred, for it seems quite likely that they were a
later brood from the same collection.
Among other hybrid records among similar birds new to me given
by Hachisuka from these aviaries are :--

ON BEING A BIRD ONE'S-SELF
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998428264705883" page_id="56221816"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
It was in our Magazine, I think, that I was first honoured by-
being called a poet in so many words in print (in 1923) ; and this, and
the fact that you, who were thus kind, have been asking for copy,
emboldens me to write, much against my will, about myself, since I
cannot get the answer I want anywhere but in this Magazine, and a
poet is often--especially by himself !--compared to a bird. There is, I
think, a good deal in the comparison, for personally, when I have had
the fit on, I have known no more than a bird what I was going to say,
nor do I know whether I can write verse on a given subject any more
than a mocking or talking bird knows whether he can reproduce a given
sound that takes his fancy. There is also the element of rivalry common
to both birds and bards, and the inspiration gained from the opposite
sex--especially if remote, for poets do not seem to get inspiration from
their wives, and birds, we know, are apt to go off song when happily
mated. I, alas ! am now going off song, while likely to die a bachelor ;
but I am always the scientist first, and what I want to know is whether,
when one has the verse-fit on, one has knowledge of subjects not
obtained in the ordinary way. And as I have written mostly on birds,
the subject is linked to some extent with our study of them.
What I have found is that, having availed myself now and then of
poetic licence so far as to make statements which I should not have
made in prose, I have afterwards found that there was justification
for the same.
In writing " Circe and the Wildfowl," I talked of the swan singing
his own dirge while giving the well-known display, and thought that
here I was combining attributes of the Mute Swan and the Whooper,
which last has been known to sing--or rather trumpet--before its
death. But years after writing this piece in 1923, only a year or two
ago in fact, I saw an account in the correspondence columns of Country
Life of a Mute Swan, in two instances, uttering musical sounds before
its death, due in the one case to illness and in the other to injury.
So the old legend about the swan singing before death is proved in the
case of the most familiar and picturesque species.

imply that an eagle would strike at a Curlew, though I thought such
an active bird would hardly be noticed by such a large, cumbrous bird
of prey ; but I have since read (I forget where) of a case in which a dead
Curlew was found in an Eagle's nest. I also implied in the same piece
that Crows would follow an Eagle in the hope of booty, though I knew
of no such case ; but I have since read of one--I think in the Shooting
Times . In the Skylark&apos;s challenge to the Nightingale in the same
piece, I think I have got the rhythm of the bird's song in the last three
lines :--
" The Nightingale can never be
Rival of heaven's bard like me,
He owes to night men's eulogy."
This was quite unconscious on my part, and quite unconsciously,
too, I now find that in " Stormcock's Saga " I have got that of the

The rhythm of the bird's flight was what was in my mind at the time.
Now, the point on which I require information is, have I got any sugges-
tion of the Blue Rock Thrush's song in the following piece, which I
am compelled to quote in full ? Because I not only have never heard
this song, but have not read any detailed description of it, and so
have had absolutely no idea of it in my mind to draw upon
unconsciously, as I may have done in the cases of the Skylark and
Missel Thrush. The piece runs as follows :--
" I am the bird the Psalmist knew,
That lone upon the house-top sings :
Though I flaunt not the vivid hue
That flashes from the halcyon's wings,
I bear the softer sweeter blue

But the home scenes of Britain view,
From Heroics' Gate to Khambalu
My rhyme o'er rocks and ruins rings."
If I have got this song right, there would seem to be some reason
for supposing that poets really have the insight they claim ; at any
rate the other instances I have given are curious coincidences. What I
should also like to know is, how many times a curious coincidence
has to happen before it becomes the subject of a legitimate scientific
inference ?

A WEAVER AND A WHYDAH
Two somewhat dubious Ploceid Finches in eclipse plumage on sale
in the Zoo department of Messrs. Gamage were pointed out to me by
the manager during the latter part of 1930. I decided to have these
sent on for developments, and in the spring of 1931 turned them out
in the garden aviaries. The Weaver proved to be Hyphantornis
mariquensis (see Ibis, 1868, pi. x, by L. Wolf), but the Whydah remained
a mystery by assuming an entirely black plumage and leaden silver
bill. On examination the lesser wing coverts only exhibited greenish
edges. On the assumption of the eclipse plumage the wing pattern
assumed the colours of V. eques (P.Z.S., 1863, pi. xv, by Lenneus),
but the rectrices were not long enough for that bird. It seems I shall
have to wait yet another season to decide whether it is not a form of
Penthetria albonotata, of which species I have had several examples.
Both birds seem only fit companions for H. cucullatus or P. oryx,
and much too offensive when enclosed with the smaller Fire Weaver
group, even capensis. A. Silver.
THE FOOT OF THE CASSOWARY

Our Cassowary has the three toes, but it is the inner toe which has
the long claw.
Is there any difference in Cassowaries in this respect ?
Anatomically, of course, it would be a big difference, so I imagine
it must be a slip.

ZEBRA FINCHES AND ORANGE WEAVERS
I thought my first year here was going to be a complete failure as
far as breeding results were concerned, as the only foreigners that
nested were a pair of Zebra Finches, and they spoilt their chance of
success by the cock being too fond of seeing what was going on while
it was his turn to sit. The eggs, all fertile, were laid far back in a Keston
Finch box. This did not suit Mr. Zebra and he carried up seven pieces
of lime about the size of a Zebra's egg, placed them well to the front
of the box, and I presume he sat on these as he was always very visible
when he took his turn at sitting. However, as I bought him on
1st April I could not expect much from him.
All my failures were forgotten when my Orange Weaver came into
colour, as he paid great attention to the hen and she showed every
sign of accepting him. He built a nest in a branch hanging on the wall
of my indoor aviary (a converted bedroom), and shortly after I saw
the hen take up a piece of flowering grass. He was overjoyed when she
did this and danced rather than flew about all day, " singing " his odd
" song "; when the hen had lined and completed the nest entirely
with feathery brown flowering grass-heads, they mated at the opening
of the nest. She would go there calling him to her. She laid one egg
only, a very glossy blue one with no spots. She sat so carelessly that
I was absolutely amazed to see a baby weaver about thirteen days
later. I was unprepared, but got dozens of spiders as soon as I could
and mashed them into " Stimulete ", and the baby lived three days,
and then I found the hen dragging it about the floor. The cock built

again two further nests and tried hard to persuade another hen to take
an interest in one, but she refused absolutely, and so he pulled feathers
out of her in a rage. His mate would not accept the new nests either,
but redecorated the old and laid three eggs, one in the nest, one on
my head as I was washing the floor, and one on the floor in her haste
to get out of the nest quickly for a mealworm. She again sat on the
one egg. This time I had gentles, and everything ready and the egg
was not fertile. After I took it away the cock drove the hen to sit for
three further days, sitting above the nest to keep her there. For a time
while she was sitting he became very vindictive to an odd Napoleon
Weaver hen I have. I bought both the Orange Weavers for 6 d. in
very bad condition on the 15th of March, and I kept the hen warm in
a small cage until May before she grew any feathers except her head
feathers and a few battered wing feathers. She grew no feathers
until I gave her Phospherine, and then she became covered in tiny
quills after taking it for a week.
One further point of interest about their nesting. After the egg
hatched the hen decorated the rim of the nest with much flowering
grass, completely hiding any view of the baby. It was quite a fairly
deep nest, and the hen used to hold on to the rim with her feet and lower
herself slowly down breast first. The cock has lost his orange now, but
he has not lost his passion for weaving, and there are many half
completed nests in the aviary.

This brilliant little bird--more brilliant perhaps than beautiful--
is a great rarity nowadays in aviculture. It is an inhabitant of the
warmer parts of Australia. Although discovered in 1839, it seems to
have been practically lost sight of until 1894, when the Horne Expedi-
tion came across it in Central Australia. Subsequently a few living
.specimens reached this country. Mr. Herbert Astley acquired a pair
in 1896, and specimens were exhibited at shows in London in 1908.
In 1910 Mr. F. E. Blaauw purchased a pair from the Antwerp Zoological
Cardens, which nested in a box in a warm sheltered outdoor aviary,
building a large, dome-shaped nest from the materials of two Common
Wrens' nests and one Robins'. Apparently nothing came of their
attempts. He describes these as " very quiet little birds, which in
many of their little ways remind me of the Red-shouldered Finch
from Africa (Pytelia phcenicoptera) ". (Avicultural Magazine,
1910, p. 289.) Mr. Reginald Phillipps, in our Magazine for 1911,
writes of his experience with the species and records the astonishing
fact that some sixty pairs of Painted Finches reached the Port of
London in February of that year !
Mr. Phillipps found them quite ready to go to nest, but although
he had three pairs only one young bird left the nest and this sub-
sequently died, and in spite of the number of birds imported at that
time, none seems to have been successfully reared from the nest, which
seems to show that our climate is unsuitable to their well-being and,

if others should be imported, it would be best to confine them to a
well-lighted indoor aviary. From Mr. Phillipps's experience it would
seem that small insects formed a considerable portion of the food
of the nestling.
As may be seen from the accompanying plate, the sexes are almost
alike when adult though the cock-bird has more red on the face and
throat than the hen. Our plate appears to be wrong in one respect,
namely in the colour of the eyes, which, in the adult birds, is white.

NOTES ON THE BIRDS AT LILFORD,
1930 AND 1931
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978544857142857" page_id="56221830"  page_num="46" year="" vol="">
By A. F. Moody
I am permitted by their owner to send a few particulars of the birds
at Lilford during seasons 1930 and 1931. These, of a brief and scrappy
nature, are very incomplete. Still, failing more important matter,
I trust the editor may find a corner for them.
In the first place, with much good money going to the nation's
need, aviculture, like other interests, has suffered. We endeavour,
therefore, to replace stock as much as possible by breeding or by
exchange.
The two comparatively mild, damp seasons have also been conducive
to losses by death ; certainly more so than the cold, dry winter of
1929-30. Our greatest loss, of course, as recorded in the January
(1931) number of this Magazine, was a female Whooping Crane (Grus
americana), a much lamented bird which valiantly strove to the very
last to live, and apparently succumbed to sheer old age.
Since then, three other Cranes, a Sarus, a Manchurian, and an
Asiatic White have died natural deaths. This quartet had lived
38, 42, 41, and 41 years respectively in the collection, making it
appear, supposing them to have been youthful when received, that
the natural lives of the larger Cranes may possibly be in the
neighbourhood of forty-five years.

A. F. Moody--Notes on the Birds at Lilford , 1930 and 1931 4 7
Another veteran showing age, and who now has his good and bad
days, is an Imperial Eagle ( Aquila mogilnih) received in 1895. Others
to join the great majority include a Short-tailed Glossy Starling,
15 years, a Great Crested Grebe, which thrived for a year with us,
and, of course, the usual crop of infants. Additions during the period
referred to include three pairs of New Zealand Grey Duck ( Anas
superciliosa) received direct from that country ; also four of their
Pukeko or Swamp Hens (Porphyrio melanonota). These, thanks to
the kindness of the people concerned and the very excellent manner
in which they were packed, reached this country in excellent condition,
as did later a beautiful pair of Yariegated Shelduck or Paradise Ducks
(Tadorna variegata) very kindly brought over and presented by the
late Mr. Reginald Loder.
Another interesting acquisition is a brood of six Red-breasted
Mergansers (M erg us senator) reared from wild-taken eggs.
This species, so far as I am aware, has rarely been reared in captivity.
Our examples, three pairs, one of which some time ago found a home
in the Zoo, were hatched on 10th July, 1930. From the first they
proved ready feeders, and without any unusual difficulty were reared
under a hen. Incubation lasted 29 days. The young began
to feather at about 16 days ; indications of a crest appearing at
about 5 weeks. The sexes could be distinguished as soon as feathered
or earlier by the females' smaller size. On handling two males at 20
weeks old, the small ornamental shoulder feathers were just visible.
Further notes are that by December all the birds had gained much
white on the throat, etc., while by January, 1931, the males retained
had acquired a considerable amount of colour, including some dark
on the sides of the head. Finally, at the time of writing (Christmas,
1931) the surviving male (one unfortunately during the past autumn
was choked by swallowing a wasp) is coming into full colour.
Other breeding successes of 1930 include most of the more usually
bred duck, Upland Geese, Scaup, Mellers Duck ( Anas melleri), one
Japanese White-necked Crane, and one Red-billed Tree Duck
(Dendrocygna autumnalis).
During 1931, most species of Duck were reared, our best lots being
nine Mellers Duck (Anas melleri ), two Comb Ducks or Indian Black

In spite of our best efforts to the contrary, several hybrid Ducks
were produced and reared, namely a full brood of nine Scaup X Canvas
Back, and a pair of Falcated X Shoveller.
During this season the Bing-necked Parrakeets flying at liberty
increased by five.
Three beautiful Bed and Blue Macaws at liberty did not nest for
some weeks, however, they took possession of, and jealously guarded,
a hole in an elm-tree.
A pair of Blue and Yellow Macaws [Am ararauna), confined to an
aviary, laid, and dutifully sat upon, a first and second clutch of infertile
eggs.
Two further additions have been a pair of Mexican Thrushes
(Turdus tristis), and a pair of South African Thrushes (Turdus
olivaceous). The former somewhat resembles our English Song Thrush
except that the sides and breast are uniform, the throat only being
pale and spotted ; said to be a songster of some merit, the only sound
I have heard proceed from the species is a sweet and rather Blue-bird-
like note.
The Africans differ in the sexes by the male being olivaceous above,
dull orange beneath. The female resembles a female Blackbird, and
in the distance might easily be mistaken for one.
Trumpeters of two species (Dusky and Grey-winged) have been
added, as have Lesser White-fronted Geese, the rarest, smallest, and
most attractive of the British Grey Geese.
Comparatively new arrivals also include a pair of Dusky Thrushes
(Turdus dubius), Black-billed Tree Duck, Boseate Spoonbill, Scarlet
Ibis, Great White Herons, Orinoco, Semi-palmated, and a pair of the
beautiful little Maned Geese (Chenonetta jubata) from Australia.
Beferring to this last-mentioned assortment, most are well known,
including the large Egrets. Before leaving the latter, however, I may
state they arrived in the spring, completely moulted out during the
summer, and although not allowed to fly, very ornamental they looked
wading about the shallows or perching upon the low trees of an island.

semi-liberty, was their cleverness and perseverance in stalking
Chaffinches. Usually they approached with stealthy steps, neck held
high, and eyes focussed upon the quarry. Sometimes a luckless victim
would be caught. More often patience went unrewarded.
On being transferred lately to a pool aviary, where they are shut
into a shed at night, this trio still retain their wealth of plumes 1 and
snow-white purity.
The Black-billed Tree Ducks (Dendrocygna arhorea) received from
a private source, are charming birds, extremely tame, and apparently
hardy enough to stay out of doors during any but the worst weather.
Equally pleasing are the dainty little Maned Geese, scarcely larger
than a Wigeon. These wander about, utter their peculiar barking cry,
and seem ever pleased to see one. The Orinocos too (Chenalopex
juhata) are attractive. Conspicuous amongst other waterfowl by
their foxy plumage, upright carriage, and bright red sealing-wax-like
legs, they appear to require some protection during their first winter
and are for the present being slept under cover with some half-hardy
Tree Ducks.
Should the weather become severe, the Magpie Geese (Anseranas
melanoleuca) also may be favoured in this way. These curious birds
indeed, are natives of Australia, and I understand of recent years
have rarely been imported. Our examples are remarkably tame ; they
follow one about like a dog, take food from the hand, and are very
conspicuous by their black and white plumage, long orange-yellow
legs, and partially webbed feet.
One other bird much admired by ornithologists visiting the collection
during the past two years is a female Montague's Harrier (Circus
cineraceus). Said to be a species difficult to maintain in perfect plumage
and condition in confinement, I have always as an ex-falconer, thought
that given the care and attention so necessary to the smaller and more
delicate Hawks, that the Harriers might prove more satisfactory ; the
result being, the example in question has responded to this treatment
and, although kept loose in an aviary, continues to be fairly steady,
sleek, and in faultless feather.

By P. B. Webb
In the late Autumn of 1930, I was lucky enough to get five newly-
imported Red-headed Parrot Finches all in the pink of condition.
Having heard that the number of cocks imported greatly exceeded
the hens, I thought it wise to buy six more which were offered to me
about a month later. When these six arrived, three were rather sick
looking, and though they bucked up a bit in a few days time, I eventually
lost all three during the winter. When they were opened, all three
proved to be cocks.
During the last week in June the remaining birds were turned out
by themselves into one of my aviaries, which was 12 by 16 feet,
and 7 feet high. It was planted with a hedge of box about 4
or 5 feet high, and one or two other bushes. There were several
Hartz cages, a few small nesting boxes of usual type, four coco-nut
husks, a rush nest, and two straw hats, these we placed in suitable
places both in the flight and the shed.
For two days the whole family enjoyed themselves chasing each
other, evidently delighted to be outside again. On the third day I found
a Hartz cage almost half-full of beech leaves, dried grass, and moss
when I inspected at lunch time. Next day the nest was complete as
far as I could see, and one of the birds sat looking out and chasing
his friends if they dared to come too close. I did not dare to go near
it, so I did not know for almost a week that no eggs were laid.
The nest had been abandoned at this time, and another one had
been started also in a Hartz cage. The first was situated about 18
inches from the ground in the box hedge, and was well concealed, but
the second was in the most conspicuous place possible, about 5 feet
from the ground against the wall of the house. It had absolutely not
a leaf within 4 feet of it. This nest was treated in the same way as
the first, and in four or five days I noticed that work had begun in a
straw hat. It was 6 feet from the ground and inside the house. Three
days of building and then at early morning roll I was a Parrot Finch
short. I did not see it for three days, so a search was made for it
everywhere, keeping away from the nest. No dead bird could be

found, high or low. The following day another search was made, also
without result. I was in such distress that I decided to look in the
nest. It also was empty. The hat was so full of hay and moss that
it was almost up to the hole, and this being fairly large, there was
no doubt it was empty either of eggs, bird, or anything else.
A few days later I counted the birds as usual in the morning, and
there was one too many. The next day the same. Another general
search was made for a nest which had not previously been found.
Now the secret was revealed--the nest in the straw hat had two decks,
and there were three young birds and a clear egg in it. When the
straw hat was removed from the wall the whole structure could be

seen as though in section. The top nest was full of droppings as though
the cock spent the night up there. Then there was a vertical passage
down the side of the hat into the real nest, which was almost at the
bottom.
Needless to say, the nest was replaced with great haste, and on
inspection about an hour later the birds were one short again, so my
mind became easy. It was not long before the very strange sounds
made by young Parrot Finches were heard when the shed was entered.
I have lost the notes I made of the day they left the nest, but one
morning when I was doing my round, it was very evident that some-
thing out of the ordinary was going on. Three youngsters were out

of the nest, and were flying about like feathered bullets, smashing
against the wire division in their house till the place was in a perfect
pandemonium.
Now, at this time the weather was very showery, and I spent a
week in fear and trembling that they would get out into the aviary
and get caught in the rain. Every time a shower came on I was to be
seen heading for the aviary and catching the young birds and replacing
them in the sheds.
The hole from the shed to the flight was reduced to 3 by 3
inches, but it was no good, in five minutes they were out again.
Perhaps I wasted my time, I do not know, but several times a shower
of rain has left young Zebra Finches dead in my aviary, and no chances
were being taken, in spite of the fact that Parrot Finches seemed to
me as hard as nails.
At the end of a week all was* well, and the youngsters had gained
enough knowledge of the world to know when and how to get out of
harm's way.
Perhaps I should mention that the young birds were rather a
dirty green colour, lighter underneath, with black upper mandible
and yellow under. Their tails were short and almost black, very little
red to be seen at first. One bird was quite red-headed, while the other
two had only about six red feathers each. I wonder, will they turn
out to be hens ?
All had the curious blobs on the sides of their bills, a large one
and a small on each side. Even the small ones are larger than those
found on young Gouldians.
Their legs were very dark yellowish grey, but paler than the
adult bird.
My old birds were fed during the winter on canary seed, white
and spray millet, and about two mealworms per head once a week.
They seemed to do well, and were in perfect feather, except when in
the moult. They are fond of spray millet and canary, but took very
little white millet. They were offered " paddy " rice and though they
consumed a little they seemed to throw 90 per cent of it about, so I
gave it up. I don't like this seed anyway, so it was a relief to me that
they were not strong on it either. They also had before them from
the time they were turned out, a small dish of insectivorous food, which

is supplied for my Shamas. They were on the look-out for this
every morning, though they only ate small quantities of it. I have
found the same treatment very suitable for the blue-headed variety
(trichroa).
The first nestlings were flying about two weeks when the second
nest was started. Again a straw hat was used, it was also in the shed,
but was only about 18 inches from the ground. It also had two stories,
but something went wrong, and though it had very definitely
a basement, the ceiling gave way a bit, so it was apparently decided to
use only the floor above, and in this three more white eggs were laid.
I discovered this when inspecting the nest on the tenth day of incuba-
tion. This is where the big blunder happened. Entering the shed on
this morning the bird left the nest.
Thinking this a good chance to have a peep inside, I closed the
entrance to the flight, so that I could do the job unobserved by the old
birds. The eggs were there, and I was satisfied. About two hours later
it suddenly struck me that I had not reopened the slide to the flight.
I hurried home, only to find that this was correct. The birds returned
to the nest, and in due course one young bird hatched, it lived three
days, and the old birds had stopped brooding it.
Next morning the birds had started sitting on the two unhatched
eggs again, I let them sit for two more days just to make sure that this
was really so.
On removing the eggs, both had birds in them, but, of course, dead.
I paid dearly for my forgetfulness, but is it usual for birds to start
sitting again like this ?
At this time the old birds were well in the moult, and therefore
the nesting hats, etc. were removed for the season.
Perhaps of the many things learned about these birds, the most
interesting are as follows :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.944835857142857" page_id="56221837"  page_num="53" year="" vol="">
(1) That out of eleven old birds imported, only one turned out to
be a hen.
(2) That though there were several odd cocks in the aviary, they
gave no trouble at all during the breeding season.
(3) Mr. Seth-Smith is right, they do like straw hats.

the birds don't mind you being " nosey " you may make a slip.

P. B. Webb--Parrot Finches
The young birds are now--24th December--exactly like the adults,
and all are full of the joy of life. They are, of course, all indoors in
their shed with about ten small Waxbills. The house is heated--
but don't let this worry any of you--the temperature never goes above
55* F., but I don't like it to go below 50* F., though it has been
down to 42* F. on one very cold night, without doing any harm.
It is easy to keep a small room up to this heat, so don't look upon
it as out of your reach if you have not tried it. If you have electric
power, try this way : Get (second-hand, if possible) an ordinary water
radiator and an electric immersion heater (this must be new)--your
plumber will fix it into the radiator for you. You only need a small
heater, say 750 watts. The General Electric Co. supply one of this
power with three heats which is very suitable, but a single heat one
will do quite well, in which case probably 500 watts would be the best
size for a room about 12 by 12 feet.
You could use an ordinary electric fire, but it is inclined to dry
the air up so I like the water best.
I have decided to keep my three young birds in the hope of having
two or three true pairs for next year.
I think that no one wdio has kept and bred Red-headed Parrot
Finches would put any other foreign Finch before them, perhaps there
are few who would put any bird before them. However, with my
limited experience I should not say this, but if anyone can tell me of
any better, please do so ; I would like to have a pair in time for next
season.
Now, just one more thing, if I may. I believe that an expert can
sex these birds fairly accurately, given several to choose from. The
true pair I have are as like each other as two peas, as are all the adult
birds I have ; so unless you don&apos;t mind chancing being wrong, don't
choose a pair of birds that show an apparent sex difference, if you do,
sure as a gun, in a month or so when the dull-coloured one has moulted,
you won't know one from the other.
I hope these notes will be of use to some of our members who
may possess at some time a pair of these most delightful birds.
N.B.--One of the young birds is a hen, at any rate (25th January,
1932).

Continuing the notes on the various rare Pittas which appeared in
the last August issue of the Magazine, I might mention that quite a
few of the beautiful Blue-tailed Pittas ( Eucichla cyanura) were imported
last autumn by Mr. Frost, and I hope by now that these birds have
found a home where they will receive the attention that they deserve.
Most of the birds were males, which rather bears out the statement
by Whitehead that the males and females separate at certain seasons
of the year.
In colour this bird has the top of the head black, the feathers forming
a pointed crest falling over the nape. Below this is a broad band of
brilliant golden yellow, while below this from the beak to the back
of the neck is another band of black feathers. The chin and throat
are white, passing into another band of golden yellow, which meets at
the back of the neck. On the upper breast is a band of brilliant shining
blue, below which the whole breast is golden yellow finely barred
with shining blue. Seen in the sunlight, the whole breast has a wonderful
blue lustre. The upper parts are a rich reddish brown, the wings black,
the wing-coverts and secondaries tipped with white, the narrow pointed
tail bright shining blue. The beak is black and the legs leaden colour.
In the nesting habits this bird differs from the rest in so much that
it does not nest upon the ground as the others do, and we read in the
" Pittidea" that "the nest is built six or eight feet above the ground, and
is usually placed amid the branches of an orchideous bush growing as
a parasite upon some old trunk. These plants are frequently damp
and mouldy, and occasionally the nest becomes soaked through from
beneath." We are also told that " when seeking food, this bird will
sometimes scratch with its feet in the manner of a chicken, and examine
the scattered leaves and exposed ground with the bill. Its foods consists
of earthworms, beetles, and various insects and their larvae."
The Borean Granatine Pitta ( Pitta granatina borneensis). This
amazingly coloured bird is perhaps the loveliest of the whole family,
and perhaps one of the most extraordinary birds in the world. It
seems as though Nature had done her utmost in brilliant decoration

with, the Pittas, vieing one with another. This bird is very rotund
in shape, looking almost like a brilliantly coloured ball on long legs.
Nothing is known of the wild life of this bird except that it is found in
swampy old jungles close to the sea in the great island of Borneo,
where so many other extraordinary feathered forms are found. My
bird was brought over by Mr. Goodfellow with four or five others in
November of 1930. This is the second time that this bird has been
imported, one other coming over in 1928, and was in Mr. Spedan Lewis'
collection. My bird, a female, reared two young ones which were put
in the same cage with it but as soon as they were able to fend for
themselves she killed them by " braining " them. This, no doubt,
shows that Pittas drive away their young as soon as they can fend for
themselves.
Mr. Goodfellow tells me that the way the natives catch the birds
is to find out the nest of the species, which is similar to that of a Wren's,
made of moss with the hole at the side, and placed on the ground at the
foot of a tree. The natives watch from a distance for the birds to
enter the nest. They then creep up from behind the tree, and at an
opportune moment clap their hands over the hole of the nest. After
having caught one bird, they wait for the other, thus capturing both
male and female. This shows, no doubt, that both male and female
incubate.
The bird may be described as follows : The front of the head and
crown to a line behind the eye, deep crimson, almost black ; a large
circular patch on the back of the crown, nape, and neck, a brilliant
crimson ; on each side of the head above the eyes is a long fine line of
silvery lilac-blue feathers which stand out in the form of two horns.
The whole back and wings are a glossy reddish purple, each feather
having a lighter centre. The whole of the wing-coverts is a bright
silvery lilac blue. The throat and upper breast are a rich deep purplish
crimson, the whole of the underparts being the most brilliant scarlet.
The tiny tail is bright purplish blue. The legs and beak are black.
The horns with which this bird is adorned are quite unique, and are
possessed by no other bird.
I found this Pitta different in its general demeanour from any other
Pitta. Though tame, it was not very intelligent. It had a very peculiar

habit of appearing to waltz round and round very quickly ; it also
threw all its food out of the pot as soon as it was put in the aviary,
and then picked it up at its leisure. This, I think, caused its death,
as it picked up some dirt which caused mycosis. It never bathed,
but stood for long periods in the water. It was really one of the dirtiest
birds I have ever kept, but I was very sorry to lose it, for besides
being one of the most unique birds I have ever had, I may never get
the chance of ever getting another of these strange creatures. I think
this bird must have been caught in a snare, for there were two deep
wounds on its knees, but these were not noticeable unless the bird
was handled.
Muller's Pitta {Pitta mulleri). This bird is a sub-species of the Black-
headed Pitta (Pitta sordida), and these two birds have at various times
been classed as the same species. Up to now I do not think that any
one has had the chance of comparing living birds of the two species
together before, for the only example of P. mulleri brought to this
country was purchased by me from Mr. Goodfellow in the autumn
of 1930. When I first saw it, it struck me as being very much larger
and brighter in colour than my example of P. sordida, and comparing
the two birds together, the difference was very apparent.
Dried skins, shrunk and faded, would give little idea of the great
difference between the two birds. This bird is confined to Borneo, on
which island are found so many others of this beautiful group.
This Pitta came to me in a very poor condition, with its feet swollen
almost to the size of small marbles, indeed so swollen were they that
the bird was only able to hobble about on its tarsi. It was almost
dead through lack of food, and cold after a long and delayed journey
from London on a bitter winter's day. We placed it in a cage with
a thick layer of leaf-mould over a radiator, so that it could rest more
comfortable, but in spite of everything we did it died in a few days,
a loss which I much regretted.
Baud's Pitta ( Pitta haudi). This is one of the loveliest and the
rarest of the whole family. It is an amazingly coloured bird. Elliott
says in his monograph: " This species in the vividness and depth of
its strongly contrasted colours must be regarded as the most striking
and beautiful of the Pittidse."

A few of these wonderful creatures were brought back by Mr. Good-
fellow from Sarawak in November, 1930. One was in full colour, but
the others were in the sombre plumage of the females or young males,
for in this species, contrary to the usual rule, the female is dull coloured.
I did not purchase any at the time, as I was moving house, and did
not want too many birds. This I much regretted, for a little later on,
when I wanted one, they were all sold. All the birds seemed to be very
tame. I think the Zoo has one of them, but this is a female, a rather
inconspicuous bird of a dull chestnut and fawn with a bright blue tail.
Since the following notes were written, two very fine Pittas have
been imported for the first time by Mr. Frost, namely, the Giant
Pitta ( Pitta mixima) from Halmaheira, a wonderful creature, of which
the dried skins in museums give no idea of the real beauty of the
live bird. The white feathers of the breast resemble the whitest
porcelain, and the under parts are the most wonderful " living "
wine-red.
It is thought that the white breast of this bird has been evolved
as a protective measure, as there is an immense outcrop of white
limestone in the forests which it inhabits, and as the great naturalist,
Wallace, says, " it is everywhere projecting and often almost blocking
up the pathways."
Macklot's Pitta (Pitta mackloti) is a much smaller bird than the
foregoing, and is characterized by having the breast with bands of
black, blue, and vivid scarlet, and belongs to the group known as the
Red-breasted Pittas, of which most examples are found in the islands
adjacent to New Guinea.
This bird has a wide distribution being found on the mainland of
New Guinea, also on many of the neighbouring islands, and in the Cape
York district of Northern Australia.
Both the Noisy Pitta ( Pitta strepitans), a bird which bears
a resemblance to the Green-breasted Pitta but lacks the green breast,
and the Rainbow Pitta ( Pitta iris), a most lovely bird, which is-
characterized by having the head and breast jet black, have both been
imported, the two species being found in Northern Australia.
Swinhoe's Pitta ( Pitta oreas), a beautiful bird allied to the well-
known Bengal Pitta which is found in a certain part of eastern China,.

and again in Formosa, was imported a few years ago for a well-known
aviculturist.
Another beautiful Pitta which has been imported several times, is
the Blue-winged Pitta (Pitta molaccensis), a bird with a very wide
distribution, being found in Burma, Siam, the Malay Peninsula,
Sumatra, Borneo, south China, and the Philippines.
In conclusion, I might also mention the New Guinea Pitta ( Pitta
atricapilla), a bird belonging to the green-breasted group, and I believe
there are one or two examples at the present moment in the Zoological
Society's gardens. This, I think, is a complete list of all the species
which from time to time have been imported into this country. Making
a total of sixteen out of the fifty known species.

By Dr. W. Hamilton (South Australia)
In August, 1929, spring and nesting time in South Australia, I took
ten days holiday, and made a quick dash to the west coast. A thirty-
six hours journey by steamer and rail.
Arrived at 5 a.m. at a small bush railway siding, where I was
met by a patient of mine, who drove me 8 miles to his house,
which I made my headquarters for the next ten days.
I had personally made six new trapping cages--being optimistic--
and with a new pair of nets 24 feet long and a Neophema
elegans as a call bird, I felt that the Scarlet-chested Parrot (Neophema
splendida ) was going to be unlucky enough to be caught. The day
after my arrival we drove to the mission station, and tried to get
some information about the Parrot. Humours were numerous, and
we drove from farm to farm, asking if any had been seen, but without
having any luck.
The Aboriginals suggested trying a spring some miles inland from
the mission station, and well into the desert. This spring had been
known from time immemorial, and surely would be a likely place for
birds to drink, especially as it was the only water for miles around
that had been there before the white man came.

Full of hope, we set out, and found the spring--a beautiful shallow
basin of water in a granite rock. The comparative absence of droppings
was rather a disquieting feature. However, we set the nets, cut down
a few boughs of mallee scrub, and slept on the ground.
Up at sunrise--about 4 a.m.--to my hide, only to see in the next
three hours two Major Mitchell Cockatoos and a few Cat Birds.
This little disappointment was typical of what happened in the
next week. Suffice it to say that we covered many miles, north, south,
east, and west, on rumours of the birds having been seen by someone.
Port Lincoln Bingnecks 1 and Many-colours were the only Parrots
seen, and they were regarded as a pest by the farmers, as they ate
the grain, and even attacked the wheat bags to get at the contents.
As the time for my departure drew near, I decided that I might as
well catch some birds of some sort to take back--not relishing the idea
of returning empty-handed.
So the morning of my return I went to a farm, set the nets, and
caught three dozen Bingnecks and five dozen Many-colours.
Actually I caught more than that number of Many-colours, but
was amazed to see that a great number were suffering from eye
disease. I had not known, prior to this, that it could occur in their
natural state, but just accepted the general view that it was contracted
in dirty trapping cages, etc.
All affected birds I released, and only kept those that seemed free
from any sign of the disease.
These were put in my nice new clean cages, which had an inner
lining of soft netting to prevent injury. In thirty-six hours I was back
in Adelaide, and when I looked at my Many-colours, quite 50 per cent
of them had eye disease.
I put two pairs in a small cage, about 12 by 15 by 18 inches, and
kept them there until one pair had the disease very badly with bulging
eye and abscess formation.
The other pair were not so far advanced. I treated all the birds
with one drop three times a day of 25 per cent Argyrol and 1 per cent
Atropine, placed on each eye.

The badly affected pair improved, and the eye, though blind, sank
back a little, but these two birds died.
The other pair, not so far advanced, completely recovered. I left
them in this infected cage for three months without further treatment,
and they showed no tendency to relapse.
Ultimately I presented them to a sea captain, who took them to
England, and they have shown no sign of reinfection.
My cages were absolutely new, and were only completed in time
for my trip. They had never had a bird in them, so the infection could
not have come from the cages.
Evidently the birds that I had kept as being free from eye disease,
must have been already infected, though so slightly as not to be
noticeable. The jostling in the cages, and the fright which would
make them dash about, would naturally injure them, and cause the
eye condition to progress rapidly.
One possible explanation occurs to me. For two or three years
prior to this there had been a drought on the west coast, which is a
farming district, and sparsely settled. The country is sandy, and
winds were almost of daily occurrence. Farmers would sow their
crops time after time, watch them sprout and show above the ground,
perhaps 2 or 3 inches. Then came the sand storm, and the
crops were cut off, shrivelled up, and buried with sand. Heartbreaking
for the poor farmers, some of whom sowed their crops five and six
times, and reaped nothing.
It is possible that the constant dust and sand storms with their
flying particles of grit, may have irritated the eyes of the Parrots until
they developed this eye disease. I have no proof, however, and merely
offer it as a suggestion.
I think that early cases of eye disease may be checked, and even
cured in Parrots the size of Many-colours, and the larger ones such as
Barrabands and Bock Peplars (which, by the way, are called Bock
Pebblers with us). But I do not think there is much--if any--chance
of curing the smaller Grass Parrots of the Neophema species.
Soon after my return from the west coast, a patient who lives at
Keith, in the south-east of South Australia (not a great way from
where the Orange-breasted Grass Parrots have been seen), sent me a

young Porphyry Crowned Lorikeet, which was unable to fly when its
parents and brother (or sister) left the nest. I noticed that it had no
flight or tail feathers, and resembled in appearance the Budgerigars
that most of us have been unlucky enough to breed sometimes, with
what is known as " French moult".
I kept the bird in a small cage, and fed him on bread and milk and
sugar (Dr. Allinson's food being unobtainable in Australia), and he
thrived amazingly, but has never grown tail or flight feathers.
He was kept hanging under the grape vines close to my talking
Amazon--the only two birds I have in small cages.
The Amazon's cage is 5 feet long, 4 feet high, and 3 feet wide,,
so he can move about and get some exercise.
I never knew that these small Lorikeets could talk, but this one
has picked up a few words from the Amazon, and says : " Hello boy,"&apos;
" Hello cocky boy," and " How are you," in a very gruff voice, but
clearly enough to be understood.
As he seemed lonely, I put a hen of the same species in with him..
She was always getting out of her aviary somehow, and I never
discovered how she got out. The daily catching of her became a.
nuisance, so I put her in with the lonely one as a punishment. Ho
bosses her around, and makes amazing noises that are not Lorikeet
sounds.
I had heard that French moult does occur in the natural state, but
this is my first personal experience of it.
The bird is 2-|- years old, now, so I can see no reason to-
hope that he will ever grow feathers. He was very tame, and I used
to carry him round perched on my finger, and show him all the other
Parrots.
[A remarkable case of what appears to have been the condition known as;
" French moult " occurred in wild Red-rumped Parrakeets in the Adelaide district
some forty-five years ago, as recorded by Mr. Edwin Ashby, as follows, in The, Emu
for April, 1907, and referred to in this Magazine in June of that year. " In the-
neighbourhood of the Adelaide Hills the Red-rumped Grass Parrakeet ( Psephotus \0x25A0
hcematonotus) was up till the years 1887-8, one of the commonest representatives-
of the family Psittcicidce. One of the early settlers in the Mount Barker district*
who settled there in 1839, says that they were most numerous in that neighbour-
hood until the years named. I can endorse this as regards the years 1885 and!
1886, when I first visited the Colony. In the years 1887-8, a disease* if such ifc

their feathers again. I caught a number of them, and they appeared to be quite
healthy, except being destitute of feathers. I conclude that the practical
extermination of this species, as far as the Adelaide Hills were concerned, was
due to their falling an easy prey to predaceous animals. So complete was the

By W. L. English, M.B.
I trust that no one will be disappointed. The title might suggest
that something is known about birds and vitamins, but one searches
the literature and finds only a few references. In Miss Browning's
monograph, The Vitamins, the word bird does not appear in the index.
There is something still to be learnt in this respect. The classical
experiments on polished rice and polyneuritis in Pigeons are mentioned.
Some time ago a lady remarked : 4 4 Doctor, I will never see you
again without being reminded of a monkey." This was not a reference
to my habits or appearance, at least, I think not, but to the fact that
I keep forty to fifty of the more delicate monkeys under observation.
A knowledge of vitamins is necessary, else the monkeys surely die.
It is illegal to try any experiment in feeding, in which any living thing
is deprived of something necessary to its comfort. It is not illegal, as
we do here, to bring dying marmosets and monkeys back to life, using
the skill and knowledge which we possess. It is miraculous to see a
dying marmoset improve under violet-ray and vitamin treatment. The
cure is certain. The complaint is rickets.
Marmosets, especially the Pigmy variety, always remind me of
birds, hence this article to stimulate the interest of aviculturists in
the subject.
What are vitamins ? Vitamins represent the pounds, shillings, and
pence of existence. We cannot live on money, but in a complex
civilization we cannot live without, even in the midst of apparent plenty.
Similarly a complex organism such as a bird or animal cannot live
even in the midst of apparent plenty without these accessories to food.
Vitamins can only so far be recognized by their absence. We can
tell that something is absent in certain dietaries, since the animal

or bird suffers in health. The addition of the appropriate vitamin
restores the sufferer.
I suggest an instance of vitamin-activity of interest to aviculturists.
Lime salts with vitamin D are necessary to a bird's existence.
Lime salts (calcium) are necessary for the general mechanism, for
heart-beats, bone-growth, and feather-growth, for the requirements of
the growing embryo, and for the formation of egg-shell. Now, it is a
well-known fact that birds whose young are hatched in a developed
condition have thick egg-shells, while birds whose young are hatched
undeveloped have thin egg-shells. Necessarily, birds which must fend
for themselves on hatching have sturdy legs, feathers, beak, etc. The
growing embryo absorbs lime from the shell during incubation, to form
bones, feathers, and beak, the shell gets more fragile, the bird breaks
through and runs oh.
In the nest, with naked and helpless young, lime salts are supplied
by the parents with food, after hatching. It was thought that the thick
shell was a protection, and it is ; it is a protection against a shortage
of lime salts, which means rickety, undeveloped young.
Science means knowledge. It is a scientific or known fact that this
process only takes place in the presence of vitamin D. The embryo
obtains this necessary vitamin D from the mother bird.
Apply this knowledge to " soft eggs The mother bird needs
vitamin D and lime salts for her own use ; if she is short of either
the embryo must go short and the embryo lacks the hard shell necessary
for its existence.
Vitamin D is necessary for the assimilation of calcium, and all the
lime salts in the world, whether in oats or anything else, will not prevent
harm to the organism if vitamin D be absent.
Rickets is a defective calcium metabolism, caused by the absence
of vitamin D. But, and it is a big but for Aviculturists, birds and
animals can manufacture their own vitamin D in their skin-coverings
of hairs or feathers under the influence of sunlight or the ultra-
violet ray.
Vitamin D and Tuberculosis
Generally nature's method of protection against the bacillus is to
enclose the diseased area in a calcareous mass of lime salts. During

the moult and when breeding, when calcium metabolism is at its
highest, this calcareous protection, if vitamin D and calcium are not
balanced, may be withdrawn and the disease progresses unfavourably.
This explains perhaps the harmful effect of too much sunlight on certain
birds. Too much sunlight or ultra-violet ray may actually precipitate
a fatal attack. I blame the rapid dissolution of a Dusky Parrot to my
misguided efforts with a mercury-vapour lamp. Post mortem examina-
tion showed this bird was tuberculous.
From theoretical conclusions I should predict that there is some
relation of vitamin D to " suppressed moult " in birds.

<bodyText confidence="0.950650272727273" page_id="56221849"  page_num="65" year="" vol="">
The problem of rickets is complicated by the fact that certain
grains, notably oats, contain a rachito-genic principle. A diet of oats
can actually cause rickets, which makes one wonder why a prominent
aviculturist actually recommends oats for Parrot-like birds. Rats
develop rickets when fed on an exclusive diet of oats, or yellow peas,
or wheat, or rye.
Sterility
Pigeons are sterile with a vitamin B deficiency, and probably in
a vitamin A deficiency.
Absence of vitamin E causes re-absorption of the embryo after
impregnation has taken place.
Occurrence of Vitamins
Generally vitamins occur in the most actively growing tissues of
plants, formed under the influence of sunlight.
Young lettuce and cabbage-leaves contain all the vitamins.
Lettuce is especially rich in the anti-sterility vitamin E. In a wild
state birds live on growing shoots and buds, or on some insect or bird
or animal which lives on these things. Vitamin D can be formed in
its feathers by light. The vitamin problem is complicated by the
individual animal or bird. A prominent authority has said to me :
" It is not so much a question of giving a balanced diet as of giving
the animal something which it will eat." Further, one must not expect

immediate results from replacing a vitamin deficiency. There is
invariably a latent period of three weeks.
During this latent period the animal or bird may die although
amply supplied. In birds this improvement might be deferred to the
next moult.
It is probable that birds can manufacture the other vitamins in
their skin, as well as vitamin D.
Clear eggs are due to a vitamin A or vitamin B deficiency, mostly,
or vitamin E.
The whole subject bristles with difficulties, like the Echidna at the
Zoo which should lay eggs; it overwhelms one. We do not lose any
marmosets now. I wish I could say the same of our birds.
Can we improve the health of delicate Softbills by feeding meal-
worms on vitamin-rich substances ? The experiment might be tried
with dried lettuce and cabbage-leaves, yeast, carrot, and cod-liver
oil mixed with meal.

FOREIGN BIRDS AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998758772727273" page_id="56221850"  page_num="66" year="" vol="">
The annual exhibition of Cage Birds was this year held at the Crystal
Palace from 4th to 6th February, and was conducted by the officials of the
Palace. Mr. S. A. Legg acted as secretary and show manager, and is to be
heartily congratulated on the success of the undertaking. The Foreign Bird
Section was staged in the large dining-hall, a most happy arrangement, as
the heating and lighting were both excellent. Numerically, the show was
not quite up to last year, though in quality it left nothing to be desired.
The Parrot classes suffered from the continuance of the regulations
prohibiting the importation of these birds, which might safely now be
cancelled or modified.
In the class for Lories, Lorikeets, and Hanging Parrots, Miss Home
secured first prize with a beautiful pair of Worcester's Hanging Parrots,
Mr. A. Wilson taking second with a good Purple-capped Lory.
In the Lovebird and Parrotlet class, Mr. Whitley obtained first place
with a pair of Green Parrotlets (Forpus viridissimus) which, I understand,
bred successfully last summer. Mr. Whitley's pair of Abyssinian Lovebirds
were second, a very good Red-faced shown by Mr. Frostick third, and a
pair of Fischers, belonging to Mr. Rigby, fourth.
Amongst the Commoner Parrakeets, Mr. Whitley won first with a Rosella,
and Mrs. Beauchamp second with a Tui; while in the Conures, Mr. Whitley
showed a very fine Wagler's Conure, a Patagonian, and a Red-headed which
obtained first, second, and third respectively. Mr. Whitley also took the

first three prizes in the class for Kings, Crimson-wings, Broadtails, and
Rock-peplars, with pairs of Kings, Crimson-wings, and a Yellow-collared,
Captain Liddell-Grainger obtaining fourth with a good pair of Rock-peplars.
In the " All Other Species " class, Mr. Whitley again captured all the
prizes with a fine team consisting of his splendid old cock Queen Alexandra,
a beautiful Red-shining, a Malaccan hen, and a Pileated or Red-capped, while
Mr. R. N. Knight showed a very nice Prince Lucien Conure, Mr. C. T. Maxwell
a pair of Browns, and Captain Liddell-Grainger a Blue Bonnet.
In the class for the Short-tailed Parrots, curiously enough there was
not a single Grey. Mr. Whitley was again to the fore with, first a fine Salvin's
Amazon, second a very fine Spectacled Amazon, and fourth, a Yellow-naped,
Mr. Maxwell coming third with a charming pair of Meyer's.
Then came the White Cockatoos, amongst which the three sent by
Mr. Whitley, a Philippine Red-vented (K. hcematuropygia), a White-crested
(K. alba), and a Lesser Sulphur-crest, obtained the first three places in the
order named.
The next class was for " All other Species of Cockatoos and Macaws ",
and it contained five entries, which were placed as follows :--First, a Palm
Cockatoo (Whitley); second, ditto (Maxwell) ; third, Lear's Macaw (Whitley);
fourth, Banksian (Whitley) ; and v.h.c., Spix Macaw (Maxwell).
The class for " All other Species of Parrots " contained ten entries.
Mr. Whitley again took first, second, and third prizes with a Red-capped, pair
of Duskey, and a pair of Blue-rumped Parrots ( Psittinus incertus ). Mr. Maxwell
took fourth with a nice Riippell's. Mr. Whitley also sent a good Aubrey's,
and Mr. L. A. Wilkins a good pair of Hawk-headed Parrots.
Then came the class for Hybrids and abnormally coloured Birds,
and in this Mr. Whitley's cinnamon coloured Piping Crow, a lovely specimen,
took first prize, his hybrid Crimson-wing X Rock-peplar second, and third,
his most interesting hybrid Rose-breasted and Lesser Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo, a striking bird of a silver-grey colour with rusty patches on its
cheeks, rusty-yellow tinge over breast and on the throat and collar, and
yellow under the wings. The fourth prize went to Mr. H. T. King for a pair
of Bengalese X Silverbills.
A pair of Blue Masked Lovebirds, bred in the Zoological Gardens, were
exhibited here, but not for competition.
The next class was for Quails, Rails, Pheasants, Partridges, Doves,
Ducks, and Waders. There were no Ducks or Pheasants, but Mr. Whitley
sent a fine Black-headed Partridge ( Alectoris melanocephala) which took first
prize, a Black Rail third, and a Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Pigeon fourth,
while Mr. G. Beever took second with a Scallop-necked Pigeon {C. speciosa ).
There were two pairs of Chinese Painted Quails.
There was a class for Zebra-finches with ten entries, while the Waybills
and Mannikins wers strongly represented in three classes, but call for no
comment.
There were sixteen entries in the class for the Australian Finches and
Quail Finches, the most interesting perhaps being Bicheno's and Ringed
Finches, the former with the white rump and the latter with black, both
forms being represented. It was also interesting to compare the two forms
of the Long-tailed Grassfinch, the Yellow-billed (P. acuticauda ) and the
Red-billed (P. a . hecki). Captain Liddell-Grainger took first prize with a
pair of Ringed Finches, Mr. Whitley second with Cherry Finches, and third

with Heck's Long-tails, while Mr. John Frostick's nice pair of Diamond
Finches came fourth.
There were seven entries in the class for Gouldian Finches, a brilliant
array, while the next class was for the Rarer Grassfinches, Waxbills, and
Others not previously mentioned and contained twenty entries. Mr. Whitley
came first and second with a Peale's Parrot Finch and pair of Rufous-tailed
Waxbills, Mr. J. Walsh's Violet-eared Waxbill coming third, and a Black-
cheeked Waxbill shown by Mr. Abdel Khalek fourth. Mr. Crama's Dufresne's
Waxbills obtained v.h.c., Mr. Beauchamp's Violet-ears h.c., and a wonderful
pair of Pintail Nonpareils sent by Mrs. Goddard only c. I think these last
should have been nearer the top.
The next class was for Buntings, Red-crested and Pileated Finches,
Seed-eaters, Sporophila, and others. It was a fine class of twenty-five entries,
but one bird, catalogued as a Bunting, was one of the Seed-eating Tanagers
( Buarremon ). Mr. P. W. Beauchamp took first prize with a Golden-breasted
Bunting, the second going to Dr. Macklin's Red-crested Finches, third to
Mr. Beauchamp's Junco, and fourth to Mr. Frostick's Rainbow Bunting.
Mr. J. R. Nicholson obtained v.h.c. with a nice Lazuli Bunting.
The class for Cardinals and Grosbeaks contained twenty-one entries,
first and second going to Captain Liddell-Grainger for his beautiful pairs of
the rare Black-throated and Black-cheeked Cardinals. Third prize went
to Mr. Beauchamp for a pair of large Blue Grosbeaks, and fourth to Mr. Whitley
for a Small Blue Grosbeak.
There was nothing startling in the class for Weavers and Whydahs,
but much of interest in the section for Softbills which followed. The first
three classes in this section were for Tanagers and Sugar Birds. The first
of these for Blue, Scarlet, Maroon, Archbishop, Superb, Tricolor, and
a few others. Mr. Maxwell took first with a very fine Superb, Mr. Whitley
second with an Archbishop, Mr. Allison third with another Superb, and
Mr. Lawrie fourth with a Tricolor.
In the class for All other Tanagers (not exceeding a Superb), Sugar
birds, Quits, and Zosterops, Mr. Maxwell secured first prize with a
beautiful Purple Sugarbird, Captain Liddell-Grainger second with a rare
Tanager (Tanagrella ?), third with another Purple, and fourth with a Spotted
Emerald Tanager. This was a splendid class with nineteen entries. The
class for All others larger than a Superb contained only five entries.
First a rare Red and Black Tanager belonging to Mr. Maxwell, who also
took second with a fine Magpie Tanager. Third prize went to Mr. L. A.
Wilkins, for an Olive and Blue and fourth to Mr. Whitley for Black-
throated Saltator.
In the Sunbird Class there was only one entry, a fine Scarlet-breasted
shown by Mr. Maxwell.
The Robin Class contained twelve entries, all Pekins and Blues, and
that for Shamas, Dhyals, and Mocking Birds, eight entries, the first prize
going to a fine pair of Mocking Birds shown by Mr. Whitley.
In the Glossy Starling Class, Mr. Whitley obtained first, second, and
fourth prizes with a fine Crowned Starling, a Long-tailed Glossy, and a
Burchell's respectively, Mr. Maxwell receiving third prize with a beautiful
pair of Royal Starlings.
The class for Mynahs and Starlings (other than Glossy), Thrushes,
Babblers, etc., contained fourteen entries. Mr. Whitley obtained first,

third, a Temminck's Whistling Thrush, and fourth, a Finch-billed Bulbul.
Mr. Webster obtained the second prize with a Hardwick's Fruit-sucker.
In the Hangnest class, Mr. L. H. Sutton secured first prize with a Yellow-
crowned Hangnest. There were seven entries. Mr. H. E. Gardner took second,
and Mr. Whitley third and fourth prizes, but unfortunately my notes fail me
here as to the species shown.
The class for Crows, Piping Crows, Jays, Barbets, and Motmots
contained six entries, the first prize going to Mr. Whitley for a good Motmot,
Mr. L. A. Wilkins taking second with a fine Swainson's Jay, third going to
a Golden-fronted Barbet belonging to Mr. Maxwell, and fourth to a Blue-
cheeked Barbet sent by Captain Liddell-Grainger.
Class 297 contained five entries, all Birds of Paradise. Mr. Whitley
sent a wonderful trio consisting of a Rothschild's, Wallace's, and a New
Guinea Rifle-bird--awarded the first three prizes, while Mr. C. T. Maxwell
took fourth and v.h.c. with a lovely Lesser Bird and a Wilson's.
The class for Toucans, Bower Birds, Bell Birds, etc., contained
seven entries, the first and second prizes going to two Toco Toucans belonging
to Messrs. Whitley and Maxwell. Third to Mr. Whitley for a Naked-throated
Bell Bird, and fourth to Mr. F. Hopkins for an Ariel Toucan.
The last class was for All Other Species, the most noteworthy exhibits
being two entries of Pittas beautifully shown in large cages, each with a
carpet of saxifrage. They were a Malaccan Pitta and a pair of Blue-tailed
Pittas shown by Mr. Whitley, and they secured the two premier prizes.
Mr. Maxwell took third with his lovely Mexican Woodpecker, and fourth
with a Fairy Blue Bird. Mr. Whitley was awarded v.h.c. for a Coucal.

It is really rather a tragedy that it is becoming difficult, and will
probably soon be impossible, to obtain a pure Green Budgerigar of the
wild type, that is not liable, when it breeds, to produce birds of some
other colour, but so it is that within the space of a very few years
a large number of colour variations have been evolved, and so keen
on these have Budgerigar fanciers become that they are tending to
entirely neglect the wild form. Some of these varieties are certainly
extremely beautiful, and their appearance has caused the Budgerigar
to be one of the most popular of cage and aviary birds as it well deserves
to be. Books on the management and breeding of these Parrakeets

than whom no one that we know of is better suited for the task, for
he has studied Budgerigars and their colour-breeding for many years

which, in our opinion, is no better and no worse than any other glass
for this purpose, because no advantage is gained by attempting to
admit more ultra-violet rays to the shelter when the birds can fly in
the open flight and their nestlings are hidden in boxes, so the
additional expense may well be saved. Winter breeding the
author rightly, we think, discourages, but we should like to
know his authority for stating that " Swallows migrate in sex
flocks " ; and if they did so, that does not prove that Budgerigars do
the same. And what proof has he that wild Budgerigars have but two
nests in the year ? Greene said so, but without quoting his authority.
Campbell tells us that the breeding months are from August to
December, but then he mentions young in July, and further, that in
the Interior " they sometimes breed during the winter ". But these
are minor points, and we can very heartily recommend Mr. Weston's
book as a sound and practical guide to the successful keeping, breeding,
and exhibition of Budgerigars, the treatment of their ailments, and
their correct mating to produce the various colours desired. It is,
attractively produced, with a very nice coloured illustration on the
cover and, at the price, 2s., it is within the reach of everybody. It is
published by Cage Birds, 4 Carmelite Street, E.C. 4.
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
I was very much interested in E. J. Boosey's article on the
Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet, and I see that he mentions about an
eye disease that is easily contracted by these birds. Whilst my
experience with Parrakeets is practically nil, I should like Mr. Boosey
to describe this disease. Eye disease called Xeropthalmia, is very
rampant in various species of Softbills, and fruit-eating species, and is

caused by a deficiency in the food, and I am wondering if it is the same
complaint in the Parrots, etc. If so, I should be pleased to have any

Lord Tavistock considers the plate of this species, which appeared
in our last number, somewhat untrue to life. " The green," he says,
" is too rich and not sufficiently olivaceous and suggests the plumage
of the Orange-bellied Grass Parrakeet," and " a hen Blue-wing never
has an orange abdomen ; her wing-patch is as wide as the male's,
though less vivid and flecked with green, and the yellowish markings
round the eyes are quite well developed ".

ZEBRA FINCHES IN THE WILD STATE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99686" page_id="56221856"  page_num="72" year="" vol="">
In a very interesting paper, published in the January number of
The Emu, Mr. W. D. K. MacGillivray describes an expedition to a spot
in the north-west corner of New South Wales to study the habits of
the Flock Pigeon (Histriophaps histrionica), a species that has recently
reappeared in large numbers after many years' absence. We shall hope
to refer, in our next number, to his success in watching the Pigeons,
but his note on some of his companions at his camp may be quoted
here :--
" There were two cane grass sheds, remains of the old homestead,
near by our camp ; these had been taken possession of by Chestnut-
eared Finches, which had numerous nests in the roof and sides at all
stages of construction, and others containing eggs or young at all
stages of incubation or growth respectively. The Finches were also
nesting in the framework of an old dray. A long, low sandhill, about
a mile out on the plain, and which was topped by stunted hop-bushes,
needle-bushes, a few mulgas, dead finish, and one whitewood, had as
its only bird inhabitants numbers of Chestnut-eared Finches and a
few Crows. The Finches were nesting everywhere. They increase
enormously in a favourable season, like the present, and die in thousands
in a time of drought, often by sticking to a drying waterhole till all the
water has gone, and then not being able to reach any other water."

In my note on Neophema splendida in the February number of
this Journal I referred to a pair acquired by the Zoological Society
in 1871 and stated that " from these a young bird was hatched the
following year, though whether this was reared to maturity or not I
have been unable to discover Further research has shown that the
printed records are incorrect, and it is almost certain that the species
has never bred in captivity ! On page 328 of the eighth edition of the
Zoological Society's official List of Vertebrated Animals, published in
1883, appears the following entry :--

I have looked up the daily occurrence records from which the List of
Vertebrates was compiled and I find that on 21st June, 1872, this
species is not mentioned, whereas on 21st July, 1872, the following
entry occurs : " 1 Splendid Grass Parrakeet, Euphema splendida ,
purchased of Mr. A. Jamrach, 205.," so there can be little doubt that
all the authors who have mentioned this species since the 1883 List
was printed--Euss, Butler, Neunzig, Tavistock, Hopkinson, and myself,
have been led astray by an obvious clerical error in the compilation
of that List.

The Splendid or Bed-breasted Parrakeet was apparently never a
common species anywhere and very few specimens have reached
Europe alive, though to read Greene's Parrots in Captivity one would
imagine that, at the time that was written (1884) it was by no means
impossible to obtain specimens if the dealers were given adequate
inducement to obtain it, for he says, " the Splendid Parrakeet is not
a difficult bird to keep, so that the #10 or so given for him is much
more safely invested than if risked upon a couple of pairs of Paradiseas
or Many-coloured Parrakeets." By the way he writes one would
think he had kept the species, but we may be quite sure he never had
the opportunity to do so, and probably only saw those at the Zoo.
Gedney, whose Foreign Cage Birds is undated (probably about 1876),
was doubtless nearly correct when he wrote of this species : " They
are very rarely met with even in Australia, and no specimen has
ever reached the hands of an English dealer," though we know that
the Zoological Society's specimens came from dealers.
A note in the Proceedings of 1871 referring to the Zoo's original
pair is as follows (page 102) :---
" A pair of the Splendid Grass-Parrakeet (Euphema splendida y
Gould, B. of Aust. v, pi. 42). These are, I believe, the first examples
of this beautiful Grass-Parrakeet ever brought alive to this country.
We purchased them on 30th January from a London dealer, who
states that they were received from a vessel coming from Adelaide."
The price paid for this pair was #7, and for the single bird from
Mr. Jamrach #1 ! At the present time I suppose a pair of these birds
would be worth more like #100.
It is very satisfactory to find that this lovely Parrakeet is probably
no rarer now than it has always been and it is much to be hoped that
the pair owned by our King, and now in this country in the capable
charge of Mrs. Fetherstonhaugh, may be successful in reproducing
their kind.

By W. H. Workman
Have any ofiour members been troubled with this nasty disease
amongst their birds, which is caused by a Nematode by the name of
Syngamus trachealis ? If so my experience and the way we cure it may
be of use to some reader who like myself has had a few losses. The
symptoms are that one notices the affected bird coughing as if it would
choke to death. This is caused by one or more of these horrid thread-
worms which have made a home in the trachea or windpipe and have
settled there to breed. In a short time there will be a family of them
and the bird will die from suffocation. We dissected a Californian
Quail-which died from this worm, finding the worms in the windpipe.
My man asked me to get him some " gapes powder " so as to be ready
in case of another bird being attacked. Sure enough the next victim
was a very fine Pagoda Starling and this is how we treated him with
first-class results. We put him in a box cage, covered the front with
a stout bag, put some of the gapes powder in a little dish inside the
cage. Then we gave the powder two or three vigorous blasts with a
bicycle pump till we had what we call in Ireland " a proper stour ",
which means a thick fog of powder in the cage. We kept the bag
down and allowed the bird to breathe this atmosphere for about
fifteen minutes for about four days, then gave a dose alternate days,
and in a little over a week the bird was completely cured and we put
it back with its mates in the aviary. The powder is very fine, light
grey in colour, and smells strongly of naphthalene : it is called " Kuride "
and seems to work well.
So much for the cure ; now as regards prevention. Poultry keepers
when they get gapes amongst their stock shift their pens to fresh
ground, but this is impossible with fixed aviaries, so one has to resort
to other methods. I have very thoroughly limed my ground with
well-slaked, in fact dead, quicklime and this so far seems to have been
quite effective. I also understand that a sprinkling of common salt
is another good preventative ; it could be sowed on with a little dry
sand as one does weed killers.
One theory regarding the life history of these Nematodes is that

they first pass into the earth, then part of the cycle is passed in the
earthworms which are swallowed by the birds. They then make their
way from the intestines to the trachea. If this is the case, we should
be watchful in the use of earthworms when feeding them to Waders, etc.,
in case they come from bad ground and transmit the disease.

beautiful ground Pigeon that was once to be met with in countless
numbers at certain seasons in the Northern and Central parts of
Australia, but for many years past its numbers have been decreasing
as a result of sheep farming and the ease with which it may be shot
during its regular visits to some favourite drinking pool.
This is one of the most beautiful of the Australian Pigeons, its
upper surface being sandy brown, its breast and abdomen deep violet
grey. The primary features black tipped with white ; the secondaries
edged with metallic green and purple forming a speculum, as in the
other Bronzewings. The male has the forehead white and most of
the head and throat black with two lines of white on the side of the
head, and a large band of white on the lower throat. The female is
easily distinguished by the absence of black on the head which is
buff, the throat being blackish. The legs and feet are red.
It is a purely terrestrial species, never perching upon trees and
nesting upon the ground beneath a tussock or bush.
Very few examples appear to have been imported into this country
and I can only remember seeing one living example, but in 1865 three
specimens were presented to the Zoological Society of London by the
Acclimatization Society of Victoria, and there is a record of these
having bred in the Gardens the following year.
It is very interesting to notice the way in which certain Australian
species that were thought to have become extinct, or to be on the
verge of becoming so, have a way of reappearing when conditions
become more favourable to their existence, such as the cessation of

a long period of drought. And this seems to have happened in the
case of the Harlequin Bronzewing, for in a very interesting article,
accompanying the coloured plate above referred to, Mr. W. D. K.
MacGillivray tells of the appearance of vast numbers of these birds.
He quotes a note from Mr. Ian MacCulloch who, writing from Central
Queensland in March, 1931, remarks: " At present there must be
twenty thousand Flock Pigeons watering at the tank where I am
camped. At another tank on this property about twenty miles from
here there must be four or five times as many birds as there are here.
I first noticed a small flock of Pigeons about twelve months ago, and
after some heavy rains in May last we had a wonderful growth of
grass and herbage. I noticed the birds were nesting in July and up
till September. They did not appear to be greatly worried by the
sheep as they nested in the paddocks in which the sheep were running.
" It is a fine sight to see the flock here come to water. They light
on the surface of the water, drink, and fly again, not troubled in any
way by wet feathers. They also land on the embankment and approach
the water like a regiment of soldiers. The front line drink and fly,
their places are taken by the next line, and so on till all are watered."
It will be observed that the habits of these Pigeons very closely
resemble those of Sand Grouse. Subsequently Mr. MacGillivray had
an opportunity of watching some of these Pigeons himself, which
appeared on a limited area in the north-west corner of Hew South
Wales after an interval of over forty years. Camping near an old
dam, situated in the centre of 6 square miles of Mitchell Grass, " the
birds started to arrive," he remarks, " at 4.40 p.m., in small flocks
of from ten to twenty, the intervals between the arrivals of the flocks
shortening as time went on. The earlier flocks settled in the grass
two hundred yards or more from the water. Later flocks became
bolder, and circled over the water, but would not settle at first, no
doubt from having been shot at. Finally, one or two dropped near
the edge, walked into the water, drank rapidly, and left. Other and
larger flocks kept coming in from all directions. Many settled on the
edge, but several alighted on the deep water, folded their wings, immersed
their heads completely, and had a good drink. They found no difficulty
in rising from the surface of the water and flying off."

Captain C. Scott-Hopkins --
The habit of actually settling on the water like Ducks is of great
interest, though it had been recorded previously in this as well as
in some other species.
Mr. MacGillivray. continues : "A cold wind blew during the night,
and we were glad to be up at dawn to light the fire and prepare break-
fast. The earliest arrivals were a few Galahs which came silently
to the water, and were gone before it was properly light; then a flock
of Budgerigars, Chestnut-eared Finches, and a few Little Crows. The
Pigeons started to come in at a quarter to eight, at first singly, then in
pairs, quickly followed by flocks of from five to thirty. They kept
coming for over half an hour, after which they became fewer, and all
had finished and gone by 9 a.m."

By Captain C. Scott-Hopkins
I have been asked by the editor of the Avicultural Magazine to
give an account of my collection of Fancy Pheasants, which I think
I can safely say, is the finest in Great Britain. There are over thirty
species of pheasants which can be kept in captivity. Some are beyond
the reach of most Pheasant lovers as the prices are very high. I have
kept most kinds, with the exception of about half a dozen. At the
present moment I have about twenty-five different species including
some rare birds. I think many would-be fanciers of these beautiful
birds imagine that because they come from tropical countries they
must be delicate, and they are afraid to keep them. This is by no
means the case. There is only one kind of Pheasant that I have found
too delicate for this climate (although it might thrive better in the
South of England), and that is the beautiful Palawan Peacock Pheasant.
I have had two pairs of these birds bought from Mr. Rogers, of Liver-
pool, but they did not live long. They were, of course, imported birds.
It is only quite recently that they have been imported into Europe
and no home-bred birds are available. I sincerely hope that it will

be found possible to keep and breed these charming Pheasants in this
country. They are certainly the prettiest of the Peacock Pheasants.
Many kinds of Pheasants can be bought quite cheaply and anyone
desiring to start this fascinating hobby should begin with a pair each
of Golden, Silver, Lady Amherst, and Peeves. A cheque for from #10
to #12 would buy you a pair of each of these Pheasants, providing you
do not buy them from dealers. There are none more beautiful than
these four species, they are very hardy and easy to breed, and they
are moreover easy to sell. When keeping the Lady Amherst it is always
advisable to give the male bird at least two hens and preferably three,
as he is a very pugnacious gentleman when spring-time comes round.
Some Amherst cocks will kill nearly every hen given to them, whilst
others are just as docile. Don't let this deter anyone from keeping
these birds as, in my opinion, they are the most beautiful and graceful
of all Pheasants. I always endeavour to keep a good selection of
them, but beware of hybrids ! I should think that 85 per cent of
Amhersts in this country have Golden blood in them. It is surprising
how many people have shown me what they really thought were pure
Amhersts, when they were very far from pure. When I started keeping
Pheasants I was 4 4 had " in the same way !
You are safe with the Golden, Silver, and Reeves. To the beginner
who is ready to put his hand a little deeper in his pocket I would
recommend the Swinhoe, about #12 a pair, very beautiful and hardy.
The pure Mongolian is a fine bird, and difficult to beat for colour
and is quite cheap. The Monaul or Impeyan Pheasant is a magnificent
bird and is always popular and very striking. To see this bird with
the sun shining on his back is a wonderful sight. He is very hardy,
and his price should be #20 to #22 a pair.
I have three species of Tragopans--Satyr, Cabots, and Temmincks.
The Tragopan Pheasant is my favourite. The male bird is superb.
These Pheasants have one great attraction to me, and that is that they
become remarkably tame in a very short time, especially the Satyr.
Unfortunately they are not easy to breed, as I have found it very
difficult to get fertile eggs. The price of these Pheasants should be
about #25 a pair.
Freshly imported birds can be bought for about #6 apiece, and this

Captain C. Scott-Hopkins --
is very often the only way you can procure these birds, as there are
very few bred in this country.
There are four- species of Fireback Pheasants kept in captivity,
three of which I have, the Siamese, the Bornean, and the Yieillot.
The Firebacks are somewhat different in appearance to most Pheasants.
The tail is rounded and not long and they are blessed with enormous
spurs, especially the Yieillot. They are hardy and beautiful but
not easy to rear. They are late layers. The price should be about
#25 a pair.
The Peacock Pheasants ( Polyplectron) are most attractive little
birds and very hardy in spite of the fact that they come from a very
hot country. There are three or four species kept in aviaries, two of
which I have, namely, the Chinquis and the Germain. The former is
the brightest in colour. They are delightful little birds to keep and
soon become quite tame. These birds will incubate their own eggs
and are splendid mothers. Don't let any other Pheasants come near,
as they are very quarrelsome and will kill any bird their own size.
Last summer a pair of young Chinquis got into an aviary full of young
Goldens and Amhersts and two young Edwards : they killed seven,
including one Edward worth #20. One has to put up with such
misfortunes at times. Rats have killed me pounds' worth of birds.
Rat-proof aviaries are worth every penny they cost, but be careful
they are rat-proof !
Peacock Pheasants should cost about #15 a pair, except the two
rare kinds. Edwards and Imperials are somewhat similar in appearance,
the latter being the larger. Both are of a lovely blue, the Edwards
cock having a little white on the head. Edwards are easy to rear.
My pair of Imperials did not lay last year, but I am hoping to get
some eggs this year. Both these are very expensive and the Imperial
is one of the rarest Pheasants known to science. Edwards should be
about #40 a pair and Imperials about #70. The Elliot Pheasant
I can strongly recommend for several reasons. He is a fine upstanding
bird with beautiful colouring and very hardy. They are good layers
and early layers. The chicks are easy to rear, and are very independent
little fellows, finding their own food at a very early age. They are
quick growers.

Elliots are easy to sell, especially in America. The male bird gets
his full plumage the first year. The price is #20 a pair. Many varieties
of Pheasants do not attain full plumage until the second moult. This
is rather a drawback, as it means waiting a whole year before you see
them in their full beauty. Goldens, Amhersts, Silvers, Tragopans,
Monauls, and others all take a year before they are in full plumage.
The Argus Pheasant is a beautiful bird and the largest Pheasant
known. They are not very hardy, and it is very difficult to get fertile
eggs from them. There are three species of Argus kept in aviaries.
They are all rather expensive, especially the Rheinhart (Rheinardia
ocellata), which may cost #60 or more a pair. The Mikado Pheasant
is another rare species. I am fortunate to possess two pairs of these
birds, and hope to breed some this year. They are good layers, I believe,
are hardy, and easy to rear. The predominant colour is dark blue
with white spots. The hens are similar to most Pheasant hens in that
they are dull-coloured compared to their husbands. These birds are
worth about #60 a pair.
The Scemmerring Pheasant is a beautiful bird, and distinctly rare
and difficult to buy. The males are very pugnacious and often kill
their hens. I have given my bird three wives, so I hope he will be
content and not be too rough with them. I was not able to get any
fertile eggs from them last year.
I have not mentioned all the different Pheasants I have or have had,
as it would take up too much space. I will give a list of the Pheasants
I have now actually in stock at the end of my article. Fancy Pheasants
are very inexpensive to keep, they eat less than poultry. The best
corn is wheat all the year round, with a little crushed maize and a
little dari. I feed mine twice a day, but I know some people think once
a day sufficient. I leave it at that. I think a little meal at this time
of year is beneficial and helps their fertility. Plenty of green food all
through the year is absolutely essential. Cabbage in the winter,
dandelions and cut grass in the summer. Fresh water every day,
not every other day. Keep the water tins absolutely clean, and a
little disinfectant in the water once a week is a good thing. Keep your
aviaries scrupulously clean, and in the moulting season (which begins
about July-August) pick up all feathers. In the breeding season, be

sure and gather all eggs every morning or as soon as yon see them, in
case any of your birds get into that dreadful habit of sucking their
eggs. Be sure and have plenty of cover (fir branches, etc.) in the corners
of your aviaries in the breeding season, so that the hens can seek
refuge from the cocks, otherwise the mortality amongst some of your
hens will be terrible. This is most important with every kind of
Pheasant, except the Tragopan which is a real gentleman and I have
never known him molest his wife. She does not nest on the ground,
as every other Pheasant does.
I do hope this short account of my Pheasants will encourage others
to go in for this delightful hobby. Don't get downhearted if you have
a bad year now and then. Keep plodding on and your patience will
be well rewarded. Last summer was the worst I ever experienced.
I am hoping and expecting much better luck this summer. I shall be
very pleased to give any information and help to would-be Pheasant
keepers, and I shall be delighted to show bird lovers my collection.
I take this opportunity of thanking the editor, Mr. Seth-Smith, for
allowing me so much space in the Avicultural Magazine.

NESTING HABITS OF THE RED-FACED LOVEBIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981925894736842" page_id="56221875"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
In his very excellent Birds of Tropical West Africa , of which the
second volume is just published, Mr. David Bannerman writes of the
breeding habits of Agapornis pullaria : "In Sierra Leone Major Scovil
found it breeding in a Woodpecker-like hole scooped out from the side
of the mud nest of a species of termite which builds in trees. Colonel
Thompson corroborates this # situation ', having many times seen
these holes himself. In Cameroon Bates found the same thing, the
ants' nest he describes as hard and earthy and firmly attached to the
large stem of the aseng tree. Big ants inhabited this nest, and savagely
attacked a boy who climbed it; the Lovebirds appeared not to be
molested, and are evidently permitted by the ants to rear their brood
in peace, the ants successfully warding off intruders ! "
The fact that the Red-faced Lovebird, although it has been known
to aviculture from a very remote period, has never been known to
breed in captivity, may be accounted for by the absence of suitable
nesting sites. Perhaps some aviculturist will try the experiment of
constructing an artificial mud ants' nest in a tree and trust that the
birds will excuse the absence of the ants !

I had a fertile egg from the hybrid Yellow-rumped Serin X Canary,

on the edge of which was perched a large Rook. I asked about it, as
it looked so unusual and the bird so placid ! and was told it belonged
to the chef of the hotel, so~ I asked if I might see the bird, which I was
allowed to do. The chef showed off her pet with much pride, though
he was a little " peeved " at being taken from the nice warm kitchen.

(1) The crossing of different species may serve a definite purpose in
proving the relationship of certain birds to one another or the origin
of certain forms. For instance the breeding of Pheasants in captivity
has shown that the crossing of any two forms of the genus Phasianus
produces fertile offspring, whereas Phasianus mated to any other
genus of Pheasant results in sterile hybirds. The crossing of various
species of Agapornis also produces interesting results. But at the
same time it is to be feared that many take up hybrid breeding with no
other object than to produce curiosities.
(2) We understand that the Silver Pheasant ( Gennceus nycthemerus),
a common aviary bird, is nearly extinct in the wild state, and the wild
Golden Pheasant ( Chrysolophus pictus) is said to be very rare, while,
to turn to Mammals, the American Bison, Mountain Zebra, Blesbok,
and Bontebok have been saved from extinction by a life in semi-
captivity.
(3) Certainly no species of birds have been rendered extinct owing
to the desires of avieulturists to secure specimens.

EYE DISEASES

In reply to Mr. Hastings' letter with regard to the reference, in
my article on Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets, to the susceptibility of
the species to eye disease.
It is a complaint of which, I am thankful to say, I have had, so far,
no personal experience ; partly, perhaps, because none of the Grass
Parrakeets we possess here at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm have
ever arrived previously infected ; and partly because, as I stated in
my article, we give nearly all our Parrakeets a separate aviary to each
pair of birds, thus minimizing the risk of subsequent infection.
The study of the diagnosis, cure, and prevention of the varied,
and, as in the case of Septicsemia, mysterious maladies that afflict
Parrakeets in captivity, and to some extent, according to Dr. Hamilton,
in a wild state also, is, comparatively, in its infancy. I imagine, how-
ever, that the Xerophthalmia, which, in Mr. Hastings' letter, he
refers to as being so prevalent among soft-food eaters, is entirely

different to the eye disease which attacks the members of the Grass
Parrakeet family, also to a lesser extent others, particularly the
Polyteline Parrakeets--and is a form of conjunctivitis, and usually
fatal.
Incidentally, it would be interesting to know whether the latter is
the same as the eye complaint from which Dr. Hamilton found wild-
caught Many-colours suffering in Australia though, from his descrip-
tion, it sounds not unlike Catarrhal Fever, in which the eyelids rapidly
become so swollen and inflamed as to render the bird temporarily
blind.
For a description of the eye disease I mentioned in my article on
Blue-wings, I cannot do better than refer Mr. Hastings to page 46 of
Lord Tavistock's book Parrots and Parrot-liJce Birds, where he will
find a complete account of the symptoms of Contagious Conjunctivitis,
as it affects Parrakeets, particularly of the Neophema group.
The account is too long to quote in full, but in it Lord Tavistock
says : " Eye disease may make its first appearance either in an acute
or in a chronic form. In the former case the area round one or both
eyes suddenly swells up enormously so that the eyes themselves
become almost closed, the bird may linger for several weeks or even
months, but finally succumbs either from general debility or through
the formation of an abscess pressing on the brain."
" In the chronic form of the disease nothing may be noticed for six
or seven months beyond a very slight tendency to close the eye partially
or blink a little more frequently than normally. The bird's general
health and appetite remain good and it may even show signs of playful-
ness. Gradually, however, the symptoms become more marked, and
the disease slowly assumes an acute form ..." After that, it would
seem, the bird's fate is usually sealed.

A BI-COLOURED BUDGERIGAR
I think you will be interested in a description of a wonderful Freak
Budgie that I now have in my possession. The bird is a typical Sky-
Blue on the whole of one side and a typical Green on the other.

Correspondence
The head, is, on the whole, more Blue than Green, and the mask is
white, though there are a few yellow feathers among the white on
the right (the green) side. The remarkable feature about this bird
is the very regular division of the blue and white feathers on the
left side of the bird from the yellow and green on the right side. This
division runs down the very centre of the back from the mask to the
tail and a ruler might have been used to define it, so straight and regular
is it even on the rump. One wing is the typical blue and white, the
other the typical green and yellow. The dividing line on the breast is
not so regular and straight, but, even so, there is not a blue feather on
the left or a green one on the right after allowing about a quarter of an
inch for the mixed feathers in the centre of the breast. The under tail
feathers too, when spread out, are perfectly divided, the blue and
white of the Blue Budgie on the left and the green and yellow on the
right side.
The bird is about six months old and has completed the head moult,
I should judge from the " mealy " appearance of the wings (both the
blue and the green) that these are still the nest plumage.
The bird was bred by a friend of mine from a Blue mated to a
Green-Blue. It appears to be perfectly healthy and was bred and
wintered in a very exposed outdoor aviary. The left foot is deformed,
and the bird is on the small side, but not smaller than most of this
breeder's birds. It is a male.
I believe I read an account of a similar bird (or was it a Love Bird ?)
being bred at the Gardens. Is this one still in existence ? I took mine
to Primley Zoo this morning, Mr. Whitley was not there, but Miss
Salter was most interested in it.
I am sorry I did not hear of this freak before the Palace Show,
it would have been a near rival of your beautiful Blue Love Birds !
Percy Newman.
[A Budgerigar similar to the one described was exhibited at the
Crystal Palace a few years ago and was afterwards purchased by Lord
Rothschild and deposited for a time in the Zoological Gardens. This
was a male that had been produced in Germany. A second example,
a female, was bred in France and sent to me when dead, though on
arrival it was too decomposed for anatomical examination. --Ed.]

By P. W. Teague
It has been suggested that some further and fuller notes on my
experiences in breeding Gouldian Finches would be useful to other
enthusiasts, including those in New Zealand, who have often asked for
articles on the keeping and breeding of the more or less common birds.
I have specialized in these birds and I can claim to have been fairly
successful with them, but beginning with Gouldian Finches in England
was anything but a cheerful or hopeful proposition, for practically
the only information I could get was : " Yes, very beautiful birds,
but they only seem to die," or, " they don't last long--like spring
flowers."
I enquired from as many sources as I could, including members
of our Society, and these are a few of the encouraging replies I got:
No. 1 : " Once acclimatized they do quite well for a time, and most
of them will attempt nesting, but my experience is, that the young
very rarely live more than three to four months--I have had nest
after nest of them and all have gone the same way, so I have given
them up in despair." No. 2 : "I commenced the season with four
pairs and have now only one cock bird left--all seem to die for no
apparent reason." No. 3 : " They are very beautiful, but not worth
wasting your money on, sell them out as soon as you can and cut your
losses." I nearly did this, for all had the same cheerful tale. However,
I decided to try methods which had proved very successful with birds.
I had kept when abroad, although many things I use now were
unobtainable there.
Necessity is the mother of invention, and this is how I came to find
out one of the finest revivers or foods I have yet used. I live miles
from a chemist's shop so was compelled to use anything I could think
of that we had in the house, to revive a Gouldian Finch which arrived.
a mere feathered skeleton, and so exhausted and bad that if you touched
it, over it fell and there it lay until you picked the poor thing up again.
I hadn't the usual brandy or whisky, but there happened to be some
Virol at hand. A small quantity of this was diluted with warm water,
and as the bird was too weak to drink or eat, my wife and I kept-

dipping its beak into this Virol water, until it began to show signs
of reviving, then it began to shell some soaked seeds; finally recovering
it is now one of my best breeders.
There is no need for me to waste space by attempting to describe
this lovely bird, well known to most of you, but its colouring is gorgeous,
and a true description of the brilliant colours would sound almost
unbelievable to those who have not seen it. I have kept numerous
kinds of birds from time to time, but amongst the seed-eaters, the
Gouldian is one of the most beautiful. It is clean in its habits, and
dainty in every sense of the word, whilst the sibilant little song of the
cock bird is really most pleasing, and so is his quaint little love dance.
A group of ten or a dozen of these brilliantly coloured birds together
in full plumage is a lovely sight.
I cannot tell you anything about its wild life, but I will attempt
to tell you my observations of them in cages and aviaries. They can
be bred with comparative ease in either the outdoor aviary, or a good
sized breeding cage in the house. Some of the most successful hatches
I have had have been in box-pattern breeding cages, 36 X 11 X 16 in.
with a nest-box fixed at one end, well hidden by bits of heather, broom,
and empty millet sprays. Give them plenty of nice soft hay for building
and leave them alone. You will soon hear when you have any young
in the nest. Many have asked me what sort of a nesting box to use,
if anything they show a preference for those small cardboard bird
travelling boxes, and the next best is an ordinary foreign Finch nest-
box, only add a deeper piece of wood to the front. You can give them
a good choice in an aviary, but in the breeding cage I find they will
take to the one provided as a rule, if they intend breeding. Incubation
takes 12 to 13 days, but I have had them go 15 days. The nesting
plumage of the young is plain dusky green, shading to fawn under the
breast without any of the adult coloration. In spite of what previous
writers in our Magazine have said, I find they take a long time to come
into complete adult plumage, and very often not until the second
moult at 18 months or 2 years old; individual birds differ
considerably. I have hatched and successfully reared Gouldians
from early May up to and including December, and I have birds
in my aviaries representing each of those months, so I am not writing

on observations from an odd nest or two, for I am now well away with
my second generation, and have strong hopes of breeding my third
generation this next summer. Out of fourteen youngsters hatched
in May and June, twelve were kept in the outside aviary, unheated,
and with no artificial light--the other two were brought indoors
and kept in a cage. These two completed their moult when about
10 months old, whilst the twelve outside had not completed theirs
until 12 months old or more. Two August hatched birds were kept
together, fed and treated exactly alike, one moulted completely
to adult plumage except its head at 9 months old, whilst the other,
which is now 19 months old has scarcely changed a feather, yet another
from a December hatch, was half through its moult when 6 months
old then stopped, leaving it with a very patchy appearance.
Personally, I prefer the early hatched birds, because there is often
an abundance of fresh seeding grasses and green food to be obtained
which gives the youngsters that extra bit of stamina to stand the strain
of winter and the moult. Yet on the other hand my feeding method
has successfully reared the very late ones and it will help the town
enthusiasts who experience great difficulty in obtaining fresh seeding
grasses. The great danger in late breeding is egg-binding in the hens,
and one must be constantly looking out for this. Probably there
is nothing new about my feeding methods except perhaps the frequent
use of Virol in the water, neither am I going to suggest you try
experiments I saw recommended by a certain writer a little time ago.
I was forced to experiment and I have paid the usual price, but it was
the only way I could get any satisfactory information about these
birds. Individual Gouldians, like human beings, have varied tastes,
with one exception, and that is, they all eat a large proportion of canary
seed, so give them the best. In addition I give white millet and red
millet--some Gouldians are very fond of red millet, whilst others
scarcely touch it. Indian millet is also supplied, but chiefly in the form
of spray millet. All seeds are given in separate hoppers which
I make out of half-pint bottles on the same principle as the water
bottle. These hoppers I stand on two rails (2 inches or so from the
bottom) in a box about 5 inches deep and long enough to stand all the
bottles in with a space of about J in. between each, this allows

all husks to fall into the box and not be scattered all over the aviary,
and it will catch any seed split. This is a useful suggestion for all
aviculturists who like to keep their aviaries clean and tidy. Care
should be taken to have a small shallow receptacle under the neck
of the bottle hopper, then the bird will crack the seed over the side
thus keeping the seed receptacles more or less free of husks. If these
bottle hoppers are properly arranged you need have no fear of their
failing to work so long as they are kept in the aviary out of the rain.
By giving the seeds separately, you cater for the individual tastes,
and economy in seed. In addition to the above-mentioned seeds,
I also have one containing Niger seed--here again some are quite fond
of this and others only eat it occasionally. The use of this seed has been
strongly condemned as too fattening for a somewhat sluggish bird
like the Gouldian, but mine have it winter and summer. I shall be glad
to know how to make a Gouldian over-fat, for I have not yet discovered
the secret, as it is a dainty feeder and it will rarely eat the things we
consider good for it. Spray millet appears to be almost essential to these
birds, but I had one exception and this bird did not touch it until
it was over 12 months old. It is now making up for lost time. I soak
all millet sprays in cold water for three or four days, changing the water
daily, but don't give it wet in severe frosty weather. Before using,
dip the spray in hot water for a moment or two, but if the spray
has commenced to sprout, only thoroughly wash it in warm water
so that you do not injure the tender sprouts. I also give my birds
daily--if it is eaten up--soaked seeds. No doubt with these soaked
seeds I have unconsciously produced certain foods now known
as Vitamins. It was the daily use of these soaked seeds that brought
me many successes in rearing birds whilst I was abroad, because where
I lived any foods out of the ordinary were unobtainable. I believe
these soaked seeds play an important part in my success with Gouldians
in England, combined with the frequent use of Virol water, or it may
be due to a combination of feeding and management. I soak seed
in the proportion of three tablespoonfuls of canary to one of white
millet--sometimes plain canary seed only. White millet takes a very
long time to soak and germinate therefore it is an advantage to soak
this seed separately if possible giving it a longer soak. These seeds

are placed for soaking in a perforated zinc strainer--similar to a coffee-
pot strainer (this shape *) and then stood in a jar or tin of cold
water. The idea of these strainers is to facilitate easy cleaning of the
seeds and changing of the water. These soaking seeds give off an
offensive smell unless the water is changed at least once a day. This
is only a moments job holding the strainer under the tap. I have
five of these strainers, four of which are always in use and these are
all numbered so that I know which one to use, should they get mixed.
For instance if you are using No. 1 to-day, fill up the empty No. 5,
then when the next one is used, refill No. 1 and so on. It will be noticed
these seeds are soaking four or five days--sometimes longer except
in summer as the seeds germinate quicker. Before use, thoroughly
wash seed in the strainer under the tap, and if seed not much sprouted,
dip into hot water for a moment or two to ensure thorough cleanliness
and quick drying. Now stand strainer of seeds on a damp cloth to draw
all surplus water off, this is quicker and far more convenient than
trying to dry the seed between a cloth. The seeds are then placed in
a basin to which I add a teaspoonful of good honey--or fine castor sugar,
honey for preference--thoroughly mix, then add a tablespoonful of small
seeds, again mix and allow to stand as long as convenient to soak up the
honey. Allow about half a teaspoonful per bird daily, when feeding
young replenish whenever necessary. This is my stock mixture of small
seeds: Equal parts of grass, dandelion, and niger seeds, half parts
of white lettuce and maw seeds, and a bit of gold of pleasure seed--
or a bit of thistle seed; but I don't use the latter now as I have
a garden ! I also offer this small seed mixture occasionally dry and they
enjoy it. This mixture is the outcome of close observation of what they
like, some favouring one seed and some another. I cannot give you
any whys and wherefores for the above mixtures or methods. They are
entirely my own and the fact remains that their efficacy has been proved
by practical results both for rearing young G-ouldians and keeping
them in good health and condition. The above may appear to be a lot
of trouble, but you will find it is really quite easy and the birds enjoy
the changes, and who of you would not go to this little extra trouble
to keep one of the loveliest birds living in good health and condition ?
When feeding the soaked seed mixture only put small quantities at

a time in small shallow dishes, and place these on a grid or a bunch
of used millet spray to keep dirt and sand from getting into it when
the birds hop on to the dish. Another thing by only placing a small
quantity in each dish the husks will not hide the seeds at the bottom.
Do not try to take a short cut to soften the seeds by boiling them, as
was once suggested to me. It is not the same because you do not
want to soften the seed only, it is the slow soaking which allows the seed
to germinate and get pulpy that is wanted, thus I suppose, producing
more naturally certain vitamins. In separate dishes offer a few short
oats and an occasional bit of crushed hemp seed, but be very sparing
with the latter as it appears to have a peculiar effect on the bowels.
I have also experimented with the use of C.L.O. for these birds with
unfortunate results and I regret to say I cannot recommend its use,
although I have had good results from it on other birds. I am now
experimenting with " Radio-Malt " by adding a small quantity to the
soaked seed mixture. The birds certainly enjoy this and like the malt
flavour. When rearing young also offer a little sweetened bread and
milk, or a bit of sponge cake soaked in milk, one or two small meal-
worms, or a bit of insectile mixture. Some will eat a bit of egg and
biscuit, but I find the many proprietary brands of soft food are rarely
if ever, touched. I have tried nearly all makes, and even starved
the Gouldians in the attempt to induce them to eat it, but without
success. Give as many fresh seeding grasses daily as you can obtain,
their favourite being Rye grass (tinker-tailor grass). Also a clod
or turf of grass from which they will eat quite a lot of the tender blades.
I also turn these clods upside down for them to pick over, this they
greatly enjoy. I find they prefer tender grass to almost all other
green food, but they will eat lettuce, dandelion, and sow thistle and,
very occasionally, watercress. I also throw them chickweed, groundsell,
etc., but I have never seen them eat any. Keep ringing the changes
with your foods, except the staple seeds, and to borrow an expression
from the Marquess of Tavistock, " Use some bird sense." When
giving fresh grasses, pick these with long stems and place in a jar of water
to keep them fresh, taking care to fill the neck of the receptacle with
grass or something to prevent the birds attempting to reach the water
or you will surely have an accident. I have kept grasses fresh in this

way for a week or more. This is another useful hint. In addition
to the usual sand in the cages and aviaries I mix the following grit:
Save all the egg-shells from the household, bake them in the oven,,
and then smash up small; add to this some very fine flint chicken
grit, fine powdered oyster shell--or cockle shell grit--a bit of old mortar
if obtainable, and some small broken cuttlefish bone. Keep a shallow
tin of this in your aviaries as well as scattering a little on the floors.
Personally, I attach great importance to this grit mixture, and you
will be amazed at the quantity they will eat. I know some people
deprecate the use of egg-shells on account, they say, of it teaching
the birds to eat eggs. I have never had a bird take to this bad habit,
although I have kept and reared birds rather longer than I care
to remember. I have never had Gouldians to eat cuttlefish bone
from the piece but they will eat a little when broken up into small
pieces. When kept in cages they are fond of pecking at rock salt,
but I never see them do so in the aviaries. My birds usually get cold
boiled water to drink and bathe in, and I only give them a bath on
very favourable days in winter. I prefer to boast of having a live bird
to a clean dead one. To those who can arrange it, don't leave the bath
water in the aviaries after lunch in our treacherous climate. This
refers more especially to winter. The Gouldians love to bathe by rubbing
themselves in wet grass, so lightly sprinkle a turf of grass for a change.
Now how to use and mix the Virol: I cannot speak too highly
of this, for I have given it a thorough test and I have used it regularly
on my Gouldians the last four years. Prepare it in the proportion
of one teaspoonful to half a pint of warm water--not boiling. When
first starting to give this, make the solution weaker for the first few
times. This Virol solution I give two or three times a week, if weather
not too hot--and almost daily during the winter and when moulting.
Continue its use on the young stock until after they moult. The birds
get to like it and I have seen them drink this solution in preference
to plain water. It should be mixed fresh daily, and economize by giving
only sufficient for the day if possible, and take care to place the Virol
water out of the sun. I have had some wonderful results from its use
combined with my other methods given above--good health in stock,
large percentage of fertile eggs, and vigorous young birds. The one

drawback to Virol water is, the birds will try and bathe in it unless
it is given in very small vessels. A 3 s. 9 d. jar of Virol lasts me over
six months. An Australian enthusiast visiting my aviaries said he had
never seen Gouldians with such sheen and clean beaks even in the wild
state.
In hopes of preventing the usual intestinal troubles we get in
the summer, I tried Yadil in the drinking water on alternate days.
As the season was an exceptionally cool one I can hardly judge this
experiment, but I lost no birds from this complaint last summer.
If you do get a bird with intestinal trouble I know of no better medicine
(and I have tried many) than Galloway's " Pinko ". I am indebted
to Mr. Hicks for the recommendation of this excellent preparation.
If you are unfortunate enough to have a sick bird, cage it separately
and have it in your living room if possible, for they seem to like human
company. Clean the cage out daily and provide a supply of well
soaked thoroughly washed millet spray fresh daily, also some of the
soaked seed mixture previously mentioned, in a tiny finger drawer
pushed between the cage wires. The finger tins I use measure
1 |inches long by J in. deep and this rests on the perch through
the wires. You will find this method of feeding a sick bird almost
irresistible, for if the bird can get on to the perch at all it can't resist
picking from this finger drawer--try it and see.
When breeding, I only allow one pair to a cage or small aviary
and you are more likely to succeed if they are entirely by themselves.
You can associate a few Waxbills and a pair of Bengalese in the same
small aviary, but some Gouldians even resent their presence when
nesting. All breeders of foreign Finches should keep a few of these
wonderful little foster parents--Bengalese--I have even got Bengalese
to hatch and rear birds when they themselves have not laid an egg---
but this is another story. Gouldians should be separated (the sexes)
in the winter or you will have numerous losses from egg-binding.
I have not described an aviary as most people have their own ideas
on this point, and the design depends on the money one has to spare.
I have fitted removable Windolite shutters to all my aviaries, these
are a great comfort to the birds, especially during the winter and
wet weather. Gouldians do not like cold winds. I do not believe

in putting the birds to unnecessary discomfort under the illusion
that they are being made hardy, although they can stand plenty
of dry cold when shut in their shelters, but not the conditions some
people provide for them. I have seen aviaries with no other cover
than the shelter shed--the owners forgetting the fact that birds are
not quite blessed with the same sense as themselves--and then they
wonder why they die !
The ground in this district is heavy wet clay and very exposed,
so I have entirely boarded the floors of my four small aviaries. This
I find a great improvement in every way. My birds get no artificial
heat or light during the winter, except after a very dark winter day
I occasionally provide a lantern for them to have a late evening feed,
yet I think a little heat would be beneficial in the winter. My aviaries
are free from draughts, wet, and cold winds, and in this way I have kept
between twenty and thirty Gouldians in perfect health and condition
the last two winters. If you do see a bird looking out-of-tone or unhappy
catch it up and bring indoors. You may have to do this as their
moulting period varies, some commencing in October and November--
but most of them moult in February, March, and April.
Keep your cages, aviaries, and all utensils thoroughly clean.
Perhaps some of you will wonder what my losses are or have been.
Well, I am not afraid to tell you because I keep careful notes. Total
number of deaths : five in the last four years, made up as follows : Two
hens, egg-binding trouble, one of which I killed through over-anxiety ;
one from jaundice and biliary fever--directly traceable to the C.L.O.
experiment; two from enteritis (intestinal inflamation), newly acquired
pair. That reminds me to recommend all who wish to start Gouldians
to purchase acclimatized birds or British aviary bred specimens if
possible. They may cost more, but it is worth it.
I find many have failed to rear young Gouldians to maturity
because they have been fed almost entirely on dry millet spray and
seed, with the result that they lack stamina.
Many of you no doubt hatch and rear them without this little
extra trouble, stick to your own method if successful; but to those
who have not been so fortunate, try the above method, for it has proved
successful to other Gouldian enthusiasts who had previously failed.

In conclusion, I hope these notes will prove useful, and help to bring
success to the many Gouldian admirers--and they are many.
N.B.--After writing the above notes, the 19 months old bird
mentioned went in the moult and died suddenly. The P.M. said :
" Death due to exposure "---probably the result of the severe weather
at the time.
It appears significant that of the deaths mentioned in four years,
only one bird was of my own breeding.

By Alfred Ezra, O.B.E.
Many of our readers know that our fellow member, Dr. Satya
Churn Law, is the happy possessor of large aviaries about ten miles
from Calcutta, where the most difficult Indian insectivorous birds,
as well as many foreign species are kept in most perfect condition,
and very often bred.
Last winter, I took the opportunity, when on a visit to Calcutta,
to visit these fine aviaries twice, spending two whole mornings with
Dr. Law.
Dr. Law is not only a keen and able aviculturist, he is also an
excellent ornithologist, botanist, and naturalist in general, all his work
being carried out in a thoroughly scientific way. Among his many
degrees and qualifications, he is an Honorary Correspondent of the
Zoological Survey of India, and in this capacity, has completely
revised, since 1926, the collection of bird skins in the Indian Museum,
at the same time collecting numerous species and valuable data on
several expeditions in different parts of India. Eor a very long time
Dr. Law has been particularly interested in solving the difficult
problems of feeding and housing delicate birds under tropical conditions.
All the year round, the most delicate birds are given live ant cocoons,
grasshoppers, larvae and pupae of Oecophylla smaragdina, while the staple
diet of all birds is " suttoo " (grain meal). The aviaries consist of small
inside shelters and large flights, all covered with bamboo matting,
which protects the birds from the sun as well as from Kites and Crows.

They are also protected against ants, which are such a curse to

a narrow cemented canal filled - with water. As will be seen by the
photographs here reproduced, the flights are planted thickly with
suitable shrubs. The bird accommodation consists of the following :--

N.B.--Breeding results were obtained from Birds marked (*) during
1930-31.
I was delighted to notice that most of the birds were in perfect
health, and showed their brightest natural colours, which so often,
unfortunately, fade in our dry indoor aviaries in Europe. Practically
all the birds are tame, and a good number nest and rear young every
year, particularly the interesting and difficult bird, the Iora.
Among Dr. Law's greatest successes at hand-rearing birds from the
nest, I might mention his successful rearing of the Paradise Flycatcher
(Terpsiphone paradisi) and of the Fantail Flycatcher (Rhipidura
albicollis) two insectivorous species particularly difficult to keep
in captivity. My visits to Dr. Law's beautiful aviaries will long
remain a happy memory, while the sight of so many rare and delicate
Indian birds reminded me of the bygone days, when the late Major
Perreau used to bring us, periodically, those beautiful birds of the
Indian jungles, rarely seen nowadays in our English aviaries.

The Marquess of Tavistock--A Study in Feminine Psychology 108
A STUDY IN FEMININE PSYCHOLOGY
By The Marquess oe Tavistock
Among the older members of my collection is a ben Barnard's
Parrakeet. How long I have bad ber I do not clearly remember, but
it cannot be far short of twenty years. Although still hale and hearty,
not to say exuberant in spirits, she has done no good as a breeder.
At times I have wondered if she were not sterile, so complete has been
her indifference to nest-boxes of every sort and pattern ; but I believe,
after all, her trouble has been mental rather than physical. Home
duties do not appeal to her, and the husbands I supplied have left
her cold. Barnards are very temperamental birds. Indeed, I have
known a higher percentage of cranks among Barnards than among
men, which is more than I can say of any other living creature !
Last autumn, having grown weary of the old lady's persistent
refusal to lay a single egg, I decided to let her take her chance as a liberty
bird. She would enjoy herself and if she strayed she would be no great
loss. I expected her to take little or no interest in the cock she had
lived with for the past four years, and I thought she would wander
about a good deal. In this I was wrong. For some time she never
left the cock's aviary and insisted on roosting on the open wire of the
flight, in spite of every effort I made to oblige her to seek more safe
and comfortable quarters for the night.
In a little while she began to feel more at home. She discovered
another pair of Barnards a few aviaries away. This was great
fun. Not since she left her home-land nearly a quarter of a
century ago had she had the chance of a real good fight and
hen Barnards love fighting almost as much as the sterner sex.
By the end of a really enjoyable day she had bitten the cock's
foot and got the upper hand of the hen in spite of a double lot of
intervening wire netting. A little later she had an equally pleasing
row with the Yellow-rumps, and bit the hen's toe. To do her justice,
however, she was not a bully. Having drawn blood and, in her opinion,
won on points, she no longer annoyed her adversaries, nor did she attack
the Kings, Crimson-wings and Barrabands at liberty--inoffensive
creatures unworthy of the prowess of a true sportswoman. She never

went any distance away. Occasionally, I would hear her loud, sweet
whistling as she crossed the field to some oak trees a few hundred yards
off, but that was the limit of her excursions.
Then the unexpected happened. She fell in love at last! Earlier
in the winter I had obtained a parr of Mealy Rosellas. They were not
a very good pair, and the hen soon died of a rather curious ailment,
leaving her husband a disconsolate widower. What the hen Barnard
saw in him I cannot imagine, but the fact remains that she fell for him
utterly and completely ! Her behaviour was very amusing. She
was a larger and far more powerful bird than he and could have chewed
him up in a minute had she desired to do so, but she knew perfectly
well that if there is one thing more than another that a gentleman
Broadtail appreciates in his fiancee it is a timid and modest behaviour,
so, for the first time in her life, she became really coy. It is perfectly
certain that she was not really in the least afraid of the Mealy. He had
been most polite from the first; indeed, I am sure that the rapturous
whistle: " What a perfectly divine creature ! " which struck
unexpectedly on her ear as she toured the aviaries in search of fresh
conquests for her beak, effected, at long last, the conquest of her
heart. Ho one had ever called her that before ! So day after day she
came to the Mealy's aviary and settled on it and near it, though if ever
he approached her very closely she edged demurely away.
Poor old thing ! I am afraid I treated her rather badly, though it
was just a little her own fault. For a time I was tempted to make her
happy by releasing her lover, but I really did not dare, for fear of the
mischief they might do by fighting. Even as an unattached spinster
she had been far too rowdy ; as a triumphant bride, she would have
maimed half the Broadtails in the collection ! Moreover, I did not in
the least want hybrids and someone else required the Mealy, so I
hardened my heart and sent him away.
A few days later she was back on the Cock Barnard's aviary and
as hen Parrakeets make far less fuss about a change of partners than
cocks do, I assumed that she had decided to make the best of a bad
job and forget her idyll. But in a very few moments I noticed something
in her demeanour which had not been there when she had sat on the
.aviary at the time of her release. There was a nasty intentness about

the way she peered down at the cock and a sinister expedition in her
movements as she followed him to and fro. I knew that look. Some
years ago I had had a cock Yellow-bellied Parrakeet. He possessed
a mate of whom he was reasonably fond, but not so fond that, when
released in autumn, he was content to stay near her, as a normally
dutiful Broadtail husband will always do. He desired company as little
as he feared the hardships of the English winter, and he would roam
the countryside in solitude, being often not seen for months at a stretch.
But when in late April the trees were covered with bursting buds and
the groves were musical with the songs of mating birds, a call sounded
in the lonely wanderer's heart bringing him home unerringly year after
year. Was it thoughts of his disconsolate wife and hopes of baby
Parrakeets in a dark log that drew him back ? Not a bit of it! He used
bo return to kill a certain cock Yellow-rump : for that purpose and for
that purpose alone. Why he wanted to kill that particular Yellow-
rump more than any other bird in the collection I have no idea, the
less so that he never took the slightest interest in him during the winter.
But as soon as late April came round, as regular as clockwork, the
over-mastering conviction that the Yellow-rump was a thing unfit
to live would enter the Yellow-belly's mind, and back he would travel
over field and forest to do him in. On arrival he would spend all day
glaring at the Yellow-rump through the wire roof and following him
wherever he went, until, by placing his intended victim in a cage
as a decoy, we lured him into an aviary and thence returned him to
.spend another summer in domestic dulness with his own mate.
The expression and actions of the murderous Yellow-belly were
now plainly those of the hen Barnard. Her blighted hopes had turned
her heart to gall and bitterness, and she was bent on venting her feelings
on her former companion. Why he should have been blamed, poor
fellow, I cannot imagine. If there was to be unpleasantness at all over
the Mealy incident it might more justly have been shown by him ;
but what angry and heart-broken elderly lady was ever reasonable ?
I suppose when she came back to the cock Barnard, after finding
the Mealy's aviary empty, everything about him grated on her by
contrast with the charms of the dear departed, and so, like the
Psalmist, he was hated without a cause.

I had hopes, somewhat faint, I must admit, that, as the cock
Barnard had always been master before, he might put the virago
in her place when she was let in with him. It was no use, however ;
she went for him like a tigress ; he made no attempt to stand up to her
and I had to separate them to save his life. By way of discipline
I subjected her to 10 days' solitary confinement in the Mealy's empty
aviary, partly to convince her of his absence ; partly to bore her into
better behaviour. I had little anticipation, however, that the plan would
succeed as no cock Barnard I have ever had who disliked a hen as much
as she disliked the cock has ever relented under any circumstances,
whatever. If she would not behave I meant to cut her wing but.
I decided to give her one more chance.
Accordingly at the end of her time of penance she was transferred-
back to the cock's aviary. At the sight of the catching-net, which
contained her, he slipped into the shelter and we waited outside to.

display but eyed her cautiously and uncertainly. I expected
her to fly at him, the more so as a hen Broadtail despises a
cowardly suitor as much as a cock dislikes a too forward bride..
Femina mutabilis semper ! She didn't go for him, though by every
rule of Broadtail misconduct she should have done so. The old hussy
dropped her shoulders in a slight display of greeting and whenever
he could not avoid approaching her a little, she very ostentatiously
and demurely edged away or flew on to another perch. She might
have fretted and gone back in condition ? Not a bit of it. When she
heard the other pair of Barnards she was as keen as anything to fight,
them. She was a woman of the world, that's all !

By W. H. Workman, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
In all the papers on this side of the Atlantic, and on the other,
which are devoted to onr favourite hobby we find innumerable articles
on, and directions how to feed and care for, all the small birds, especially
those belonging to the Passeres or perching family of birds, and of these
I think the Waxbills and Weavers get most attention. Now with
our editor's permission I should like very much to give some infor-
mation about the larger birds which can be kept in captivity, either
loose about one's garden or in an aviary, and here let me remark that
quite large birds can be kept in a garden say in the suburbs of any
of our big cities with most excellent results as far as the health of the
birds is concerned and with the greatest pleasure to their owner and
his friends.
Lord Tavistock, in his article on Cranes in Aviculture , commences
with these words : " Anyone who has a park or large space at his
disposal will find Cranes extremely interesting to keep. Their large
size, majestic deportment, and beautiful plumage, are all points in their
favour ; besides which they are easily fed, most are hardy, and the
probability that they will live at least half as long as their owner."
Therefore as a start I want to tell you all about my pair of
Demoiselle Cranes (Anthrojpoides virgo) and how I made up my mind
to try them in quite a small garden about J acre in area. When
I read in the above article how that the birds would live for half a life
time I made up my mind to get busy at once as I am sorry to say half
a life time is past for me, so with any luck on both sides if I were
to enjoy my Cranes for a long time the sooner I got them the better.
Now I had the very best of good luck for I got a present (just think
of it) from a very well-known aviculturist of a most beautiful pair
of Demoiselles. They arrived at my place from the London Zoo where
they had been deposited for pinioning. This slight operation had been
most successfully carried out and I would state here and now that it
is most necessary to have Cranes pinioned, otherwise some fine day
you will find the birds flown, I will describe the operation later.
The Cranes arrived in a huge case about 4 ft. 6 in. each way,

W. H. Workman--Demoiselle Cranes
so it was some job getting it through the gate and into position opposite
the door of their temporary run. At last we managed it and out
marched two of the most elegant birds I had ever seen. This species
is one of the smallest of the Cranes and one of the most beautiful.
It is a pale grey colour with the head, neck, and tips of the long wing
and tail plumes deep bluish grey, shading to black. Just behind
the eye, or where the ear should be, there is a bunch on each side
of lovely white feathers which hang down the neck curling back at the
tips. The eyes of these birds are large and brilliant, of a blood-red
colour, and the legs are black. There is no difference in the sexes.
As this Crane is a native of southern Europe, western Asia and
North Africa, it needs a certain amount of shelter during our long and
dismal winter. A good house can be constructed in some corner,
of match boarding covered with felt or rubberoid, and I would strongly
recommend that J in. wire netting be stretched over the bottom
and door so as to keep out rats and mice. On the wire netting put
down a good thick bed of peat moss litter which is healthy, warm,
and will keep clean for months. I made a little yard outside the
house so, if necessary, I can keep the birds shut up say in frost or snow
and at the same time they can get a little exercise. If kept out all
night, except during the warmest summer weather (which we in the
North don't have) they got very stiff legs and quite evidently suffer
from acute rheumatism, so I drive my pair in every night and with
our climate I think this is much the better plan.
Now you will want to know how these birds are fed, but first let
me tell you that though big birds they have extremely small appetites,
in fact a healthy starling would beat them hands down. I feed them
on cracked maize, dari, wheat, and small whole maize with now and then
a little hemp. The best way to feed Cranes is in the morning and evening
in their house: put the food and water in strong earthenware dishes,
those that you buy for a dog, made of brown pottery, very heavy
and measure nearly 6 inches in diameter. I put them on an upturned
box about 6 or 8 inches high so that they cannot put their big
feet into the dishes and dirty the food and water, for in this way they
are rather stupid big things and exceedingly nervous, which makes
them do silly things, but nervous humans often do likewise.

Through the day they consume large quantities of grass, in fact
they graze after the manner of geese, besides which they are bn the
constant hunt for insects great and small. In the morning and evening
they are constantly on the prowl from plant to plant snapping up
innumerable small deer. Then they quarter the ground for small
creepy-crawlies which must be nearly microscopic for I've never been
able to see what they are after, every now and then there is a snap
and another little life is ended. There seems to be only one thing
they like by way of a dainty and that is small bits of household bread,
especially the brown crust. They come to the window for this if hungry
and I have only got to call " Jack and Jill " to bring them up at a run.
If the weather is very hot they go into a small pond for a bathe
much to the detriment of the waterlilies, etc., as they leave a white
film on the water which is just like flour, but after a day it clears
away and the water is all right again, one can't have everything.
With regard to pinioning these birds it is much better to get
a veterinary surgeon to do the work. If properly done there is extremely
little loss of blood and, as far as one can judge, very little pain to the
subject. Just at the tip of the wing you will find a little joint with
a number of flight feathers attached, but on the outside of this joint
you will find a spur with a few feathers only attached. This spur must
be left on as these few feathers give a nice shape to the wing after
pinioning. The best illustration I can think of is the right hand. The
thumb represents the spur and the fingers the flight feathers. You
cut away the fingers at the joint leaving the thumb intact. The vet
should freeze the joint and afterwards apply on a piece of cotton wool
addrinoline and iodine, the former to stop bleeding and the latter
as an antiseptic. If properly done all will be well and you can take
off the bag from the bird's head and let it loose. The bag is of great
use as it covers a very sharp beak which, if left uncovered, would
require most careful watching ; with big birds one must take a little
care. A friend of mine when working with a Bittern forgot to watch
that Bittern's business end and before he knew what had happened
gone was a perfectly good eye. But this was a Bittern and they have
nasty little ways like the Heron tribe.

REVIEW
A GUIDE TO THE BIRDS OF AUSTRALIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991652178571429" page_id="56221916"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
We have been favoured with a copy of Mr. Neville W. Cayley's
book, What Bird is That, which has just appeared in its second edition,
the first apparently having been sold out soon after publication, which
is not surprising seeing what a very excellent book it is and the
ridiculously low price at which it is offered.
Our members are now familiar with Mr. Cayley's work as a bird
artist, and it is greatly owing to his skill as a faithful delineator of birds
that the excellence of his book is due, for it contains a coloured figure
of every one of the many hundreds of birds of Australia. There are
thirty-six coloured plates, each containing between twenty and thirty
figures of birds and each of these is extraordinarily faithful to life
considering the necessarily small size of some of them. These coloured
illustrations render a detailed description of each species unnecessary,
and in fact enable one to identify any particular species much more
readily than any amount of printed matter would do. And the letter-
press is sufficient; a third of a page or so to each species, giving the
trivial and scientific names, derivation of the latter, distribution,
notes on the habits, description of the nests and eggs. There are
293 pages of letterpress and a good index.
This book is primarily intended for the field naturalist and so the
arrangement of the species is not in the orthodox method of classifi-
cation, but, for the most part they are grouped in habitats, such as :
" Birds of the Brushes and Big Scrubs," " Birds of the Open Forest,"
and so on. But although we cannot all go and see these birds in their
wild habitat as most of us would wish we could, there are many of our
members who know many of the Australian birds in life here in our
aviaries, and to all such this excellent book of Mr. Neville Cayley's
will appeal.

I Lave just lost the last of the four Banksian Cockatoos I received
on Sir Charles Lawes-Witterong's death about twenty-three years ago.
" Timmie," as she was called, in spite of her sex, was the least good
specimen of the quartet, but she has had a fairly adventurous career.
For three summers I kept her at liberty and she behaved, on the
whole, with discretion, only once going off on a long exploratory
flight for some days. About four years after I got her she and another
hen caught tuberculosis from a diseased Roseate and were terribly
ill but made most amazing recoveries from that fatal complaint.
Recovery was so complete that many years afterwards " Timmie "
laid and incubated two clutches of eggs, though I could never get her
a satisfactory mate.
Of the other three birds, the fine cock " Teddy " unfortunately
contracted a fatal chill the second autumn I had him. One hen I sent
to Germany as an exchange ; the other strayed in company with
a very wild new cock whose flying powers I underestimated, and was
never heard of again.
I still have a magnificent hen, bought from Mrs. Anningson, which
I believe to have been about forty years in captivity. She lays and
sits not infrequently but so far the eggs have always been infertile,
although her mate is very attentive to her.
I have had further evidence this winter of the great hardiness
of the African Grey Parrot. In the late autumn I was misled by an
imaginative vendor into buying an alleged cock as a mate for Canon
Dutton's old " Polly ". On coming into breeding condition " he "
proved to be a hen, but until I recently gave her away she throve in
a small outdoor aviary with nothing but shelter from direct wind
and wet and no closed shelter at all.

BIRDS OF PARADISE AND BLUE RING-NECKED
PARRAKEETS IN INDIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98264865625" page_id="56221918"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
When in India recently, I visited Mr. Mullick's Marble Palace
in Calcutta, where I saw over a dozen Birds of Paradise, all in tip-top
condition and colour. A good many of these birds live to a ripe old
age, some of them have been with their present owner for over sixteen
years. These birds are fed on bread and milk with a piece of papya
fruit only. It must be the climate that agrees with them so well.
In Europe it is difficult to keep Birds of Paradise in perfect condition
for more than eight or ten years, and very often not so long. The
birds I envied most of all at Mr. Mullick's place were a pair of the blue
variety of the Ring-necked Parrakeets. They were the most beautiful
things I have ever seen, and I wish I had them here to breed some blue
Ring-necks. Alfred Ezra.
A USEFUL FOOD
There is a most useful food on the market which I think
aviculturists are probably not familiar with because I have never
seen it mentioned in any avicultural articles. The food I refer to is
a preparation of maize and beans. The maize, I understand, is partially
steamed or cooked along with the beans and then seems to be rolled
out into very thin irregular wafers and allowed to dry and become quite
crisp. It is beautifully clean and I understand is sold under various
names, such as " Clarendo ", " Feedal," etc. It is extremely light in
weight and a stone takes a large bag and only costs a shilling
for 14 lb.
I use this food in various ways, for instance, during hard weather
I mix a little dry with the wheat, etc. for the fancy ducks and give
it to them on their floating tray. They love it and it does them no harm
as a treat. The Demoiselle and Crowned Cranes get it mixed with their
ordinary seeds and they seem very fond of it, a friend feeds his Crowned
Cranes on nothing else ; by the way, can any member get Cranes to
eat animal food during the winter when live food is scarce ? I have
tried cooked and raw meat without success, bread broken small they
like in small quantities. I find my Trumpeters exceedingly fond of this

prepared maize and beans and they get it mixed with their other seeds,
which, of course, is in addition to their soft food. Some of our members
who keep Waders I am sure are sometimes hard put to to make a variety
for these delightful birds. I have found this maize excellent for this
purpose, I mix it up with coarse biscuit meal, a little rice or mashed
potatoes and add crissel or raw heart chopped up, then scald the
mixture with boiling water. (If using raw heart scald before adding
this.).
I would here like to make a suggestion ; that is : that writers telling
us about the various rare birds that they procure from time to time
should make a point of telling us in every case exactly how they feed
these birds for we often get most interesting descriptions of rare
acquisitions, but never a word as to how they are fed. I find I use the
back volumes of our Magazine more for this than any other purpose.

to get for them while I am here I should be very glad to do so. I shall
be here two, or perhaps three years, and would like to be of help to

In my opinion large aviaries are necessary for Masked Lovebirds,
and they need plenty of green food. Movable aviaries are excellent
for Lovebirds, as these always have plenty of grass. In small aviaries
with no turf the young are often half-naked when they leave the nest.

VIOLET-EARED WAXBILL BRED IN GERMANY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8889984" page_id="56221920"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
I read in a German periodical that the Violet-eared Waxbill
(Granatina granatina ) was successfully bred in Germany last year.
I think it is the first time that this species has successfully reared its
young in any aviary.

EYE DISEASE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99801104" page_id="56221920"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
I thank Mr. Boosey for his reply to my query re the eye disease
in Parrakeets, and for his description as quoted from Lord Tavistock.
Unfortunately I am not as a rule interested in Parrakeets, therefore
have not the book to hand from which Mr. Boosey quotes, but the
symptoms quoted are identical with those that have come under my
care, and there is not much room to doubt that it is the one and same
disease. This disease is caused by a deficiency of (fat soluble) Vitamin A.
Whilst most cases investigated have been in Softbills, I have had many
instances in Hardbills, and also in English-bred Quail; all have been
effectively cured by the same treatment, viz. the application of
Vitamin A given direct in the beak. Complete cures are effected in
from forty-eight hours to seven days, according to the condition of the
bird. I am rather interested in this disease where Parrakeets are
concerned as I should like to ascertain for sure if it is one and the same
disease and, should any of our members have a bird suffering with it,
with the symptoms as described by Lord Tavistock, I should like to
have the bird for an experiment, with a view to effecting a cure.
It was interesting to learn from Dr. Hamilton of the eye disease
in the wild state. Unfortunately he does not describe the symptoms
fully, but I should not be surprised to find that this is the same disease
also. I come to this conclusion because of his mentioning of the
climatic conditions of the district for several years and the failure of
the farmers to grow their crops. Young shoots of grain, leaves, etc.,
and the food of these birds in the natural surroundings naturally
contain fat soluble substances, and it is probable that the birds were

suffering from the deficiency accordingly. This belief is strengthened
by the fact that some of the birds recovered in captivity.
In the case of those described where the eye receded, this is, in my
opinion, a different disease altogether, for whereas I have effected a cure
in the first-mentioned, in the latter I have been unable to, even with
a balanced diet containing the three essential Vitamins A, B, and C.
I have in my possession now a Canary from a well-known breeder with
this complaint. There is certainly a slight improvement in the eye,
but I am rather doubtful if it can be cured by feeding. Time will tell,
as I am still treating the bird, although I have had it about four weeks.
Regarding the query of W. L. English in the March issue as to
whether we can improve the health of delicate Softbills by feeding
Mealworms with Vitamin-rich substances : we could of course improve
the feeding value of these by vitamin feeding, but the result would be
in the minority as it were. Mealworms do not form the staple diet of
Softbills in captivity, therefore the extra food value in them would not
be of much use to the birds. What must be done is that the staple diet
must be balanced with the essential vitamin substances, then success
would be obtained. It may be of interest to Softbill keepers to know
that if they use a dry stock mixture, or a mixture that has to be
moistened with water, that they are supplying their birds with a food
that fails to supply the essential vitamin substances necessary for
health and longevity, because it is practically impossible for a dry
mixture to contain them.
Whilst on this subject, I have just received a letter from a prominent
doctor member of ours, explaining that he has had many birds with
the eye disease, and in the case of young Blue Robins he has been
troubled with Avian Polyneuritis. For the benefit of any fanciers
who have been troubled with the latter disease, it may interest them
to know that it is due to a deficiency of Vitamin B, or water soluble B,
which is a most essential substance because, unlike the fat soluble
substances it cannot be stored in the body tissues, therefore it is more
quickly apparent and death, incidentally, quicker.
P. H. Hastings.

mentioned in my article on Gouldian Finches (page 90). As can
be seen, the small shallow receptacles keep almost entirely free from
husks. The birds stand on the small platform to shell the seeds, and
the husks and any dropped seeds fall into the box below. This method
works very satisfactorily and keeps the aviary wonderfully clean of
seed-husks. The box itself is about five inches deep and long enough
to take as many bottles as are necessary. My hoppers contain white
millet, red millet, Canary-seed, niger-seed, and another Canary-seed.
Indian millet is usually given in the form of spray millet. When
cleaning the box out the husks, etc., can be emptied into a sieve, and
the husks blown away.

Situated within twenty miles of London, within a short distance
of the main Portsmouth road, Foxwarren Park is not only a most
beautiful spot but it is ideal for the realization of its owner's ambition,
to form a wonderful collection of living birds and mammals. The soil
is sandy loam, the ground beloved of pine-trees and, however
persistently the rain descends, the ground is dry a few hours later.
It has been a home of foreign birds for many years, for a former owner
kept Parrots which he allowed to fly loose.
The present collection is magnificent ranging from Sunbirds to
deer, and including the rarest and most beautiful foreign birds that
have ever been brought alive to this country.
The outdoor aviaries are very extensive and situated in a lovely
spot sheltered by a larch wood and yet catching every gleam of sun
that shines. They are not elaborate aviaries, but they certainly could
not serve their purpose better than they do. Wooden shelters, built
of double boarding, each compartment some 10 or 12 feet square,
lighted by skylights and front windows which open out into flights
which are turfed and planted with shrubs. These flights are not too
large, but they in their turn open out into very large flights where there
are plenty of bushes, long grass, and ponds, an ideal arrangement
because the birds can always return to their warmed house if the weather

becomes cold. The outside flights, instead of being formed on an
iron or ordinary timber framework, are of larch poles which gives
a rustic appearance and answers the purpose admirably.
The population of these aviaries, of which there are two ranges,
each consisting of eight separate aviaries opening into two very
large outer flights, is very large and contains very many rarities such
as Madagascar Partridges, Renault's Ground Cuckoos, Blacksmith,
White-winged, South African Wattled and Australian Black-breasted
Plovers, Fairy Bluebirds, Sun Bitterns, Japanese Jays, Crowned
Pigeons, and a host of others, not forgetting a South African Bee-eater
which has lived there for six years and is still going strong.
A range of twenty-three smaller aviaries each designed for a single
pair of birds where they may be undisturbed for breeding, and here one
finds the rare Starlings such as Rothschild's Grackle and the Crowned
Starling, both of which bred successfully last year for the first time.
These aviaries consist of shelters and wired flights, and there is an
excellent arrangement for feeding from the back through a small
trap-door without entering the aviary.
Then there is the range of Parrakeet aviaries where the Queen
Alexandra Parrakeets bred so successfully last year and the hen is
sitting now. Malabars are also nesting, and the wonderful Blue
Alexandrine and many of his progeny, Lutino Ringnecks, Derbians,
and a splendid pair of Hooded Parrakeets may be seen.
The Bird Room, near the house, contains a number of rare Birds
of Paradise, rare Woodpeckers, Amethyst Starlings, and many other
rare birds which are kept in special large cages.
In the garden itself is a flock of Demoiselle Cranes which come right
up to the house to be fed, when they are generally accompanied by a
pair or two of full-winged Chukar Partridges and some of the numerous
Indian Spotted Turtle-Doves that are at large in the grounds.
Looking to the West from the house one gets a beautiful view away
to the valley of the Wey, which appears as a silver streak in the distance,
while in the foreground are seen Cranes, deer, wallabies, and Pheasants,
which are enclosed in a space of some fifty acres including wooded
hills, scrub, and gorse on the high ground, which falls away to grass-
land, on which are herds of deer and antelopes and flocks of Cranes.

This enclosure is surrounded by a fox-proof fence which, where it passes
the garden, is completely hidden by passing along a cutting, an ideal
arrangement allowing an unobstructed view from the house and garden.
This enclosure is a very beautiful and most interesting place in
which all of the mammals and birds have done remarkably well.
Wallabies have increased greatly in numbers, and at the present time
every female has a large " Joey " in her pouch if it has not already
left this. Spotted deer and hog deer have increased from three or
four to a herd, and the same may be said of blackbuck. Amongst
quite a large flock of Sarus Cranes are some with full powers of
flight, and to see these sailing down the valley in full flight is a
wonderful sight.
Chukar Partridges are all over the place, both inside and outside
the enclosure, all now paired and nesting. It is strange that this
species appears to be always tame and will merely move out of one's
way with a protesting and almost hostile gesture. There are Pheasants
here too, three hen Monauls are either sitting or conducting their
chicks through the undergrowth while their husbands have had to
be confined on account of their murderous tendencies towards other
kinds of pheasants. Junglefowl, both Red and Grey, inhabit the woods,
both inside and outside the fence.
One descends from the high ground, passing plantations of small
birches, clumps of gorse and bracken, beneath pine trees and oaks,
stopping on the way to admire the wallabies with their heavily-laden
pouches, or startled at the sudden springing up of a Chinese water
deer, of which there are many in the enclosure, which will lie until
nearly trodden upon, and then dash off like huge hares. We come to
the Waterfowl ponds, which have been cleverly formed from a stream
supplied by a ram which ensures a continuous supply of fresh water.
Like the rest of the collection, the Waterfowl are of many kinds, and
some very rare. The Pink-headed Duck, to be seen nowhere else in
Europe, is represented here by several males with brilliant pink heads
and blackish bodies, and one female. There is quite a little flock of
Cotton Teal, most difficult to import but thriving at Foxwarren.
Mandarins are really establishing themselves, several full-winged birds
breeding in barrels fastened in the trees from which the ducklings

tumble to the ground without sustaining the slightest injury. Amongst
the rare Ducks may be seen the Hottentot Teal and the strange -
looking White-backed Duck of South Africa and Madagascar which
hatched young last year.
There are rare Geese, too. A lovely pair of Emperor Geese, the very
attractive Orinoco Goose, and Blue and White Snow Geese, while in
an inner enclosure in the wooded part of this large naturalist's paradise
Australian Brush Turkeys are busy with their mound.
Such is a brief and very inadequate description of this wonderful
Park to which, by the kind invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Ezra, the members
of the Avicultural Society paid one of a series of much-appreciated
annual visits on 28th May.

By Dr. E. Hopkinson, C.M.G., etc.
When Records of Breeding in Captivity was published in 1926,
I knew nothing of any record for this bird, but I now find that its
omission was a result of ignorance, for in its native country it has
been bred in captivity for several years previously, first by
Mr. Bedchambers, and later by Mr. Downer.
On a recent visit to Australia I had the pleasure of meeting the
last-named, an old resident and a great exponent of sport in all forms,
shooting, racing, polo, etc., and a great authority on everything to do
with Australia's fauna. He took me out to his delightful house in the
suburbs of Adelaide, and there I saw the breeding Mallee Fowl.
They inhabited one of a pair of pens (the other contained Brush
Turkeys) measuring about 15 by 4 yards. The stock consisted of
a pair of old birds and five young of varying ages. The mound from
which they came occupied one end of the enclosure, and as the owner
thought that another young bird was overdue to appear, he made my
visit an occasion for digging into the mound, and there sure enough
was a fully feathered young bird about 6 inches down, which had
evidently died in its struggle to reach the surface.

They have been breeding in this way for a good many years, and
such breeding seems to offer the best chances of survival for this and
so many other Australian birds and beasts whose existence changed
.conditions and civilization are threatening so ominously.
For a good account of the experiment, I cannot do better than
quote an article from the Advertiser (Adelaide) of 2nd February, 1932,
contributed by Mr. Downer M
" Mallee Fowl are being fast exterminated by foxes and iguanas.
This is much to be regretted, and every assistance and support should
be given to the family of the late Mr. Bell chambers to carry on the
good work which he started in breeding these birds at Humbug Scrub.
The Mallee Fowl digs a hole in the ground and builds a huge mound
of dirt, leaves, and sticks. Leaves are scratched into the bottom of
the mound, which is opened, mostly by the cock bird. The hen lays
an. egg; which the cock sets and covers with leaves, sand, sticks, and
stones. The decaying leaves generate sufficient heat to hatch the egg,
and the young bird makes its way unassisted out of the mound. When
it reaches the top of the mound it is feathered, can fly, and is independent
of its parents. The old birds appear to take no notice of their young.
This dry summer has been ideal for my pair of birds. Strange to say,
two young birds came out on the same day, a third five days later, the
fourth five days later, and the fifth three days later, and I am expecting
more shortly. The birds can tell by the nose and beak whether the
temperature is right, and they open and close the nest according to
requirements. Bellchambers said that these strange birds never
drink in their native state, but do so occasionally in captivity. Who
wants to be a Mallee Fowl ? I have kept these birds for about fifteen
years, and the only time I have ever seen them take water was the
other day, when one of the young ones took three drops. It is not
known how many eggs a Mallee Fowl will lay. I have seen sixteen in
one mound in three tiers, but whether more than one hen used the
nest I do not know.
" Frank H. Downer. 55
Many other Australian birds inhabit the garden and adjoining
paddock, two of the Plover, various Ducks, etc., and a few aviaries
house smaller birds, but the Mallee Fowl naturally have pride of place.

Rheinart's Pheasant (Rheinardia ocellata) was for a number of
years known only from a single tail-feather reposing in the Paris
Museum. Later specimens were collected in Annam. To Mr. Delacour
belongs the credit of introducing the living bird to Europe. He has
spent many months in French Indo-China, and has heard the call of
this fine bird in the densely wooded mountain slopes, but he has never
seen the bird wild, and it is doubtful whether anyone else has done
so, for it lives in the densest jungle which is well-nigh impenetrable to
a human being, and the only way of securing it is by means of nooses
set in its runs, a method of trapping at which the natives are very
skilful.
It is not a gaily-coloured bird by any means, its chief colours being
dull browns and greys of various shades, the plumage spotted throughout
with white spots, like a Guineafowl. The cock has a wonderful tail,
the feathers being of great length and breadth, and spotted with
chestnut as well as white. A crest decorates the back of the head,
but as a rule this hangs as a few inconspicuous, dark, hair-like feathers,
while similar feathers grow from the cheeks.
These forest Pheasants are not fond of the sun, and if one wishes
to witness a display by the cock to the hen, a gloomy morning in April
or May must be selected. It was on such a morning that I first saw
the cock Rheinart's Pheasant display. From a considerable distance
I noticed a conspicuous white object nearly the size of a tennis ball
moving about in the enclosure. It was too dull to distinctly see the
bird itself, but this white object was clearly visible. As I came nearer
I noticed that the appearance of the cock bird was completely altered
by the presence of what looked like a large, white powder-puff on the
top of his head. From beneath the ordinarily visible and inconspicuous
crest had appeared this snowy white tuft of the finest down-like plumes
while his cheek plumes were thrown forward.
Apart from this extraordinary head ornament the actual display
was not nearly so striking as that of the Argus Pheasant with his
wonderfully decorated and overgrown secondary wing feathers. The
bird runs round the hen with his very broad tail made even broader

SOME BIRDS IN EGYPT AND PALESTINE

By Captain John S. Beeve
During a visit to Egypt and Jerusalem, I made notes of the birds
I saw. Since my return I went to see our Editor, who surprised me by
asking me to write an article on the subject.
Well, I went to see temples, tombs, mosques, holy places, etc., but
never dreamt of writing an article on birds ! I wished, however, when
I had returned and began to make up a systematic list, that I had
taken a little more trouble by jotting down dates, places, etc. more
carefully, and should I ever do such another trip, I should certainly
make my notes in a systematic manner.
Egypt, its temples, mosques, etc., is well worth seeing, but my
wife and I agreed that Palestine was the more fascinating and that we
should like to return there for a month on the first opportunity.
I am strongly of the opinion that all believers in the Old or New
Testament who can do so, should take the earliest opportunity in their
career of visiting the Holy Land.
I trust that as a somewhat amateur ornithologist I shall not display
too great ignorance ! The only information re dates I can give, is to
say that I was in Cairo from 16th December to 6th February (except
llth-13th January in the Fayoum, 19th-26th January up the Nile,
26th January to 1st February at Assouan). It must be borne in mind
that many of the notes were made from car, boat, train, donkey-back,
etc., and that on many occasions in Egypt being with other travellers
it was impossible to stop or spend much time on identification, that both
countries were entirely new to me, and that my one source of reference
was Nicoll's Birds of Egypt. I believe no book has been published on
the birds of Palestine. What a delightful job for some young man !
I conceive, however, that it would entail some long and arduous work,

and one is still liable to fall among thieves, and that not only between
Jerusalem and Jericho ! The main roads, since the British occupa-
tion, are as good as any in England, and the hotels in Jerusalem are
up-to-date, this by the way.
I have not put scientific names as where cases of sub-species arise
owing to circumstances I could not guarantee them, and it is obvious
that in the commoner species, such as Black Kite, Hoodie, and House
Sparrow, they were the Egyptian forms.
" Up the Nile valley 55 means somewhere between Cairo and
Assouan !
Dealing first with the Egyptian birds, I saw a pair of Brown-necked
Ravens, in the Wady Hof (near Helouan). Hooded Crows were very
common in Cairo, the Fayoum, and elsewhere. Starlings I only saw
at Chakchouk (Fayoum) ; most noticeable about these birds was the
large white spots all over the breast. I believe that only in the first
year do birds here have any white points to the breast feathers,
but in the Fayoum birds they were so striking for their size and
whiteness, and they surely could not all have been young birds.
Nicoll states that Poltaratsky's Starling is common in the Fayoum,
but he does not mention this as a distinctive mark ; can any reader
throw some light on this point ?
I saw two or three Trumpeter Bullfinches on Tutankhamen's tomb.
House Sparrows were everywhere abundant. Crested Larks (Galerita
cristata maculata Nicoll) were at Chakchouk and Assouan.
The White Wagtail was common at Chakchouk and elsewhere;
I got within a few yards of a dozen or more on the edge of the desert
at Heliopolis, but they were also in the streets, on the outskirts. I saw
one Pipit (Meadow ?) at Lake Karoun, Chakchouk.
In the Assouan public garden near the Cataract Hotel, I saw a pair
of Nile Valley Sunbirds and White-vented Bulbuls were to be seen
in the gardens at Heliopolis and at Chakchouk, where the Chiffchaff was
also very common, as also at Assouan. The only other Warbler I saw
was unknown to me; it was skulking on or near the ground in a private
garden at Heliopolis. I thought it might be the Sardinian or Graceful.
Two or three Song Thrushes were in the same garden, and a Blue
Rock Thrush (Western form) I saw at the Great Pyramid, and another

in the Valley of the Kings, Luxor. One Mourning Chat was on
Tutankhamen's tomb, and one near the Assouan Keservoir.
When motoring through the desert on the Pyramids-Fayoum
road, I saw another Chat which might have been the above or Finsch's
Chat. Not being familiar with these Chats or able to handle them,
I found them very difficult. Nicoll gives twelve (Enanthe as occurring
in Egypt, Palestine, etc., the majority of which might be difficult
to distinguish from each other in the field.
I only saw one Stonechat, at Chakchouk, and one or two pairs of
Black Redstarts were about the Heliopolis gardens on the edge of
the desert.
A few Bluethroats ( occidentalis ) were at Chakchouk, very Robin-
like in their movements.
Swallows (Egyptian form-- Savignii) were near Cairo, at Chakchouk,
etc., and the little Crag Martins at Sakhara Pyramids and up the Nile.
A flock of Swifts (Egyptian form-- Pallidus) were over the Citadel
at Cairo, some at Chakchouk, and were seen south of Cairo to Assouan.
The Little Green Bee-eater was plentiful at Chakchouk, and appeared
to be so in all suitable places from Cairo to Assouan.
Hoopoes were common everywhere, including Heliopolis and the
Cairo Zoological Gardens. At the former I saw one and a Kite sitting
on either side of a dome above the main street. Curiously enough
I never saw one of these birds with crest erected. The Pied Kingfisher
was everywhere on water, from the Delta to Assouan inclusive ; it
was very pretty to see these birds hovering like a Kestrel, but with
head bent down between the outstretched wings at right angles to
the body. Not having seen Nicoll's statement (p. 337) till afterwards,
I unfortunately did not note the nearest station to which I saw a
European Kingfisher from the train window ; I estimated it was about
seventy miles south of Beni Suef !
At Chakchouk one could get quite close to the Lark-heeled Cuckoo
as they skulked in the foliage of Palms, etc. ; a good plate of this bird
is given in Nicoll. I saw two or three Rose-ringed Parrakeets flying
about in Cairo Zoological Gardens (see Nicoll, p. 347).
A Little Owl was in a palm grove on the west side of the Nile, south
of Helouan and one in Luxor temple and I heard one in the temple of

Seti and Rameses at Abydos. I imagine they are general in all suitable
localities. Kestrels were everywhere ; I watched one sitting for some
time on a balcony of the Heliopolis Palace Hotel. I saw two or three
Harriers up the Nile valley, but could not identify them, but Russell
Pasha told me he thought they were probably the Pallid. While
motoring near Chakchouk I saw a Harrier-like bird of a grey colour,
like a Chanting Hawk I shot in Cape Colony in 1902 ; it was skimming
low over the ground in broad daylight, but I put it down as being
possibly a Sooty Falcon.
Of Sparrow Hawks I only saw one at Heliopolis and one at the
Sacred Lake, Karnak.
Black Kites were nearly everywhere, and you can scarcely look up
in Cairo without seeing several in the air. I was told that they
constantly swoop down and pick up golf balls, and the Grenadier
officers told me the men's dinners had to be covered up when carried
from the cook-house as these birds swooped and picked meat off the
dishes. One officer then stated he had seen one pick up a polo ball,
which statement was immediately entered in the officers' battalion
lie-book ! At one place where our Nile steamer was moored, thirty or
forty continually hovered round, flying quite close to one, and picking
the refuse out of the water with their claws ; they then ate it on the
wing, lifting the claw to meet the beak. Since seeing this I am of
opinion that the above "lie " should probably be erased !
I noticed one tidying up a nest in the afore-mentioned gardens
at Assouan on 31st January, and another carrying a long
stick in Cairo on 2nd February. Between Baliana and Abydos
was the only one I saw of those beautiful birds, the Black-winged
Kite ; in the brilliant sun it looked almost pure white, except for the
black on the wings, and its shape in flight reminded me of a Peregrine.
Two or three Egyptian Vultures were on a Nile sandbank near
Guerga with Griffons of which there were six or seven, and at Assouan
I watched a pair of the latter circling high above me over the Cataract.
At one place on the Nile I saw one or two White Storks.
Buff-backed Herons were everywhere from the delta to Assouan
(inclusive). The " Paddy-birds " were on all cultivation close to the
fellaheen at work, and to the roadsides. I never picked out any Little

Egrets among these birds, and I feel convinced the vast majority were
Buff-backed, but at this time of year I could see no buff, even on the
head, they appeared quite white.
The only three or four Little Egrets I saw were in a canal between
Baliana and Abydos. On the bank of the Nile just north of Komombo,
I observed a pair of Geese, which from their size I believe were Egyptian.
They were some way from our steamer, and I think were too large for
Buddy Shellduck.
I went out shooting one morning with Bussell Pasha, on some
water at Ezbet, near Cairo, where we saw Mallard, Pintail, Pochard,
and Teal, which last I also saw on the Sacred Lake at Karnak. A
White-eyed Pochard killed near Tel-el-Kebir was shown to me, and
I also saw two or three of these birds on the Sacred Lake.
A Marbled Teal and a Stiff-tailed Duck killed near Cairo, were sent
me by Bussell Pasha who asked the Zoo to skin them for me.
Our first morning in the Fayoum my wife and I were out on Lake
Karoun before sunrise, and were rowed into a somewhat inefficient
" hide " made of palm branches stuck in the bottom of the lake ;
just at dawn the Duck came in from a southerly direction and great
portions of the lake became smothered with them, and they appeared
to be about half Shoveller and half Tufted, and I could see no other
species of Duck. Just before dusk they could be seen clearing off in
the direction whence they came.
I saw one or two Cormorant on the Nile near Awfad Guebara.
I believe that I saw about three flocks of White Pelicans on the Nile
sandbanks ; from their shape I could not see what else they could be,
but it was most difficult to identify birds on these sandbanks ; in
many places the river must be quite a mile wide, and naturally the
steamer is always on the far side from the sandbanks. It is often very
shallow in the deepest part, and it is no uncommon thing for the steamer
to get stuck in these shallow reaches; two of the crew stand on either
side of the bows with long poles and continually feel the bottom, and
shout up to the bridge the depth as they go along.
The glare of the sun also was most extraordinary, birds looking
quite a different colour after one had passed them. With the flocks of
Pelican were always some tall birds which looked like Herons or may

have been the common Grey Crane. I was informed by the Swiss who
kept the shooting lodge where we stayed at Chakchouk on Lake Karoun
that a flock of Flamingos and Pelicans were on the lake last November,
for six weeks. At Chakchouk I handled a Rock Pigeon which had
been shot; the rump was a very light grey. Palm Doves were common
from Cairo to Assouan, and in the Fayoum ; they were always in the
Hotel and other gardens.
I took a small flock of birds on some rough ground near the Temple
of Denderah to be Stone Curlew ; they got up and skimmed over the
hillocks and I tried to find them again, but for fear of losing my party
going into the Temple I failed to do so. Ringed Plover at Lake Karoun,
and in a canal near Luxor, I could never get near enough to say if they
were this species or the Little Ringed, or Kitlitz Plover. Some I saw
at Ezbet near Cairo, Russell Pasha told me he thought were Kitlitz.
Odd Green Plover were seen up the Nile valley and in the Fayoum,
and the handsome Spur-winged Plover was common in the latter,
where I could easily have shot some, and a saw a few up the Nile.
I heard Redshank at Ezbet, and saw several at Lake Karoun where
I shot three.
A few Green Sandpiper got up singly out of the ditches in the
Fayoum and up the Nile valley.
Black-tailed Godwit were seen on the wing at Ezbet, and Common
Snipe were shot there.
A flock of Gulls on Lake Karoun I could not identify, but from
studying Nicoll thought they might be the Great Black-headed. I saw
a Moorhen or two on a village pond near Cairo and Coot were numerous
at Ezbet, several on Lake Karoun and a few on the Sacred Lake
Karnak.
Palestine
As our train climbed up to Jerusalem on the pouring wet morning
of Sunday, 7th February, a good covey of Partridges got up from
close to the line, and I presume they can only have been Chukar ;
on the following morning they were snow-balling in the streets of
Jerusalem ! The Corvidae are well represented in Palestine ; I saw
Raven, Brown-necked and Fan-tailed Raven, and Hooded Crows ;

Captain John S. Reeve--Some Birds in Egypt and Palestine 129
the first I took to be C. corax by their note as they were circling above
the Valley of Hinnom which I may mention runs on the south end of
the city of Jerusalem ; the higher up of the two kept diving down with
closed wings as Rooks sometimes do in stormy weather, and I wondered
whether this was some form of display by the male, it being near
breeding time ? Across this valley towards the Mount of Olives on the
east side could be seen Ravens of one species or another wending their
way by ones and twos each evening an hour or two before sunset.
I saw one Brown-necked on the Jericho road and I believe one Fan-
tailed sitting on the city wall near the Dung Gate, but several of these
last flew across the north end of the Dead Sea as I was talking to Major
Tullock (in charge of the Concession works there) ; very interesting
to see the potash and bromide which is being obtained in large quantities
but this must not be written of here !
It is interesting to note that in The Ibis of 1865, Tristram states
that Jackdaws were common at Jerusalem and Shechem and that
numbers resorted to the Dome of the Rock (in the Temple area).
I thought I saw one just outside the south wall of the city, but it
popped round a corner so quickly that I could not swear to it; at
any rate I saw no other in the eleven days I was in Palestine ; Luke
and Keith-Roach in the list of birds in their Handbook of Palestine
and Trans-Jordan give the Jackdaw as a common winter visitor
and locally resident.
In Tristram's notes in 1859, he says the Egyptian Vulture was
universally abundant and bred in great numbers in the Valley of the
Kedron and that the Griffon was common in the Judaean hills and
between Jerusalem and Jericho. The only Vultures I saw were a
long way off between Engannim and Shechem and I should say they
were a pair of Griffons ; as we left on 18th February, it is natural
that we saw no Egyptian as they do not arrive till the end of the
month ; it is interesting to note that at the time Tristram wrote
there was hardly a single house outside the city walls ; now there
is a large modern town with large hotels, 'buses, motors, etc. ; if
the Egyptian Vulture nests in the Kedron Valley it is probably some
way down from Jerusalem and the village of Siloam. I saw Great
Tits at the Garden Tomb and elsewhere. Greenfinches, Chaffinches,

130 Captain John S. Beeve--Some Birds in Egypt and Palestine
and Goldfinches seemed common about Jerusalem, and the House
Sparrow was also at the Concession works and therefore doubtless
in Jericho too.
The White Wagtail was common at Jerusalem and elsewhere,
and I saw one Grey Wagtail in the Valley of Jehoshaphat ; I saw a
few Chiffchaffs at Jerusalem ; a Palestine Bulbul flew past on the
Jerusalem-Lydda road after leaving the hill country ; two or three
Blackbirds and Thrushes and a Black Redstart were among some
olive-trees on the outskirts of Jerusalem (beyond the Pool of Gihon),
and I saw one other of the last-named on Zacharias' tomb in theValley
of Jehoshaphat. One or two Mourning Chats (or Pied Wheatear,
0. lugens) were seen, a Fisch's or Arabian Chat on the Jerusalem-
Lydda road and a Stonechat between Shechem and Engannim.
A Little Owl was sitting on the excavations of the Jebusite city of
Jericho and did not appear as though even Joshua would have made
him stir ! I saw another on the road to Nazareth and heard one in
the Valley of Hinnom. Kestrels seemed plentiful on the Plain of
Esdraelon and in other places, but I was puzzled over some Hawks
near Shechem and about six others were circling like Kites over
Engannim (modern Jenin) ; I was some way from them but they
resembled Kestrels in size but not in behaviour ; is it possible they
were Lesser Kestrels which I believe are usually in colonies ? Tristram
in 1859 stated that they were gregarious about ruins in the Plain
district, there being fifteen or twenty pairs at Ramleh (near Lydda).
I only saw one Black Kite, and it was on a telegraph pole near
Engannim.
I saw a pair of Stock Doves (I forget where !) and a pair of Bock
Doves on the road outside Jericho. Green Plover were about Dothan
and the Plain of Philistia.
In all I am of opinion that I identified only twenty-eight species in
the eleven days I was in Palestine, whereas while in the Fayoum for
two nights I got twenty-six certain and three or four others doubtful,
and in Egypt altogether about sixty. I don't know if there are
100 Palestinian residents whereas there are over 300 on the list,
Palestine being situated in the centre of one of the great migration
routes, and only in December and January is there no migration taking

By Geoffrey H. Clark
This pheasant, which has from time to time appeared in British
coverts during the last few years, has excited the interest of sportsmen
and ornithologists alike, and there has been much speculation as to
whence it has come. For some time it was put down as a sport, nothing
more or less, to be classed on a par with black and wild rabbits and
albino Pheasants. This theory held until it was found by catching
and penning the birds that they bred chicks that grew up like the
parents, and unlike a true freak did not throw back to the immediate
ancestors. The opinion was then held that the bird must be a local
sub-species, whose colouring was governed by the conditions under
which it lived, and even more likely, by the food which it ate. But
if this were so, why was it still possible to find Colchicus, Torquatus ,
and Mongolicus in the same coverts as those in which the Melanistic
had made its appearance ? To add to the general confusion it was
found out that birds of precisely similar appearance to those found
in English coverts were turning up in other parts of the world. This
definitely refuted the idea of a local sub-species, for by no stretch of
the imagination could similar conditions be said to exist in Asia Minor,
whence the birds were reported, and Kent. I mention Kent specifically,
because a friend of mine who owns a few acres of shooting near the
Bomney Marshes tells me that this last season he encountered some of
" the new black Pheasants ", and because in 1930, I was shooting a
covert near Biddenden, and one of the party shot an unusually dark
hen. I have always regretted that I did not pay more attention to
this bird, but when I gave my opinion as to its possible identity, the
remark was greeted with sceptical smiles, and I let the matter drop.

132 Geoffrey H. Clark--The Melanistic Mutant Pheasant
I was more or less given to understand that the bird was nothing
more than a dark sport not to be dignified with such a highfalutin
name as Melanistic Mutant.
Two cardinal facts stand out about the bird, namely : That it breeds
true to its type and that it made a simultaneous appearance in more
than one part of the world at once. Now a local variation may breed
true to its type given that conditions remain the same year after year,
but in no circumstances does a local variation turn up in such widely
separated places as those mentioned. This seems to show that it is
not a sport or it would revert to its nearer ancestors, and that it is not
a local variation or it would not show in several places. We are, then,
faced with the problem, what is it ? The answer is, I think, that it is
a complete reversal to the old original form of Pheasant from which
all known modern varieties have sprung.
This is a very sweeping statement I know, but I will endeavour to
prove it to the best of my abilities. The first point is that Melanistic
Mutant blood is far stronger than that of any of the ordinary covert
breeds. In all crossings it is the Melanistic blood that predominates.
This seems to indicate that there is something very special about it,
for it seems unlikely that the blood of a sport or local variation would
triumph over that of Colchicus or any other firmly established breed.
This brings us to the question : If the Melanistic Mutant be the old
original Pheasant, what then are Colchicus, Torquatus, and such
breeds ? These, I think, are the local variations. It is generally
accepted that a local sub-species will continue to breed true to its
type as long as conditions similar to those which evolved the type
continue, and as long as it is not swamped out with foreign blood.
When I was very young, I learned chemistry at school. Very little
knowledge was thus inculcated into me as I spent most of the period
in making surreptitious stinks under cover of a bench, but a little has
remained. I remember that if a piece of metal is treated in a certain
way, the exact treatment eludes me, it gives off a noisome smell and
becomes a salt of that particular metal. If this salt is then subjected
to another treatment it turns back to the original metal once more.
It is my opinion that something similar has happened to the Pheasant.
I do not, of course, intend that this parallel be taken scientifically, but
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.991726" page_id="56221955"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
Geoffrey H. Clark--The Melanistic Mutant Pheasant 133
merely as a verbal simile to illustrate my point. Just as the first
process evolved a salt from the metal, so did something happen in
the life of the original Pheasant that caused all these " pure bred
sports ", to coin a phrase for them, to be thrown forth. Perhaps some
vast migratory movement, such as occurs from time to time in the
history of a bird, occurred, which caused numbers of Pheasants to
leave their original birthplace, wherever that might have been, and
far forth to those places in which we now find them. Changed conditions
in their new habitats involved radical changes, not only in the habits
but in the appearances of the birds. Possibly the infusion of a little
alien blood intensified these changes, and thus we get the various
species of Phasianus and allied genera that we know to-day. Now we
come to the process which the salt of the metal underwent in my simile.
And this, reverting once more to Pheasant parlance, is the promiscuous
interbreeding that goes on to-day among wild birds. Even as the
original metal was brought back by certain things being done to the
salt, so was the original Pheasant brought back by the process of
interbreeding.
All over the world sportsmen are importing Pheasants to augment
their native stock if such a thing exists. In England there is no native
stock, but for purposes of argument it may be assumed that Colchicus
comprises our native bird as it is the oldest established by far. It is
comparatively of recent times that Torquatus and Mongolicus have been
introduced. The bird resulting from interbreeding between these three
is said to be a better bird from the sportsman's point of view, but from
the point of view of purity of blood it is sadly deteriorated. Up to a
certain point the most powerful strain would predominate. This is
proved by the way the Yersicolour and certain fancy strains were quickly
eliminated by the more vigorous nature of the three main birds.
Sooner or later, however, there would come a time when this triple
interbreeding would get the blood into such a tangle that there was no
saying which strain predominated. In such a case, we can imagine
the embryo, utterly at a loss as to which strain to take after, cutting
the Gordian knot by reverting right back to the original type. To
endow the embryo with sufficient intellectual qualities as to induce
perplexity, is, of course, rather infantile, but such a method of speaking

134 Geoffrey H. Clark--The Melanistic Mutant Pheasant
can illustrate my point more clearly than any other. I admit that this
is largely in the nature of conjecture, but unless the propagation of the
Melanistic Mutant is entirely fortuitous, and facts seem against this,
there can be no other explanation.
There is one last suggestion I have to make. It is generally agreed
that in its wild state the Pheasant is monogamous, or perhaps I ought
to say, is by nature monogamous, for in many places it is forced into
polygamy. But of recent times, within a few thousand years, it had
abandoned the path of virtue and now the cock likes to keep a harem.
This being the case it is necessary that more cocks should be killed
than hens to preserve the balance of the species. Nature has, therefore,
equipped the cock bird with a very eye-taking uniform so that it will
be more conspicuous to those creatures that prey on it than the dowdy
hen. The livery of the Melanistic cock, however, although undoubtedly
handsome, is not nearly so conspicuous as that of, say, Torquatus or
Colchicus. Its greens and greys harmonize excellently with the reeds
amongst which it lived in its first incarnation, with the result that the
sexes would be killed by vermin in about equal proportions. Does this
not seem to point to yet another reversal to the conditions prevailing
in the days of the original Pheasant ? I have not had much to do with
these birds in their second reincarnation, and so cannot say whether
they are monogamous in the wild state. Nor can anyone else, I think,
as these birds seem only to have come under observation in the breeding
pens where custom allows them many wives.
I freely admit that a lot of the foregoing is conjecture, as indeed
is most of the matter in connection with this bird of mystery, and I
would not for one moment wish to force my opinions down anyone's
throat. It is said, however, that nothing happens in Nature for which
there is not a good reason, and it is in an honest endeavour to fathom
these reasons that I put forward these suggestions.
[Whether the Melanistic Pheasant, which is now known as Phasianus
colchicus mut. tenebrosus, is a reversion to the original type or not is
difficult to prove, but similar mutants have appeared in other species,
such as the Golden Pheasant and the Peacock, in both of which the
variety breeds true to type and, moreover, the melanistic blood seems to
predominate. Melanism, when it appears as a " sport " is very

persistent, as is seen in the melanistic race of leopards in the Malay
States where it has swamped the normal type, but there is little doubt
that it first appeared as a mutation. Black rabbits are common in
certain districts, and their numbers increase rapidly though, being
far more conspicuous than the normal type, they are more liable to
destruction.-- Ed.]

The colouring of an adult cock is wonderful, the coloured plates
do not do him justice, the wax-like sheen of blue on the head is
remarkable. There are two shades of blue, the face is royal blue
shading into turquoise blue. The brilliant scarlet chest follows on from
the royal blue and extends more than half-way down the belly,
shading into pale yellow, faint scarlet spots continue on in the yellow.
A young cock taken from a nest in August was not showing the
scarlet at the end of December, by the end of February a considerable
amount of scarlet was showing, breaking through the green feathers.
I should say it is at least two years before a cock is fully coloured. An
adult hen has two or three dull red feathers under the green on the chest.
I thought one of my birds was a young cock as these red feathers were
showing, but no further colouring has taken place in six months, so
I am convinced that this is an adult hen.
It is strange that these beautiful Parrakeets have shown up in three
different parts of South Australia this season, but only in very limited
numbers. Fortunately I have birds from each district, so barring
accidents am well set up for breeding.
One Sunday morning a farmer from the west coast of South
Australia rang me and said he wished to see the Scarlet-breasted
Parrakeets, as he thought he had one, and, naturally, I was very pleased
for him to come out. When he saw mine he thought his was like the
hen. Some years ago a dead cock bird was found in the same direction,

but about 150 miles away from where this farmer lived. I had a feeling .
that this must be a Scarlet so took a holiday and motored over, about
400 miles from Adelaide. On arrival at the farm it was dark, but we i
straight away got a lantern and were taken to a small aviary on the
front verandah. My delight, when I saw it was a hen Scarlet, can be
imagined. I asked how the bird was caught, and was told that one day
a Hawk was seen to catch this bird, and on running over to where
the bird had fallen it was found to be injured and very exhausted ; it
was taken inside and warmed. It was far too weak to feed, so they
mixed up granose, oatmeal and honey, with hot milk and hand-fed it.
Gradually an improvement was shown, and after a fortnight it had
recovered. While this bird was convalescent it was put out on the
verandah and the cock used to fly right down to the cage and, strange
to say, no attempt was made to capture him. By the time we arrived
the cock was nowhere to be seen. Fortunately I was able to secure
the hen bird and she is now in perfect health.
During the trip, which lasted a fortnight, we travelled 1,500 miles,
chiefly over unmade bush tracks in sparsely populated areas, but no
other Scarlet-breasts were seen.

This handlist has been prepared by Dr. John S. Armstrong for
the use of residents and visitors to the beautiful Samoan Islands in the
hope that it will enable them to recognize and record the habits of this
very interesting fauna before the march of time and progress has
denuded the hills and bush, with the inevitable result of destruction
of the bird-life.
The islanders of Samoa have from time immemorial been in the
habit of taming birds and the first discoverers of the islands found
" their houses full of Wood-pigeons ". The Samoans, we read, still
keep birds in captivity, but not to anything like the extent that was
the case when the islands were discovered.
There are some half-dozen species of Pigeons or Doves on the
islands, including the remarkable Tooth-billed Pigeon ( Didunculus )

The body and legs are those of a typical Pigeon, but the heavy bill
is notched on the cutting edge and hooked like the beak of a Parrot.
There is one very beautiful Lory (Vini australis), while another, the
Ruffed Lory ( Calliptilus solitarius ) of Fiji is often kept by the natives,
and escaped birds are sometimes met with in the bush. A most
beautiful scarlet-breasted Robin (Petroica pusilla), two Kingfishers,
a Fantail ( Rhipidura nebulosa), several species of Honeyeaters, and
a very beautiful Parrot Finch (Erythrura cyanovirens) are some of the
more attractive birds met with of the sixty-three species indigenous
to the islands. (John Bale, Sons and Danielsson, Ltd., Great Titchfield

I was interested to read Mr. Teague's letter on Hybrids in
the April number (p. 84).
In reply to the inquiry there, I can tell him that in my Records
of Birds Bred in Captivity (Witherby, 1926), the first, second, and fifth
crosses the writer mentions, i.e. the two Waxbill (Nos. 185a and c,
p. 216) and the Yellow-rumped Serin X Canary (No. 63 d, p. 187) were
included, though none of the three records are as satisfactory as one
would wish, and two only refer to success abroad.
Of the other hybrids reared by Mr. Teague, Cape Canary X Green
Singing Finch and vice versa, Linnet X Canary, and Linnet X Green
Singing Finch, I have no records at all.
If the breeder would give us particulars in our pages of these
successes, they would be of real value, and of especial interest to me,
a collector of such records and the possible producer of another edition
of my 1926 effort. E. Hopkinson.

Although most of the Birds of Paradise seem to be quite
hardy and fairly easy to cater for, their moult seems to be a difficult
problem, the new feathers remaining in their sheaths for a long time,
and then becoming hard and brittle, and breaking off at the least
touch. Then when the birds eventually get through their moult they
seem to be listless and weak without sufficient energy to face the winter.
I think more birds are lost through this faulty moult than from any
other cause, and am sure an article on the subject in the Magazine
would fill a much-needed want.

[The condition referred to by Mr. Martin is especially noticeable in
the Six-plumed birds (Parotid), which naturally live in a very damp
climate and there is little doubt that it is due to insufficient moisture.
A daily shower-bath would be good for these birds.-- Ed.]

Previously I mentioned the pair of Masked birds in my own aviaries

another aviary, where there was very little grass, two pairs of Masked
Lovebirds had young, not fully fledged. These two pairs were trans-
ferred to another aviary, well covered with grass, and one of them has
since had a nest from which the young left in perfect feather. In

which grass was very scarce, the young left the nest not properly
fledged.
It seems to me, therefore, that the solution of the problem is either
to supply ample quantities of lawn grass cuttings, or to have the aviary
so stocked that the numbers of birds would never be sufficient to
destroy the grass growing there. By so doing, the parent birds would
be able to obtain from the grass sufficient nourishment to complete
the diet necessary to rear the young in perfect condition.

The enterprising firm of Chapmans, Ltd. (24 Tottenham Court

one from Abyssinia, the other from Mexico. The former included
some rare Starlings, Crowned (Galeopsar salvadorii), White-capped
(Heteropsar albicapillus), Amethyst, Royal, and Superb Spreo ; also
Donaldson's Touraco and Dinemelli's Weavers. The Mexican collection
contained Swainson's and Blue Jays, Clarinos, Mocking Birds, Nonpareil
and Rainbow Buntings, Red Cardinals, and the rare Thick-billed
Cardinals and others. A very fine collection and all in good condition.
Such collections as these have been few and far between lately,
but the fact that they seem to have sold well is an indication of continued
or perhaps renewed interest in Aviculture in spite of the present economic
conditions. Aviculturists are as keen as ever, though they may not
be able to pay the prices they would formerly have given for rare
birds.

Hence we feel sure that members of the Avicultural Society will give
their whole-hearted support to the movement that is on foot to save
from the builders part of Dungeness Promontory, which is one of the
few remaining spots on our South Coast where the Lesser Tern, Kentish
Plover, and many more of our priceless possessions in bird life have
their home.
The land in question is imperilled by an imminent danger of
bungalow building along its shores ; but the Marquess of Tavistock
and others have evidenced their determination that action shall be
taken to avert the peril by having nominated two gentlemen as trustees,
charged with seeing that all proceeds of the contributions which are
now solicited shall be devoted to completing the purchase of two
hundred and seventy-one acres of the promontory as a Bird and Nature
Reserve. The two nominees who have accepted the trust are
Mr. E. Gr. B. Meade-Waldo, a well-known member of our Society,
and Chairman of the Watchers' Committee of the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds ; and Dr. Norman F. Ticehurst, author of a
standard book on the birds of Kent.
An urgent appeal is now made to everyone who cares for
preserving untouched England in its natural state, and especially
to naturalists whose interest will be so admirably served if
this land can be bought and preserved for all time. Donations
of any size, shillings or pounds, will be most gratefully received and
should be made payable to the " Dungeness Preservation Fund ",
and sent to the Honorary Treasurer, Percival Jackling, Esq., O.B.E.,

<bodyText confidence="0.976866136363636" page_id="56221973"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
(i GOURA CRIST AT A SCLATERI)
By T. H. Newman, E.Z.S.
The members of this family of Pigeons are the largest existing
representatives of the order, and are characterized by the erect fan-
shaped crest which adorns the head as well as by their large size,
while they are further distinguished by having the metatarsus covered
all over with small six-sided scales ; there are sixteen feathers in the
tail.
About seven forms are known which are placed in two species.
They inhabit New Guinea and some of the neighbouring islands.
Little has been recorded about their habits, but they spend most of
their time on the ground, frequently on the banks of rivers, and feed
on berries and small aquatic creatures. They nest in trees, laying one
large white egg. It may be of interest to quote the description of
probably the first Englishman to meet with the Crowned Pigeon.
Dampier, in the year 1699, wrote : " One of my men killed a stately
land-fowl, as big as the largest dunghill-cock. It was of a sky-colour ;
only in the middle of the wings was a white spot, about which were
some reddish spots. On the crown it had a large bunch of long feathers,
which appeared very pretty. His bill was like a Pidgeon's. His crop
was full of small berries. It lays an egg as big as a large hen's egg.
for our men climbed the tree where it nested and brought off one egg."

Sclater's Crowned Pigeon is found in Central and South New
Guinea, it was met with by the British Ornithologists' Union Expedition
in Dutch New Guinea, large numbers were killed for food, as it appeared
almost the only fresh meat to be had. A description of its habits will
be found in the Avicultural Magazine, 1929, p. 163. It has nested
for several years in Mr. G. H. Gurney's aviaries at Keswick Hall,
where young have been hatched, but not reared.

ST. HELENA SEED-EATERS BREEDING
SUCCESSFULLY IN A CAGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99511724" page_id="56221974"  page_num="142" year="" vol="">
By Norman G. Allison
Perhaps the following account of the success I have attained in
the breeding of St. Helena Seed-eaters (Serinus flaviventris) in an
ordinary canary breeding cage may be of interest to members. I do
not suppose for a moment that this is the first time that this species
has been bred in captivity, either in an aviary or cage, but my pair
have produced their youngsters under quite adverse conditions, and
as these Seed-eaters are very good songsters and really quite attractive
birds altogether they are well worth breeding.
All my foreign birds are brought in for the winter months, and the
sexes separated so that there is less risk of them attempting to breed
during the inclement months. Towards the end of February the hen
Seed-eater commenced to lay, although she was separated from the
cock bird and in a cage together with a hen Green Singing Finch and
a cock Grassfinch. She laid three eggs on the floor of the cage, and
I then hoped that she would not attempt further breeding until the
better weather arrived. However, towards the middle of March she
again showed signs of desiring to go to nest so, after a little juggling
with cages, etc., I succeeded in clearing a canary breeding cage of its
inmates and in one corner fixed up an ordinary wooden travelling
cage, and in the other a Hartz-mountain wicker cage in which I placed
a nest-pan with felt lining. The cage in question is about 3 feet
in length.
The introduction of the cock Seed-eater caused me a little consterna-
tion as he was most hostile towards his future bride, and spent most

of his time denuding the lady of the feathers on her head and neck,
until she eventually became a veritable rag-bag. However, in due
course, eggs arrived in the Hartz cage, but only a very poor attempt
was made to build a nest, the hen apparently thinking that the felt
lining was quite sufficient for her needs.
She commenced sitting in earnest on the 24th March, but I was not
aware of the number of eggs, if any, as the Hartz cage was a permanent
fixture and previous experiences with foreign bird breeding had
taught me that curiosity often killed ones hopes. On the 8th April
the familiar squeaks of young birds could be heard. Then the next
pitfall appeared in the shape of suitable food for them to rear the
youngsters. No doubt it will be remembered that at this time the
weather was extremely cold and no greenstuff was procurable, so I had
to fall back upon occasional pieces of watercress, which, by the way,
was also very scarce at that time. I also gave the parents a pot of
insectivorous food as used for the Softbills, together with a few meal-
worms of which they were extremely fond. Of course they also had
the usual foreign bird seed mixture. All appeared to be going well,
with the hen feeding regularly and the cries of the babies daily getting
stronger, until the 15th April when youngster No. 1 was found dead
at the bottom of the cage. This one was followed on the 19th with
youngster No. 2.
My feelings were now somewhat mixed as I took down the nest
and thoroughly washed the Hartz cage, and the only consolation I could
get from this failure was from the fact that the weather was so cold
and miserable that I could not have blamed a human being forsaking
his or her young, let alone a St. Helena Seed-eater.
On the 5th May the hen again commenced to sit, and on the 17th
the cries of young birds were again heard. It will be noticed that,
whereas the eggs took fifteen days to hatch in the first instance, at the
second attempt they actually hatched in twelve and a half days
according to my records, although, of course, not being able to examine
the nest daily, I may be half a day or so out in my calculations.
All went well with this nest until the 23rd May, when one youngster
was found dead on the cage bottom, and my hopes again began to
sink. However, knowing there to be still young in the nest, I succeeded

Norman G. Allison -- St. Helena Seed-eaters
in curbing my curiosity for some days, until I was eventually rewarded
in seeing two heads appear over the edge of the nest at feeding time.
On the 2nd June the first youngster left the nest, followed on the
5th by the second. Then more trouble occurred, for the cock bird,
which all the way through had not been on at all good terms with
the hen, commenced to persecute the babies and, had I not luckily
spotted him going for one, I firmly believe he would have eventually
killed them both--in fact, I now think that the reason the others were
found dead was that the cock had killed them through jealousy.
I promptly removed him to another cage in sight of the hen and she
has done her duty so well that they are now feeding themselves, and
I intend to-morrow (9th June) to separate them altogether from the hen.
The two youngsters are very much like the hen in appearance,
except that the first one out of the nest is a cock, as he is slightly
lighter in body colour with a faint tinge of green on wings, rump, and
tail, whereas the other is extremely dark with an obvious hen look.
They were supplied daily with a handful of fresh seeding grass,
which at this time of the year is very plentiful, and of which they are
very fond, insectivorous mixture, ordinary egg-food mixed with a
little rape and maw seed, foreign bird seed mixture, and a hopper of
Goldfinch mixture. They also had about thirty mealworms daily and,
as far as it was possible to ascertain, the hen alone fed the youngsters,
and the main items of food were the mealworms, egg-food and seeding
grass--they hardly partook of any millet seed during the whole period
of rearing.
The youngsters are now twenty-three days old and fine healthy
little chaps they look, well repaying the attention that has been
bestowed upon them. The hen, by the way, is now thinking about a
further effort to bring some more Cockney Seed-eaters into the world.
They are the only foreign birds I have so far succeeded in breeding
this year, the reason, I am afraid, being the wretched weather we have
experienced in London. Even my Long-tailed G-rassfinches, wdiich
reared young last year, have done nothing else but fight terribly this
year, until they now look very bedraggled, and the hen very bare round
the face. I also had the bad luck to lose my hen Gouldian Finch during
a particularly severe cold spell, with egg-binding, and upon examining

the nest found she had already laid two eggs, which looked extremely
nice, but made me very bad-tempered when I realized that young
Gouldians would not be mine this year.
I am afraid these notes are a little long-winded, but perhaps they
may serve some good purpose if any of our members are thinking of
breeding this very interesting Seed-eater in captivity, and in conclusion
would just point out two rather interesting and unusual peculiarities

incessantly during incubation--a subdued form of the cock's song, and
secondly, the extreme animosity shown by the cock towards the hen
during incubation, and to the young after hatching.

HYBRID GRASSFINCHES AND OTHERS
By S. McGredy
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999746952380952" page_id="56221977"  page_num="145" year="" vol="">
In the early spring of 1931 one of a pair of Masked Grassfinches
died off and the survivor must have paired with a Long-tailed Grassfinch.
As I had quite a small flock of the latter in this particular aviary I
presume this to be quite a natural result, both these species being so
closely related.
The sexes of the parents I am unable to state definitely, but I believe
the Masked Finch to be a hen. My supposition is strengthened by
the fact that " she " has disappeared for the past ten days and, though
I searched carefully to-day, I could find no trace of a carcass. As the
aviary in which these Finches are confined is rather a large one with
a flight 36 by 24 feet thickly planted with a shelter in proportion,
I came naturally to the conclusion that the " Masked " was again
nesting.
The hybrids, of which I must have quite a dozen from two nests,
are pretty birds and clearly indicate their parentage. Their plumage
is a very even mixture of the colours of the " Masked " and " Longtail ",
and the same remark applies to their beaks. They have the " mask "
of the Masked Finch above the upper mandible, but instead of the
mask below the lower mandible they have a round black bib about
half the size of that of the " Longtail ". They have a broad black
band forming a girdle in the middle of the belly as in the parents.

S. McGredy--Hybrid Grassfinches and Others
Whilst quite a pretty hybrid I would not recommend any member
to deliberately try and breed them as they are not quite so attractive
as the Longtail Grassfinch which, in my opinion, is the prettiest of all
the Grassfinches, not even excepting Gouldians.
Grassfinches breed freely with me and I have had, as stated, quite
a little flock for some years.
Against all the walls of my aviaries--and covering as much space as
possible--I have frames about 12 inches deep covered with cheap
garden trellis. After erection these are stuffed with dry heather and
once provided I have never known Grassfinches to make use of any other
nesting-sites, though plenty are provided inside and out. In fact,
all Finches seem to relish the dense natural " hedge " and one never
knows what treasure is going to emerge as the nests in many cases
cannot be seen.
The great beauty of this type of indoor cover is that one's natural
curiosity is kept in bounds as it is practically impossible to go * ' poking
.around ". But, and a very big but it is, if mice can get into the shelter
it is practically impossible to dislodge them without pulling all the
heather out.
Some three years ago my man informed me that a lot of birds
seemed to have deserted their nests (I am afraid he was poking around
against orders). On investigation I discovered, in a bottom corner of
the framework, traces of mouse droppings. I examined every nesting
receptacle in the aviary--but no mouse. In the end I shook the
" hedge " vigorously and out jumped Master Mouse. Not content
I started pulling heather out, and inside half an hour, with the active
assistance of my man, ten corpses lay on the floor. Unfortunately,
I started to pull another hedge in the same aviary to pieces and spoilt
a lot of nests. I may add this is the only serious trouble (by serious
I mean undiscovered) I have ever had with mice and though half a day
was spent in examining the aviary, both inside and out, the method of
ingress remains to this day a mystery.
For nesting sites outside I favour clipped box-trees, and I always
nail to two stout posts about 6 feet above the top a wooden cover
roofed with felt to prevent rain reaching any nests.
During my tour of investigation to-day I discovered in one of these

the tiniest nest I have ever seen and from which flew a cock Green
Singing Finch. On inspection the nest contained two newly hatched
young and several eggs, and as the Singing Finch lost his mate several
years ago I haven't the foggiest idea what the other parent of the
nestlings can be. If they survive and the Editor thinks they are
worthy of notice I will watch them carefully and record the result in
some future issue.
Though I have a mixed collection of several hundred birds, housed
in five large and three small aviaries, I have reared few hybrids with
the exception of those between Lovebirds (of which I have had several
crosses). The only hybrid other than those stated that I can recall
to memory was Zebra Finch X Chestnut-breasted Finch (?). The
latter I am not quite sure of.

By Harry A. Collin
Many people seem to have the idea that Lories and Lorikeets are
very difficult to feed, and also to keep clean and healthy. I have kept
representatives of various species for some years, and my experience
is that they are no more trouble than the Seed-eaters. Give them
a good draught- and damp-proof shed, with a good layer of sawdust
on the floor, and an outside flight and they will be perfectly happy,
and will give their owner a lot of pleasure with their beauty and
entertaining ways.
They are real acrobats and the most active of the Parrot-like birds,
and to my way of thinking certainly the most beautiful.
My pair of Swainson's Lorikeets went to nest last July and hatched
two chicks, but for some unknown cause these only lived to about
twelve or fourteen days. The old pair went to nest again in January,
and have reared one youngster, which is now four and a half months old,
and a very fine bird. Incubation took twenty-one days and the young
one left the nest when about nine weeks old. Its colouring is very
beautiful, but not quite so brilliant as that of the old birds ; its eyes
are black up to the present.

Harry A. Collin--Lorikeets and Lovebirds
I feed them on Mellin's Food and Nestle's Milk, diluted with water,,
with pure honey in a separate pot, also green food. I also offer fruit,,
but they rarely touch it except perhaps a grape or two. They will
not touch Canary seed, but sometimes will nibble a millet spray.
I think this is only for the pleasure of pulling it to pieces. They are
exceedingly fond of bathing and this keeps their plumage in lovely
condition.
On this treatment they are always in perfect condition and have
never had a day's illness during the four years they have been in my
possession.
Lord Tavistock advises Dr. Allinson's Food in preference to Mellin's,.
and perhaps this is better ; but as my birds have done so well with
the Mellin's I have kept to that.
Deferring to Mr. G. R. Hutchinson's remarks in the Avicultural.
Magazine for February, on Masked Lovebirds leaving the nest partly
fledged. I have kept these birds since the first importation, and now
have the third generation flying. They are kept in an aviary with
concrete floors, both the shelter and flight, covered with sand, and have
never had grass. Of course I give them plenty of green food. I have
only once had them leave the nest partly feathered. The only difficulty
I have had with them is that they will persist in nesting in boxes or
husks in the shelter where it is too dry and so there is a large percentage
of young dead in the shells. I keep Masked, Nyasa and Red Faced
Lovebirds and Cockatiels together and have had no serious*
disturbance, but when I tried to introduce a pair of Fischer's I soon
had plenty of trouble. The Fischer's tried to murder everything in
sight, and one afternoon, hearing a noise in the aviary, I ran there
and found one of the Fischer's just finishing the last of four young
Cockatiels and the other doing its best to slay the mother.
Needless to say, the Fischer's were banished at once, and since
then there has been peace in this department.

A first list of additions to my Records of Birds Bred in Captivity
(Witherby, 1926) appeared in the 1930 volume of the Magazine (p. 18).
More information having accumulated, the time seems ripe for another
instalment, to include both Addenda and Corrigenda. The pages
referred to are those of the original volume, and the numbers also
indicate the position any new entry would take there.

A SAD STORY OF COCKATIELS
By A. C. Furner
If our Editor can find room for this tale of woe in our Magazine
I should be grateful, as I am anxious to hear if any other member of
our Society has experienced the trouble which I am having with my
Cockatiels. My dates are uncertain, but facts only too certain.
I purchased my first pair of Cockatiels about three years ago,,
and kept them in an aviary with my Budgerigars. Their nest-box
was a rectangular box about 14 by 8 by 8 inches with concave
bottom to receive the eggs. The birds went to nest about six months
after purchase and as soon as the eggs were laid the cock bird became
a fiend, chasing the Budgerie from their nests and generally causing
havoc. I had to take them out and the opportunity of young Cockatiels
vanished for the first time.
I then divided the aviary into two sections with netting partition,,
and the birds went to nest again, and about a fortnight later eggs were
laid and we were going strong again when, due to dry weather after

rain, the wooden feeding-slide warped and fell out and, of course, the
birds eloped and bang went the hopes of young Cockatiels for the
second time.
I advertised their loss and the same evening recovered the cock
bird, which had fallen down a chimney about half a mile away. The
following day a ring on the 'phone told me that my hen had been seen
in some allotment gardens about 3 miles away from my aviaries. The
cock bird was duly taken out as a decoy and with the aid of the old
schoolboy method of riddle stick and string the hen was soon back
with her mate in the cage.
I then put them in another aviary and they went to nest again; more
eggs. When they had been sitting about eight days I was alarmed to
hear the hen bird kicking up a fearful commotion. Investigation
found the cock dead on the floor apparently as a result of his sojourn
in the chimney. Bang went the hopes of young Cockatiels for the
third time.
I replaced the cock bird and last season we had eggs again, and this
time I found the hen dead one morning and the cock bird sitting on
the eggs.
In a vain hope to save the situation I rang up a supplier and had
a new hen put on passenger train, and introduced her the same day to
the aviary. From that moment the eggs were never thought of, and
bang went hopes of young Cockatiels for the fourth time.
This year, as a crown to my misfortunes, this is what happens :
they mate, the hen lays, and for a day or two I see the hen bird out in
the daytime and the cock bird in the evening, all according to book.
About four days after, both birds are out, and on looking inside I find
the eggs broken and apparently half eaten away.
I believe my aviary to be free from rats or mice and have seen no
signs of either, so I must conclude that either Mother or Father has
a nasty habit, and I think it is Father. This has happened three
times since March of this year.

By Dr. Leon Patrick, President
Reason, observation, and experience--that dependable trinity of
science--have taught us that the greatest pleasures of life are those
that are available to everyone. They arise from the simple, funda-
mental things in nature--the beautiful clouds, the ocean with its broad
beaches, the mountains, lakes, streams, flowers, trees, and, most
intriguing of all, the birds.
Birds are the dominating feature of nature, they have the greatest
activity, the greatest emotional variety; they show the highest
extremes of beauty in colour and pattern, they have the most striking
and highly developed courtship of any group of creatures, and their
songs are by far the most beautiful and elaborate music that the world
knew before the coming of man.
Birds, in fact, are nature at her best, and we who are interested in
conservation are coming to understand that bird life forms an ever-
changing background for human life--indispensable, yet always
fanciful. And we learn why the birds, with their twenty-odd thousand
known species, are man's greatest allies in the struggle of survival.
Yet in spite of their sesthetic appeal and their economic value
to mankind many beautiful and interesting species are fast nearing
extinction. Like our Passenger Pigeon, the Carolina Conure, and the
Heath Hen they will soon be but a haunting memory--unless some
concerted, organized, practical plan or conservation is inaugurated
to save them.
Others have said all this to a careless and indifferent public. But
mere talk, however tangible and sincere, accomplishes nothing. Some-
body has to do something--action is what is needed.
Realizing this, a group of far-seeing and unselfish individuals have
organized the Whittier Ornithological Academy--the which is a
Foundation chartered by the State of California " for the purpose of
study, observation, and research along ornithological lines, with
especial attention being directed to aviculture as a practical medium
of perpetuating those rare and interesting species of birds, both native
and foreign, that are threatened with or nearing extinction."

So you see we are engaged in a realistic task of great significance ;
especially vital because bird propagation seems to be the blind spot
on the retina of the American conscience.
Ten months ago the Academy existed only as a vision in one man's
mind. To-day it is a practical reality--a thriving institution with
financial reserve, employing three men in the constant care of the
greatest bird collection in America.
For this unique avicultural park, together with all it means to
natural science and aviculture in particular, all bird lovers are indebted,,
primarily, to three eminently public-spirited citizens :*--
First, to Dr. W. F. Dexter, President of Whittier College, a man
whose interest in natural science is both scholarly and practical, and
whose vision, advice, and council have helped to formulate the plans
and policies of the Academy.
Second, to Mr. F. E. Booth, of San Francisco, a manufacturer who
has achieved an unusual business success while actively concerned
with bird conservation in its truest sense. As a personal friend of the
late J. Y. de Laveaga, Mr. Booth voluntarily became plenipotentiary
extraordinary for the Academy in its negotiations for the splendid
collection of Waterfowl which Mr. de Laveaga had acquired during the
past twenty years. That Whittier Ornithological Academy became
the happy recipient of this exceptional collection, as a gift from the
de Laveaga heirs, is due directly to Mr. Booth's resourcefulness,
sagacity, and untiring effort--all engendered by his innate love for
birds. Consistent with his usual perspicacity, Mr. Booth visualizes
" a near future when Whittier Ornithological Academy will be the show
place of the world for wild birds of every kind and from every country
on the globe
Third, to Mr. W. K. Kellogg, of Battle Creek, Michigan, business
executive and capitalist of more than ordinary distinction--a dynamic
disciple of all that is good and beautiful in nature, who has contributed
and accomplished more for the perpetuation of rare equestrian and
avian species than any other man in America.
Being appraised of conditions, Mr. Kellogg voluntarily sponsored
the Academy's cause and very graciously provided funds for the
transportation of, and the necessary equipment for, the J. Y. de

Laveaga Collection of Waterfowl, which, by the way, is the second
largest in the world.
In deference to Mr. Kellogg's inestimable help, the Directors of
the Foundation have decided that the 35 acre tract on which the birds
are now located shall be designated and known as The W. K. Kellogg
Bird Park.
The W. K. Kellogg Bird Park is about half-covered with timber
in its primeval state, through which runs a small stream -- all of which
lends itself ideally to treatment as a park and provides most admirable
conditions for propagating the birds.
These glimpses will epitomize the set-up at the W. Iv. Kellogg Bird
Park, which is already destined to be the mecca of all bird lovers

By G. Beever
A few years ago when I sent my first article to this Magazine on
Pheasants I felt rather ashamed of myself, as I thought Pheasants
were such easily kept, everyday birds that aviculturists would not be
interested in them. Some time afterwards I read in the Magazine
that the Editor wanted articles dealing with the more commonly
kept birds, as they were of more general interest. Since then I have
not felt I was such an intruder when writing anything about Pheasants.
I am still puzzled why thousands more bird-lovers do not keep
one or more varieties of Fancy Pheasants. These birds equal any
other in beauty, cost little to procure and practically nothing to keep,
and above all are hardier than any other ornamental bird. They can
be kept in almost any back garden, even in an industrial town. I have
seen Golden Pheasants actually reared on a railway siding right in
the centre of a large industrial city. There are also hundreds of
municipal parks in this country where a few pheasant aviaries would
be an enormous attraction. These birds are a never ending source
of delight, especially to children.
If only some of these public park committees would erect a few
Pheasant aviaries others would be sure to follow.
The great recommendation of keeping Pheasants is that they require
no one with special knowledge to keep them in condition. They can
be fed just like ordinary Bantams so long as they are given plenty of
fresh green food.
An idea I have had in my head for years, which might give an
impetus to the keeping of fancy Pheasants, is that a club should be
formed, say of twenty or thirty members, each one of whom would be
willing to give say one or two surplus Golden Cocks every year. These
could be offered in lots of two or three to any municipal park that
would construct a suitable aviary. This might start several aviaries
in different parts of the country and there is no doubt it would lead to
a demand for other species which could be bought from the club on
a commercial basis. I should be willing to do my share if any other
members would agree to do the same.

160 G. Beever--Some Bemarks on Pheasants and Other Birds
A club could also arrange for classes for Pheasants at some of the
agricultural shows. There is a class still included in the schedule of
the Crystal Palace Bird Show, but Pheasants cannot be shown in
cages ; they require small movable pens for the purpose. There would
be no difficulty in showing Goldens, Amhersts, and the various Kaleeges
as these birds are generally very tame. There are several shows in
the U.S.A. that include classes for fancy Pheasants. I have seen
Golden Pheasants in small aviaries exhibited at the Ideal Homes
Exhibition at the Olympia and they appeared quite at home.
I made an interesting experiment last May when I conducted
a party of naturalists round Captain Hopkins's and Paul Lambert's
aviaries at Kirby Moorside and Nawton. Most of these people had
never seen Pheasants of the fancy varieties before so they were com-
pletely unbiased. I drew up a list of about twenty species and asked
them to vote on which they considered the most beautiful. I have
mentioned in previous articles that I always counted the Amherst
cock number one, not solely on account of his striking colouring but&apos;
because I consider him the most perfectly shaped bird in existence.
However, the voting came out something like this : 1, Satyr Tragopan ;
2, Amherst; 3, Golden ; 4, Peacock Pheasant; 5, Swinhoe ; 6, Beeves.
.1 do not think anyone can quarrel with this selection. I might say
that when I saw the Chinquis Peacock Pheasant at close quarters for
the first time with the sun lighting up those wonderful ocelli, I was
really taken aback by his quiet but beautiful plumage.
As regards this list, I should replace the Swinhoe by the Edwards.
The cock of the latter in plumage appears to be a perfect article, being
of an even metallic lustre all over, whereas the Swinhoe does not appear
completely finished, owing to parts of the wings being without lustre.
I am afraid some pheasants at Begent's Park are affected by the
heavy deposit of London soot and can never appear as bright as those
kept a long way from industrial centres. Strange to say the Blue
Peacocks do not seem to be affected by the soot, as those in London
appear to be as bright and sheeny as those kept in the country.
There is no disputing the fact that the Satyr Tragopan cock is a
really wonderfully coloured bird. His plumage is brilliant but not
gaudy. I hear Captain Hopkins has now a Temminck cock which

G. Beever--Some Remarks on Pheasants and Other Birds 161
is quite equal to the Satyr. What a pity Tragopans are so expensive.
If they were down to #5 a pair they would be in great demand.
What is the reason so few are bred ? Even when eggs are laid they
are often infertile, and, when fertile, the chicks generally are killed by
some accident or are victims of cats or other vermin. It is almost
uncanny the persistence with which the rarest birds are the victims
of accidents while the common varieties seem to escape them. I have
a theory in regard to Tragopans not breeding which may have some
truth in it or may be sheer nonsense. These birds come from high
altitudes and in their wild state must be continually climbing about
in search of food. In captivity they are put in an aviary built on
perfectly level ground and in consequence get no exercise and very
likely become too fat and lazy for breeding purposes. Perhaps if
some large aviaries were built on a hillside over some rocks or boulders
for these birds they would get plenty of exercise and lay fertile eggs.
I wish other readers would give their views on breeding Tragopans.
Another point regarding Pheasants that I have never yet seen
thoroughly explained is why some breeds, especially Swinhoe's, are
nearly always subject to crooked toes. Does this happen because
the birds are born weak and cannot walk properly during their first
week, thus causing the toes to become twisted inwardly ? I have
reared plenty of Goldens, Amherst, and Eeeves, but I never had any
chicks with crooked toes, so I cannot solve it.
It seems that nearly all the common species of Pheasants will
cross, although the hybrids are infertile. I have actually seen an
Impeyen x Hokis cock, an extraordinary hybrid, as one is the most
metallic of Pheasants and the other the least metallic. Other extra-
ordinary crosses are Soemmerrings X Fireback, Amherst X Swinhoe ;
and I have heard this week of a Swinhoe X Beeves which is new to me.
Silver x Beeves seem fairly common, also Beeves X Golden, the
cock of this cross being a very fine bird, maroon all over. Perhaps
the most extraordinary hybrid ever produced was one between a
Guinea-fowl and a Peacock. The parents in this case appear, too,
much more distinct from one another than any other two breeds of
Pheasants.

Practical Hints on Gouldian Finches
all the newspapers to the effect that another American bird had followed
the way of the Passenger Pigeon and the Carolina Parrakeet. This
was the Heath Hen (Tympanuchus cupido ), a species of American
Grouse which was formerly very common in the Hew England States,
a few being still left on the island known as Martha&apos;s Vineyard off
the coast of Hew York. This bird has been highly protected for
several years by the U.S.A. Government. However, in February this
year an odd cock has again turned up which is believed to be the sole
living representative of a once prolific species.
A few years ago the American people, with a few exceptions, laughed
at the idea of artificially protecting their native birds, but now they
have swung to the other extreme and are protecting birds that do not
need it and which are really vermin.

The Gouldian Finch ( Poephila gouldice) is a truly wonderful little
bird from the northern parts of Australia. From time to time it is
imported freely into Europe but, although ready enough to breed
in captivity, very few aviculturists have been really successful in
keeping it for any great length of time through lack of knowledge
of its requirements. Mr. Teague has taken great pains to find out just
what conditions are necessary to ensure success with this delightful
bird, and his article, published first in the Avicultural Magazine
for May, 1932, contains so many useful hints that I asked him to allow
the Avicultural Society to reprint it in pamphlet form, as by widely
circulating such information it should be possible to save many
Gouldians that might otherwise be lost. Mr. Teague at once gave his
consent, and I feel sure that all who admire this lovely species will
owe him a debt of gratitude.
The pamphlet is issued with a coloured plate showing both the red-
and black-headed phase, and will be found most useful by all who
keep foreign Finches. The price is Is. Id. post free from our publishers.

In the April number of our Magazine which I have just received
there are two points on which I beg to comment.

<listItem confidence="0.9391551" page_id="56221995"  page_num="163" year="" vol="">
1. You say that the Red-faced Lovebird ( Agapornis pullaria ) has
never been bred with full success in captivity. I am, however, sure
that this species has been bred with complete success in Germany
during the last three years. A short notice to this effect appeared
in the Gefiederte Welt; I have forgotten the breeder's name, but
Mr. Karl Neunzig, the editor of the Gefiederte Welt can certainly confirm
my statement.
2. I am very glad to be able to contradict your statement about
the Silver and Golden Pheasant as to be nearly extinct (the Silver)
or very rare (the Golden) in the wild state.

Luckily, the Silver Pheasant is still abundant in the mountains
of South China (Fokien). I can get as many as I want from my bird-
dealer, although most of them arrive in a most miserable condition
in Shanghai. On the other hand, the insular form of the Silver, viz.
Euplocomus whiteheadi, which w^as discovered by Whitehead on the
island of Hainan, seems to be extinct. I made great efforts to obtain
this Pheasant but all in vain, and a very old resident of Hainan informs
me that he has seen none of this Pheasant during the last twelve years.
Of Goldens about 300 arrive every spring in our bird market and if
somebody would give an order he could easily obtain double the
quantity. They arrive from Itchang, each bird confined in a very
narrow bamboo basket in which they cannot stand upright and cannot
turn. In these baskets the poor birds have to remain for months and
ure shipped to Hong Kong, Singapore, and India. They are all of
exactly the same shades ; there is not the slightest difference in colour,
as we often find it in tame Goldens. Most of them are cocks. Last
year out of 280 I was only able to pick two hens.

THE HEARING OF FOSTER-CHILDREN BY CAYENNE
LAPWINGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986715592592593" page_id="56221996"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
One of the most interesting happenings amongst the birds at
Lilford at the present time is the rearing of three Common Lapwings
(Vanellus vulgaris) by two females or a pair of Cayenne Lapwings.
(Vanellus cayennensis). The latter, natives of South America, resemble
our English Lapwing in appearance, but are considerably larger,
differently coloured, and are armed with a decided spur on the shoulder
of each wing. Delightful aviary birds, these examples have thrived
here for some years. In 1931 they made a typical Lapwing's nest and
devotedly sat upon clear eggs ; these, four in number, closely resembled
certain types of Common Lapwing's eggs, but on the whole were more
like those of the Avocet.
Nesting again, in April of the present year, fears were entertained
that the eggs might again be infertile. Search was therefore instituted
for a Lapwing's nest, which was kept under observation until our
doubts were verified. On 7th May three Lapwing's eggs on the point
of being chipped were placed under the American bird, the fourth being
left with the natural parent. The young, on leaving the nest two days
later, behaved as only young Peewits can behave ; they squatted
about, reappearing only when they judged from the call of their foster-
parents that the coast was clear. From the first they took to earth-
worms, and a week later were eating artificial food freely ; and at
the time of writing (1st June) are half-grown, partly feathered, and
apparently out of all danger.
The Cayenne birds, I may add, have been most devoted parents,
incessantly calling when danger threatened and brooding often during
the cold, wet spells.

THE MOULTING OF BIRDS OF PARADISE

I think the difficulty sometimes experienced in moulting Birds
of Paradise is largely due to the way in which they are commonly
kept--in cages or small aviaries in stuffy birdrooms.
They are essentially birds which need exercise, fresh air, and, if
possible, opportunities for bathing in rain- and dew-soaked foliage.
Last winter I obtained a pair of Rothschilds' Birds of Paradise
which I was obliged to keep under the usual birdroom conditions.
They got stuck in the moult, and would have gone to pieces entirely
if left indoors. Soon after being turned into aviaries with outdoor
flights they began to improve, and now the moult is again well under
way and new feathers are coming nicely. Unlike the Kings, which
spend a lot of time in the shelter, they are a great deal in the open
air, and are very active, constantly flying about and leaping from
perch to perch.

THE IMPORTANCE OF A BALANCED DIET
I was much interested in Mr. A. Martin's letter re the moulting
of Birds of Paradise in the last issue, also the Editor's opinion regarding
same.
The assumption of the Editor that moisture is no doubt the cause
of this, is perhaps right, but I am inclined to believe that it is in the
feeding.
In the wild state naturally the birds acquire enough of the natural
substances for feather growing and maintenance of body stamina, but
the tendency of feeding in captivity leans to an inadequate supply of
essential substances.
I believe many of the softbill fanciers still use a dry food as a stock
food, and as I have previously mentioned, a dry food is very deficient
in essential substances.
I am inclined to assume this condition to a deficiency of fat-soluble
substances but, not having had these birds long enough to go through
the moult, I am unable to say for sure, it may be through a deficiency

of Vitamin B (water-soluble) : this substance is one of birds 5 greatest
needs, but I should not like to confine the cause to any one substance
without practical experience of same.
I am not assuming that the cause of difficult moulting is caused
by a deficiency in the food without foundation, I have conclusive 1
proof in many instances that it is so. I cannot do better than quote
from a letter I have just received from a Mrs. Charrington : this good
lady had Budgerigars that left the nest with no feathers on and, on
taking my advice to feed the afflicted birds on a balanced food that I
supplied, feathers started to grow after about a week, and the birds
are now in very fine healthy condition with normal feathers.
Further, I have the assurance of a well known Budgerigar judge
and member of our Society, to wit, Mr. E. J. Brown, of Southampton,
that he has never had a runner since using the same food, vide his
letter in Cage Birds , 12th March.
The importance of a Vitamin balanced food for all livestock cannot
be over-emphasized, old methods must be left behind, as a little
illustration of the great value, I give the latest established facts on
Vitamin B.
A deficiency of this substance will cause the following complaints:--
enteritis, bouts of alternately constipation and diarrhoea, colitis (or
inflammation of the large bowel), indigestion, internal organs over-
lade with fat, unhealthy skin, heart abnormality and paralysis, or
polyneuritis. This deficiency causes also loss of appetite, or a depraved
appetite (a craving for unnatural foods). Animals eat their fur and
excreta, birds plucking and eating their feathers, etc. It can be gathered
from this, then, that feather plucking Parrots can easily be cured from
this distressing complaint by the administration of adequate supplies
of Vitamin B, and is not caused by excessive consumption of animal
food, which I believe to be the general opinion, but an unbalanced diet.
It can safely be said that diet causes 95 per cent at least of the
complaints in man, beast, and bird. All aviculturists must take
advantage of the information that scientists place at our disposal if
they wish for success. If they demand an analyst report of the foods
they use they will know if it is adequate or not.

THE MELANISTIC MUTANT PHEASANT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98586625" page_id="56221999"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
In the article on the Melanistic Mutant that appeared under
my name in the June issue of the Avicultural Magazine, there is
a slight erratum. I am reported as having written "For some time
it was put down as a sport ... to be classed on a par with black and
wild rabbits." I actually wrote " black and white wild rabbits ",
which I think makes better sense.
In view of recent knowledge, I do not think the Melanistic can
be considered in the same category as other examples of melanism.
The Golden Mutant, known as the Black-faced Golden Pheasant,
while breeding true to type, is very difficult to rear, and the eggs are
frequently infertile, while the Melanistic Mutant is exactly the reverse.
It is the easiest to rear of any, going to covert at a much younger age,
and it is strongly fertile. The black rabbit, regrettably enough in my
opinion, does not beget black. There is one on a farm I know well.
It was there last year, having been seen many times, and always in
or around the same spot. No one could bag it. A sweepstake was
placed upon its head, but still it eluded guns and ferrets alike. This
year it is still to be seen in almost the same spot. But it is still alone
in its colouring. It is quite unthinkable that any rabbit should be
barren, and though there is not another black one for it to mate with,
its progeny, be it male or female, would show some signs of melanism--\0x25A0-
possibly there might even be a mixed brood, some black some normal.
But divil a black hair anywhere save on this particular rabbit. This
seems to indicate that the Melanistic Mutant is not to be considered
in the same category as other examples of melanism which are, if not
actually transient, expiring with the individual, at any rate insecure
or infertile.

DEATH OF AN OLD WOODPECKER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977339205882353" page_id="56222000"  page_num="168" year="" vol="">
Visitors to Foxwarren will be sorry to hear of the death of my old
Brazilian Yellow-fronted Woodpecker (Melanerpes flavifrons). The
bird had been in my possession for seven years, and for some time
before this our late President, Mr. H. D. Astley, had him. I believe
he was about 15 years old, which is not a bad age for a Woodpecker.
He was delightfully tame, and a great pet, and we miss him very
much.
A. Ezra.
THE FIDELITY OF A BRAZILIAN TEAL
So much at one time and another has been written about the so-
called Lovebird-like devotion of certain pairs of birds in confinement
that I venture to place on record the very practical manner in which
the bereaved male of a pair of Brazilian Teal quickly consoled himself,
and evidently, from his point of view, made the very best of unforeseen
circumstances.
Our stock of Brazilian Teal ( N . brasiliensis) at the time of the
occurrence (20th May of the present year) included an unattached
female of 1931 and a devoted breeding pair. The latter had been
inseparable for several years, and the male, an important little person
amongst other Ducks, was ever ready to guard the hen or spend his
fife fussing around her. On the evening of the 19th instant it was
noticed for the first time that the female of this pair (probably a very
old bird) was much amiss, the male appearing greatly distressed and
trying to induce her to feed. In the morning she was found dying
amidst some tall meadow grass ; the male meanwhile, intensely agitated,
and piteously calling, was engaged in keeping off some too inquisitive
Tree Ducks from the scene. On removing the body some regret was
naturally felt at having a rather valuable breeding pair of birds broken,
and great sympathy was extended to the pathetic little widower.
Concern, however, was entirely misplaced, as by 6 p.m. of the
same day he was happily wedded to the lonely little hen (a bird he
previously would not look at), and at the time of writing (1st June)
still continues by her side.

By H. Jones
Many people seem to find this deservedly popular bird very difficult
to breed and these notes are a resume of instructions I have sent to
various fanciers who have been exasperated by their lack of success
in their breeding attempts.
Stock .--It is essential that the breeding stock should be equal as
regards sexes. If there are more hens than cocks there will be no
serious mating. Even one extra hen can upset an otherwise tranquil
aviary. The best matings are old cocks with young hens. Cocks are
the deciding factor in breeding, for 99 per cent of hens will lay, hatch,
and rear young ; some 20 per cent of cocks will not take marital duties
seriously. The moral is, when you have a good cock who will build
a nest, help to hatch and rear the youngsters, and continue to feed
them while the hen is busy with second nest, you must value him
like the good bird he is and stick to him. I have cocks now in their
fourth breeding season and their progeny are quite healthy and virile.
The more pairs one has, without overcrowding, the better will be
the results. Single pairs are very rarely successful. The cocks seem

170 H. Jones--Notes on the Breeding of the Zebra Finch
to like the defence of their nests and favourite perches against the
intrusion of other birds.
Neither do Zebra Finches breed as well in mixed collections. As
soon as the young birds are able to feed themselves, remove them from
the breeding aviary. They are very mischievous and soon want a nest
for themselves. It is unwise to add even mated pairs to an aviary
where the stock have already settled down to serious work. The fact
that aviary-bred birds breed better than imported birds goes without
saying.
Aviaries .--I find that Zebra Finches do better in a large shelter shed
with a small flight than in the usual aviary with small shelter shed
and large flight. Heavy rain seems to be fatal to young birds, possibly
from the fact that they come from the rainless regions of Australia.
Food .--Staple foods are white millet, Indian millet, and spray
millet, all given separately. To each pint of white and Indian millet
I add one teaspoonful of cod-liver oil, mix thoroughly with the hands,
and allow to stand for twenty-four hours before serving. The tins
I mix the seed and oil in I scald out with boiling water after each
mixing. Since mixing cod-liver oil with their seed I have never had
a case of egg-binding. I lost some dozen hens before using the oil.
Canary seed I find too fattening. I give lettuce all the year round
and seeding grasses when I can get them. When the birds are breeding
they will take mealworms ad lib., and they seem to have a passion for
cuttlefish bone when they have young in the nest. So that they may
get it quicker, I cut off slices of cuttlefish, about the thinness of
newspaper.
When the young first start feeding themselves they eat nothing
but spray millet, so it is necessary to see there is always plenty of this
about where the young can get at it, i.e. on the floor. They seem to
find the other seed too hard to crack at first and many young Zebra
Finches seem to be lost at this age because they cannot get sufficient
spray millet.
Nests .--The birds will use anything, but I think the best nest is
a cardboard shoe or stationery box. Fasten the lid to the box and
bend about a quarter of the lid down as a platform. They like the
boxes even better if one-half of the aperture thus left is covered with

a piece of cardboard. These boxes have the advantage that, if they
are dirty, they can be destroyed and the local shoe-shop is only too
glad to replace them. 7 lb. paint tins, with a 2 in. square opening
cut in the side make good nests to hang from the roof, but if used
should be plentifully punched with holes for ventilation, otherwise
they sweat a lot. If the trade-made boxes are used, it is advisable
to make the entrance bigger, as I have seen the cock leave so much
hay hanging out that he and his wife have difficulty in entering. It is
essential to have more nests than pairs of birds, because the old birds
always take the youngsters to another nest when they leave the old
nest. This gives one the opportunity to clean the old nest or destroy
it, if too dirty. I always spray the nest-boxes with paraffin, as well
as the hooks and nails they are hung from. For nesting material I take
millet sprays after the birds have done with them, cutting them into
lengths 7 inches or so in length, leaving about 2 inches of the seeding
end on. Then, with a penknife, I slice these into very thin lengths.
The birds like this better than grass, as it is stiffer and they can weave
a very neat nest with it. I place a little hay at the bottom of the box
to form a foundation. I also spray this with paraffin. For a nest
lining I cut up wool into 1 in. lengths, and supply a little hair, etc.,
from packets of canary nesting material. If this is sprayed with
paraffin it has a wonderful and cleanly effect on the young birds'
plumage. A full nest of young birds can so soil a nest that their tail-
feathers are useless when they leave the nest and they are consequently
prevented from flying properly and their growth retarded at the most
important time. I find the nesting birds only like to line their nests
just before the young hatch. I am also convinced that it is fatal to
leave a lot of nesting material lying about the aviary. It tempts the
cock to start making another nest.
General .--King all the young birds. I use coloured celluloid
canary rings, of which there are some twenty colours. To further
prevent in-breeding, buy or exchange a few cocks from some other
breeder, or buy an imported hen or two. Very few imported cocks
settle down to breeding in an aviary. Beware of cocks who will not
build nests for their hens. They never take the matter seriously.
Also cocks who build nests for their own use are never good breeders.

172 Capt. S. Stokes--The Zoo at Mossley Hill , Liverpool
I have had one or two who did this and who had an aversion for the
society of hens. The Zebra Finch cock is a beautiful bird and is
ridiculously cheap. It seems a pity that his vagaries whilst breeding,
coupled with the hens 5 tendency to egg-binding, should militate against
their undoubted charm.
THE ZOO AT MOSSLEY HILL, LIVERPOOL
By Captain S. Stokes, M.C.
An estate of 15 acres, comprising house, well-matured and timbered
garden and paddocks, has been opened by its owner, Mr. H. E. Rogers,
as a Zoo. It is pleasantly situated on high ground overlooking the
River Mersey, and is about 3 miles from the centre of Liverpool, and
easily accessible from that city.
I spent a few happy hours there, walking about the lawns and
alleys and enjoying the birds and animals, and was astonished to hear
that over 60,000 visitors have done the same since the Zoo was opened
in the spring. People do not go there to deposit their wastepaper
and their orange-peel, but for rest and refreshment and education.
I was told there are already sixty season-ticket members.
In view of the British public's undoubted enjoyment of birds and
beasts well kept and well shown, it seems a little odd that new Zoos
which spring up should create such dislike and opposition in the breasts
of public officials in corporations and ministries.
Mr. Rogers demonstrates that it is possible to keep animals and
birds in quarters of moderate dimensions, as distinct from " natural
surroundings ", with perfect success. All his stock looked in good
condition as to feet and feather or fur, and this must ultimately be
the criterion of a creature's well-being and happiness in captivity.
Any shelter-sheds with floors of cement have sleepers of timber over
the concrete, and the larger birds' outdoor quarters are mostly floored
with ashes or sand.
An old orangery has been turned into a bird house, where I saw
a Spix Macaw and a Hyacinthine, various Conures, Amazon Parrots,
and Cockatoos. The compartment, with outdoor playroom attached,

was shared by three chimpanzees looking well and jolly. Next came
four aviaries with covered shelters and open flights, two occupied by
Waxbills and small Finches, one by Laughing Jackasses, Jays, and
Choughs, and the fourth by Doves. Here I noticed the beautiful
Bartlett's Bleeding Heart Pigeon, the Blue-headed Ground Dove of
Cuba, and Australian Plumed Ground Doves. Across the lawn was
a large aviary with rocks built up at the back, over which water flowed
into a stream along the front. Here were Flamingos, Ducks, and
Blue Porphyrios. A greenhouse with the roof lined with plywood
had made a very good reptile house, with glass cages down the centre.
These were heated by electricity cunningly concealed in perforated
natural logs. The reptiles looked well and lively. Close by were
pairs of lions, leopards, and wolves, all looking well.
In a range of small wire enclosures containing concrete shelters
were Emus, old and young, kangaroos and wallabies of three species,
bears and capybaras. Further along were Crowned Cranes, Pheasants,
Vulturine Guineafowl, and Curassows of several species. Yarrell's
Curassow struck me as being a very handsome sort, and being usually
tame would doubtless make a very good liberty bird for a garden.
There was also a large aviary with good cover of rhododendron clumps
in which were numerous Peafowl and four particularly good Brush
Turkeys.
An enclosure with a pond had Bar-headed Geese and Black Swans.
There is a cafe, pleasantly fresh and cool, where good cold food
is attractively served.

By Geoffery H. Clark
Life is made up of regretting lost opportunities, and I have never
ceased bemoaning the fact that I did not make better use of my time
in South Africa in studying the myriad bird life that goes to fill the
veld. Birds there were of every size and hue, but beyond learning
the local names (mostly Dutch, by the way) and in the case of birds
I wished for some reason to slay, their habits to a limited extent, I am

Geoffery H. Clark--Some Birds of the Veld
none the wiser ornithologically speaking, than when I went out. There
are just a few, however, who by reason of size, vieiousness, or value,
that I can remember a little about and perhaps an account of these
might be of interest to members.
The first one is the Secretary Bird. He will probably be so well
known that there will be no need to describe him. He is famous
for his habit of eating snakes, but from the halo that ignorant people
give him, one would think that his entire menu was composed of these
noxious reptiles. This alas ! is not so, and so far from being a hero
to be nationally lauded he is a villain of the worst type. There is
nothing he likes more than a brood of young Francolins or possibly
a nice, succulent leveret, and so all game-preserving men hunt him
to a standstill. This is not so easy as it might be, as the Secretary
is endowed with the proverbial cunning of a bagload of monkeys and
to bring about his ruin is by no means easy. It usually involves
long range rifle shooting unless one can find his roosting tree and lay
up for him. As I am pretty hopeless with a rifle, my bag of these birds
was limited to one, who for some unknown reason sat tight in some
thick cover and rose at about thirty yards in front of me when I was
carrying a twelve.
The Kafir or Crowned Crane may sometimes be seen stalking about
the veld seeking sustenance, and is sometimes mistaken by the tyro
for a Secretary Bird. That they both have crests may serve to heighten
this illusion, but the Crane is a much more slender bird and walks with
an airy grace that the more solid Secretary cannot achieve. Kafir
Cranes may sometimes be seen dancing, apparently from pure joie de
vivre , but no one as sinister as a Secretary could ever look on life with
such joyous abandon. Kafir Cranes are quite harmless and their
food--small reptiles and insects--causes no annoyance to anyone.
Herons of several types--I could never determine how many--
are common where there are any dams and ponds, and unless one has
fish that one wishes to preserve they too are quite harmless. They
are sometimes shot on account of a little clump of lacy feathers--
an aigrette is, I believe, the correct term--which they carry in the
middle of their backs, and with which ladies like to decorate their hats.
I was once cajoled into dropping a Heron for this purpose and when

we collected it, we found it was one of the non-aigrette-bearing types !
It served me right.
In similar localities to those favoured by Herons may be found
a curious bird called the Hammerkop, anglice, Hammerhead. It is
a smaller bird than the Heron, and carries itself more on the horizontal
than does the Heron. It is dull brown in colour and derives its name
from a curious arrangement of feathers on the back of the head which
gives it the appearance of a hammer. It is fish-eating and, unless
fish are wanted, quite harmless.
One of the most useful birds in the Union is the White Tickbird,
also known, I think, as the White Egret, but I am not sure about
this. As I said, my knowledge is purely local. Wherever there are
flocks of cattle, particularly in moister situations, there one may see
Tickbirds, standing rigidly to attention beside the beast they have
elected to attend to. Ever and anon they stretch their necks or make
a little flight and detach one of the pestilential insects from which
they get their name. There is a stiff penalty for killing one of these
and quite rightly so. The temptation to do so, however, is surely great,
for their pure white plumage would look very handsome if mounted well.
Sometimes one may see, high up in the air, looking like spots in
front of the eyes that originate from a faulty liver, a number of birds,
wheeling slowly round and round and ever and always descending.
They are Aasvogels or Vultures, the scavengers of Africa. As soon
as any beast falls sick and looks like dying the Aasvogels begin to
congregate. How they know, I could not say. I have heard it said
that, so high as to be invisible to human eyes, there are always these
birds, vigilantly scanning the veld with their telescopic eyes. They
are credited with the power of telling when cattle or horses are nigh
unto death, and then begin slowly descending, waiting for their intended
dinner to die. Sometimes they will attack him while he is still alive,
first tearing out his eyes and then slashing him to ribbons with their
terrible beaks. It is also said that within a certain range they cannot
see clearly as their eyes are attuned only to long ranges. Certain
it is that they always take a much longer time proportionately in
doing the last distance to the dying beast, which does look as though
they were hunting by scent.

Geoffery H. Clark--Some Birds of the Veld
I once came upon a company of them that had just demolished
a dead horse. They were so gorged that they could not fly, and just
lurched about with a queer drunken dignity. Upon a rock, a few
yards from his flock sat the King Aasvogel, supported ludicrously
upon an outstretched wing. The others reeled about uttering gurgling,
hiccupping cries. The place smelt like a charnel-house. In a spirit
of mischief I secured a catapult and flicked up the King as he sat on
his rock. He gave a loud cry of protest and tumbled off his rock and
straightway engaged in a violent quarrel with one of his courtiers.
They were too tight to do each other much damage, however, and
nearly overcome with the stench, I left them to it. Later that day
they were gone. They will not eat any animal that has been struck
by lightning as even they cannot stomach the sulphurous taste of
such meat, but apart from this they will clean up any carcase. As
such they are useful beasts and are protected by the Government.
Very different is the Lammerfanger (Lamb-snatcher) which is a
species of grey eagle. These pestilential birds cause great havoc
among the young lambs, but as they are very capable of looking after
themselves, do not fall a victim to powder and shot as often as could
be desired. I once secured one who was sitting on top of a thorn bush
waiting a favourable opportunity to steal one of our lambs. It took
me nearly half an hour to stalk within the limited range of a twelve
for which I had nothing greater than No. 6, but it was worth it from
all points of view.
As well as the Lammerfanger, there are many sorts of Hawks,
ranging from the Kestrel, which is very similar in size and colour
to our bird of that name, up to the big 6 ft. Eagle Hawks. After
the Kestrel comes the Grey Kestrel. He is little bigger in size but
looks more like a Wood Pigeon in colour, being grey and white. He
has a wicked red eye. Neither of these two is particularly harmful,
but occasionally they follow the example of their larger cousins, the
Brown and Grey Chicken Hawks, and steal chicks. I must confess,
however, that to me the only good Hawks are dead Hawks and I
usually attempted to deal faithfully with them.
Owls there were a-plenty, from the Great Horned Owl down to one
who so strongly reminded me of our noxious Little Owl that I always

made him an excuse for burning powder. There was also a large white
and brown-flecked owl that locally bore the name of Barn Owl. I
think it is very very similar to our Barn Owl, but the passing of time
has rather dulled my memory for the exact plumage of birds,
particularly those I never had occasion to shoot and I could not be
too sure whether he was the exact counterpart.
Among the smaller birds the one that fascinated me the most was
the Flop-tail or Sakaboola Bird. He was in body about the size of
a Blackbird and just as glossily black. Over the shoulder he carried
a bright scarlet patch flanked with white. His chief claim to notoriety
was, however, his long tail, which frequently ran to 15 inches.
It was not stifi like that of an old cock bird, but soft and wavy, and
when the bird was flying with the wind it would blow underneath him
in an attempt to overtake its owner. In winter, however, they would
shed this appendage, and their scarlet shoulder would turn orange
and their general sleek blackness would become a rusty green not
unlike the hue of an undertaker's frock-coat. During the heavy summer
rains they would become so waterlogged in the tail as to be catchable
by hand. They have a loud and penetrating " Cheep ! " which goes
through and through you. One elected to come and serenade me
one hot February day when tempers get frayed. Try as I might with
stones and curses, I could not shift that bird. He would make a short
flight round the kitchen garden where I was working and then would
return and set up this awful noise again. Finally in sheer desperation
I got an air rifle and mirabile dicta, I hit him.
Crimson Cardinals, or, as I have heard them called, Bed Bishops
(this seems the opposite of promotion both in adjective and noun),
are common objects where there are reeds. In company with their
relatives the Yellow Fink (Finch ?) and sundry nameless birds much
resembling Sparrows, they live in hundreds in such places. While
being unable to place them ornithologicaliy, I should hazard the guess
that they are related to the Weavers as they build a most marvellously
constructed nest the shape of a gourd out of grass and attach it to a
tall reed. W T hile beautiful to the eye, they are a rare old nuisance to
the corn, and thousands must be shot annually by exasperated farmers
armed with dust-shot.
One of the commonest birds in our district was what we used to

call tlie Sprew (Spreo ?). It was all black except just under the tail
where it had a large white patch. They used to go about in hundreds
and do much damage to fruit trees, always, with true avian cussedness
picking the best, taking one bite and moving on. Related to this, if
local nomenclature can be trusted, was the Green Sprew. This was
truly a beautiful bird, far less common than the other. It was about
the size of a Blackbird and in colour a wonderful peacock green which
in some lights looked almost electric blue. Round the throat and
neck (as far as memory serves) there were feathers which would look
a rich purple if turned in certain ways. A much prized bird from a
feminine point of view, but difficult to secure, and from a masculine
point of view not worth the securing.
There is a bird out there called the Cuckoo, but I have never been
able to find whether it is the one that comes here. I did not see one,
but frequently heard them, and their note is merely a " Cuck ", the
" oo " being omitted. Whether our bird alters its note when it migrates
south or not I could not say. I expect the name is wrong.
Certainly the bird we called the Skylark is not the bird which
made Shelley earn the well merited curses of many generations of
schoolboys. It seems to lead a very aimless existence. It climbs
aloft to an incredible height in dead silence, and then having choked
back the last " Excelsior " emits a loud " Cheeeeeee ", and on this
note it descends to earth again. The lower it gets the lower the note
gets, so that it sounds rather like a dying pig. It then rests a moment
or two and starts afresh.
Among birds known in England are the Hoopoe, very common
indeed, the Crow, fairly common (but no Rooks, thank goodness),
and, of course, many Swallows and Swifts during the time when they
have migrated from England.
It is true that South African birds have practically no song, but
they are all capable of a bewildering variety of loud noises. They
usually emit these either on the wing or from under cover. They do
not for the most part sit on the highest point of a tree and pour out
a melody as do our birds at home, for the very excellent reason that
long before they had reached the first repeat bar the air would be
black with raptores, attracted by the noise and the accessibility of
the singer.

By The Rey. J. E. Sweetnam
The Editor's recent plea for more contributions from members
must be my excuse for this account of the breeding and rearing of a
British hybrid which, though somewhat rare of its kind, hardly comes
within the scope of the Societies' activities. Nor can I myself claim
any special knowledge or experience in this direction, the breeding
of this hybrid having come about through the inclusion of a few British
birds in a mixed collection of Foreign Hardbills in a small outside
aviary--which, by the way, is built on the ancient ramparts of this
old town (Taunton), part of which form the eastern boundary of the
Vicarage garden, and of the two ancient parishes of St. Mary Magdalene
and St. James.
I have had both parents for some three years. The hen Chaffinch
was aviary-bred, and is so tame that she flies to the wire whenever I
approach the aviary and follows me about for mealworms. Last year
the same pair hatched out three young but, unfortunately, I had to
leave home that very day, and all died before my return for lack of
proper attention and feeding. As last year, the nest was built in an
ordinary canary nest-pan hung on the outside wall of the brick shelter
(a converted outhouse) and sheltered from the elements by a piece of
zinc. This year there was only one fertile egg, which did not increase
my prospects of success in rearing, but I left the other three eggs in
the nest for a few days and the hybrid has suffered no ill-effects from
lack of companionship in the nest. Incubation commenced on 17th May,
the young was hatched on the 29th, and left the nest on 11th June.
I took the precaution of placing the hybrid in a cage with the door
open, where the mother continued to feed it (the sex is not yet evident),
until the attractions of the larger world drew it into the aviary, where
it is now very much at home, and still making such insistent demands
on the mother that I wonder what would have happened had she
produced triplets, or even twins. Apart from an occasional and casual
inspection of the nest the father took no interest in the proceedings,
and made no attempt to feed his strange offspring.

For the benefit of the other inhabitants of this aviary, a number
of which were rearing young at the same time, a varied assortment
of soaked and dry seeds was available, with green food and seeding
grasses supplied daily, but what surprised me most of all was that, for
the first week of its separate existence, the hybrid was fed entirely
on mealworms. About the sixth day I saw the mother feeding with
soaked hemp and rape, and I think she also used a very little milk
sop. If ever the supply of mealworms ran out the fact was notified
immediately by the noisy excitement of the hen and the unseemly
language of the hybrid. For the first few days the mother was very
careful to break up the worms before feeding, but later she supplied
them whole, often two or three at the time, and the number of meal-
worms that gawky youngster managed to put away was astonishing.
Both parents are already showing evident signs of wanting to go to
nest again and, now that I " know the ropes ", I hope to be able to
rear all that hatch out but, if all have the same penchant for meal-
worms, I will have to consider buying them wholesale or breeding the
unpleasant things myself !

I am afraid that I have been very remiss of late in regard to writing
any avicultural notes, but what with ill-health and other things my
birds have had to take a second place. Unfortunately, illness has
compelled me to part with a great many of my birds, including many
old favourites, which has been a great wrench. I contemplated parting
with all my birds but kept delaying the evil day until at last it was
decided that though I must part with the majority several of the old
favourites must be retained, so with a nucleus of about twenty or more
birds I am on the way to another adventure into the realms of
aviculture. First of all, I couldn't bear to part with my Pittas which
were every one's favourites as well as my own, and secondly, a certain
gentleman in New Zealand whetted my appetite by sending me certain

rarities from that part of the globe, including five Norfolk Island
Parrakeets, so I suppose that in a few months' time I shall finish up
with about as many birds as I had before.
The present chapter mainly concerns birds which for the most
part have passed into other hands.
Not having had a great deal of garden space at my old house,
owing to a very badly laid-out garden where I could not erect aviaries
for breeding purposes, I was somewhat restricted in the species which
I kept, though my people would no doubt say otherwise ! But having
moved some time ago into a house where I had an orchard of over
half an acre at my disposal I was freer to choose my birds, but once
having made a choice I was reluctant to change. The rarer exotic
softbills have always been the birds I have kept and even now they
still continue to be my favourites. True, they are a great deal of
trouble and can never be left to the tender mercies of an employee
no matter how much he may evince a liking for birds. So owing to
my brother's being equally interested in my feathered family I have
not been so tied as I should otherwise have been, for all foreign softbills
require unremitting attention, as only those who have kept them can
testify.
In the following chapter I offer the reader a few notes on a few of
my rarer birds, whose acquisition was an event in my avicultural
career as they are seldom seen in the market and only upon rare
occasions offered for sale.
The Abyssinian Coucal or Lark-heeled Ground Cuckoo
To the ordinary man in the street and perhaps to a great many
bird-keepers the word " Coucal " may mean anything, so I think
it is better to give these birds their old though rather cumbersome
name, the " Lark-heeled Ground Cuckoos," which at once places them.
Though their relationship with the real Cuckoos is not so apparent
from a skin, the general demeanour of the live bird at once places it
in near relationship to the Cuckoos proper.
Not a great deal has been written about these strange semi-
terrestrial Cuckoos for they have never been common subjects in
aviculture, being only very occasionally brought to this country, and

consequently they do not get the attention which they deserve. I doubt
whether outside the Zoological Gardens there are many in private
hands.
More than one species has been bred in captivity, which I think
is a rare feat.
The majority of the Coucals live in Africa, where they are found
inhabiting the dense undergrowth close to the rivers and other damp
and swampy places. They are extremely agile on the ground and run
with great rapidity, looking very much like large chestnut-coloured
rats when quickly threading their way through the grass and reeds.
They are also very active in the trees and when put up out of the grass
will rapidly mount to the top of the nearest tree by a series of quick,
bounding jumps. When at the top they are difficult to observe owing
to their breasts being of a very light colour.
I have seen a great deal of these birds at liberty in Africa and have
made a study of several species which came under my notice. As
I mentioned before they are seldom seen far away from swampy and
marshy places, where they hide in the dense vegetation.
The plumage in all species is very light and soft in texture like that
of most Cuckoos, and unless the birds are handled very carefully the
feathers soon come out. Most species have a brilliant ruby-coloured
eye. Coucals are quite nice aviary pets providing they are kept
with such birds as the larger Jays, Pies, etc., for they are dangerous
with small birds, in fact in a wild state they supplement their diet of
insects, etc., with small birds and mammals. In captivity they readily
eat such things as small mice which they swallow whole, and live
fish, etc.
Coucals have a great variety of strange calls which rather resemble
those of the tropical American Cuckoos. Their usual call is a kind
of bubbling noise like water running out of a narrow-necked bottle.
These calls are extremely loud and can be heard from a great distance
owing to their penetrating quality.
An Abyssinian Coucal which I have at the present time growls
exactly like a cat if one goes too near to it. This bird, an old favourite,
was given to me by Captain Hammond and is perhaps one of my most
striking birds. At first he was shy, not knowing whether to make

friends or not, and now after several years, though perfectly tame,
he always needs a little coaxing and talking to before he will take
a mealworm from one's hand. He is very gentle and the only time
one sees him in anything approaching a temper is when he is holding
his own against a pair of Jay-thrushes but in the end he always has
to give way to the combined efforts of these two determined birds.
Cory," for that is his name, is seen at his best when trying to
intimidate the Jay-thrushes. His large, fan-like, metallic green tail is
spread to its full size and the beautiful chestnut wings are spread so
that they almost meet in front of the breast, while the loose, light
plumage is puffed out. In fact he then looks quite a formidable
adversary.
This bird is easy to keep ; in fact all the Coucals are. A good
insectivorous food, minced raw meat, a small dead mouse on occasion,
and a few mealworms keep him in fine condition. Cold he cannot stand,
so we bring him into the bird-room from his outside aviary as soon
as the first nip of winter is in the air.
Coucals are beautifully shaped birds, reminding one of Touracos,
but unlike these birds the body is held horizontally.
The brilliant ruby eye with its black eyelashes give the bird a quiet
and dignified expression which is in keeping with his nature. In the
outdoor aviary we have a heap of twigs in one corner through which
the grass grows, and in this the Coucal is very much at home, creeping
in and out during the whole day.
Two Coucals with which I was familiar in a state of liberty
were Burchell's Coucal (Centrops burchelli) and the Senegal Coucal
(C. senegalensis). The former bird is practically terrestrial and lives
in the long reeds and grasses in the swampy valleys of Portuguese
East Africa, where it is more often heard than seen, owing to its very
striking call. The latter bird is more arboreal and is seldom seen on
the ground, but frequents the mimosa trees by the rivers and swamps.
In a wild state I believe these birds feed to a great extent upon
caterpillars.
The White-crested Jay-thrushes
Not a great deal has been written about these extraordinarily
handsome birds, but one sees almost as soon as they come into one's

possession that they belong to the great order of the Timeliidse or
Babblers, though in appearance they differ a great deal from the rest
of the order, but their demeanour at once places them. Ever active,
cunning, inquisitive, very intelligent with the eye always on the main
chance, these birds seem to have a close affinity to the Jays. Though
dominating all the other birds in the aviary even though they be twice
the size of the Jay-thrushes, they are not aggressive or bullying, always
keeping to themselves but allowing no interference from any other
bird.
Few birds are more adapted for aviary life, easy to feed, hardy,
beautiful even though possessing no brilliant colours, and very
affectionate towards each other, to the extent that one woman
remarked, " Them be real true Christians, mister, they be so fond of
each other! "
About the size of an English Jay but with a more slender beak,
these birds are for the most part a very rich olive brown with a golden
sheen, the head, crest, and upper breast is snow white tinged with
grey on the nape ; the head is heavily crested with long, loose feathers
which blow about in the slightest breeze. A jet-black stripe runs
from the base of the beak through the eye to the nape, a combination
of colours which make these birds perhaps the most striking of an
extraordinary family. Their cries, which are typical of the Babbler
family, are not harsh and unpleasant. If a cat happens to be seen
around the aviary the noise and commotion made by the birds is
terrific. They put the rest of the inmates in a state of tension for hours
afterwards. The Timeliidse are by nature watchmen, and in the wild
state very little escapes their vigilant eyes. Should some carnivorous
mammal appear on the scene the whole of the bird population for miles
around is warned. Sometimes when a party of Babblers have
discovered me in the forest or jungle, their cries have been enough
to waken the dead, and bird watching has had to be abandoned for
a great part of that day.
One of the strangest episodes in bird life which I have ever known
concerned a pair of these birds.
An exceptionally fine pair of these birds, which I still have, by the
way, lived during the warmer months in an outdoor aviary inhabited

by various Jays and Pies. These Jay-thrushes had very little to do
with any of the others except to chase them away if they came to the
feeding-pot first. But one day I purchased a pair of Swainson's
Long-tailed Jays, which, after a time, I placed in the aviary. The
Jay-thrushes seemed spellbound. They followed them about every-
where and just stared at them in the most amazed way, in fact they
became the Jays' second shadows. After a time the Jay-thrushes
ventured to touch the other birds, very timidly and gently at first,
like a child touching something it was afraid of. Gradually they
touched the birds all over, occasionally bursting out into the loud,
rollicking laugh which causes these birds to be known as Laughing
Thrushes, and jumping over the Jays' backs they would stare and
touch them on the other side. At times they sit and look, with head
on one side, with a rapturous look like a lovesick maiden looking at
the photo of her beloved. All day long from morn till night they just
followed the Jays and gazed at them in a state of rapturous ecstasy.
After a time, one of the Jay-thrushes grew rather tired of this and also
not a little jealous of her mate ; if she saw him gazing in the old lovesick
way she would jump in between the two, start to preen his feathers,
and gradually push him away. He then began to realize that his mate
was jealous and disapproved of this strange state of things, so he began
to follow the Jay about surreptitiously. If his mate wasn't looking
he would gaze in the old lovesick way and perhaps sidle up and gently
preen the feathers of the Jay's head, but as soon as he saw his mate
had seen what he was doing he would pretend he wasn't doing anything,
and sometimes make himself smaller and hide behind the jay, but
his wife would find out and immediately come on the scene, get in
between the two, and gradually push her mate away. I have never
seen rapture expressed in a look such as with these birds. What
prompted the Jay-thrushes to behave in this way I cannot say unless
it was the huge crests of the Jays which fascinated them ; I am sure
it was no sexual impulse for the birds always kept a few inches away
and never attempted any familiarities such as feeding the other birds,
etc. ; it just seemed as though the Long-tailed Jays had cast a spell
over the other birds. The Jays seemed to take very little notice of
their attendants, in fact they very seldom resented it. They seemed

The Snowy Egret

<bodyText confidence="0.99978535483871" page_id="56222026"  page_num="186" year="" vol="">
If I were asked what I thought the most beautiful thing in the world
I would say a Snowy Egret, that lovely embodiment of grace and
purity, an ethereal creature of soft, supple curves and dazzling whiteness.
But if any reader of this chapter seeks out one of these birds in a
zoological garden or elsewhere and sees a bird which has been in close
confinement he will be sadly disillusioned. For to compare a captive
Egret with a wild one is like making a comparison between a typical
London " charlady " and " Venus de Milo ", for a Snowy Egret after
it has been in captivity for any length of time and fed upon artificial
food, soon loses its grace and " tightness ", the dazzling white plumage
gets soiled, and the bird takes on a very dejected demeanour
When seen beside its native swamps and rivers, nothing more
lovely can be imagined, especially in the breeding season, when the bird
is a mass of filmy nuptial plumes, which alas ! have cost so many
millions of birds their lives. These are known as " ospreys " in the
plume trade, which is not quite so dead as we are led to believe. The
plumes grow from the top of the head, the base of the neck, and the
upper back, and when the bird is displaying the whole body seems to be
enveloped in a mist of these beautiful feathers.
There is really only one way in which to keep these lovely creatures
and that is in a state of semi-liberty ; in a large walled garden or at
least in one which has a wire fence all round where the birds may
wander with one wing clipped so that they cannot fly away. There
the birds will find a great deal of their own food such as worms and
various insects and it is there that one can see him as he should be,
a fairylike creature of surpassing grace and purity.
To those who are not familiar with this bird I would say that it is
a very small Heron, with a body not much larger than a good-sized
Pigeon, with a long, curving neck and long black legs and pale green
feet, the whole of the plumage being of a dazzling whiteness.
As visions fade with the passing of youth there remains in the

storehouse of memory one scene which will never fade. It is as fresh
now as when it was only just impressed on the brain: the picture of
a colony of Egrets by the side of a smooth-flowing, translucent, lotus-
river. I would that I could convey to the reader a picture of that
scene but no pen, brush, or camera would ever be able to catch the
peaceful atmosphere of the haven of quietude.
The river wound in snake-like curves, smooth, deep, and oily green,
between the banks of tall green rushes and mimosa trees laden with
their fragrant blossoms. The surface of the river itself was covered
with the still more fragrant blue lotus lilies. A quiet peace enfolded
it all and each evening with the coming of the swift tropical twilight
a thousand fairy-like forms w~ould gather winging their way with light,
buoyant flight from all quarters to rest upon a spreading mimosa tree,
which with the weight of the birds and the undermining influence of
floods had partly fallen and hung at an angle over the slow-moving
river.
Here the birds could be seen in all the glory of their filmy nuptial
plumage, unsullied by any spot or mark of dirt. How ethereal they
looked in the green twilight and the bright tropical moonlight. I used
to think of how many such another scene as this there had been until
the plume hunters had found it out and taken their bloody toll and
only a few decaying and mangled corpses and dead young told their
pitiful tale.
Blue Hunting Pies
Excepting the Bird of Paradise, the lovely Pies of the genus Urocissa
are perhaps the finest of the Crow-like birds, and while they are not
uncommon in the aviaries of amateurs in this country they are not
as well known as one would wish. The expense and accommodation
needed are deterrents to the popularity of such large birds, for, besides
being fairly expensive to purchase, they require a good-sized aviary
to themselves unless kept with equally large Pies or Jays, and if one
wishes to breed them then they certainly must be kept alone.
The Occipital Blue Pie has been bred on two or three occasions,
and I considered myself fortunate some while ago in being able to secure
a very fine pair of aviary-bred birds which came to me in beautiful

condition and perfectly tame. These birds were considerably larger
than any imported ones I have seen. The British Museum Catalogue
gives the length as 24 inches. The tails of these birds measured over
20 inches, so it will be seen that they are much larger than the average
bird.
Few birds are more active and restless than these large Magpies
being continually on the move, and for that reason it is a pity to confine
them to a small space. These handsome creatures have all the traits
of their smaller English cousins, cunning, alert, inquisitive, and with
the eye always on the main chance, very little in the way of food
escapes their eyes. They are fond of bathing and keep their wonderful
plumage in perfect condition.
A pair of these fine birds in an outdoor aviary planted with natural
trees and bushes never fail to attract the admiration of every visitor.
I have never found the birds aggressive to birds of their own size,
but they will not hesitate to kill and eat any small bird which they can
get hold of.
Owing to their noisiness it is a mistake to keep the birds too close to
the house as I know to my cost for when the birds spy a passing cat
or dog the noise they make is enough to waken the dead and not only
that but all the other Pies and Jays join in. That noise heard at 4 a.m.
on a summer's morning is not conducive to put one in a good temper
for the rest of the day, and often one's neighbours have something
to say as well!

Your note asking members to send their experiences however
simple has made me feel that perhaps a small success of mine may
be of interest to some of the members with small aviaries. Mine, as
you know, is only a converted bedroom, but I have been lucky enough
to get my Firefinches to breed and bring up one youngster. The

terribly. I kept her by the living-room fire for some weeks, leaving
a well-backed up fire at night. She became quite tame, flying about
the room, and gradually her cage door was rarely shut. Every after-
noon she took her siesta in the hearth and so determined was she to
get there that she would return repeatedly if shooed away.
Very early in the spring I secured a mate for her, and they both
went up to the bird-room. It was only a few weeks before I saw the
cock carrying feathers about, and they built a nest in a branch of a pine-
tree I had hung on the wall. The nest was like a Wren's, but they
never lined it or used it. Whether because I looked at it, although
I did not touch it, or because a Pintail Whydah did I do not know ;
but they built another high up in a big lettuce-crate I had painted
with solignum and filled with soft hay, as a bedroom for the smaller
birds. The nest was in the side, and absolutely hidden by branches
across the end. The cock knew I could provide feathers, and he would
take them off my shoe. He was so insistent that my pillow is quite
thin. Shortly he disappeared. He sat nearly all day, and the hen
sat at night. During the time they were sitting the Pintail had to be
caught; it was difficult and very disturbing, but they were not too
upset and sat again as soon as all was quiet. About thirteen days
after I first noticed the cock disappear I noticed the hen very much
more interested than usual in looking over soil I had carried up and
in the mealworms. I started to grub hunt at once, and wrote off for
gentles and by great good fortune a friend had a lot of bran that had
gone maggotty. These white grubs were devoured. I went into the
woods and found numerous grubs and little caterpillars by tree-roots
and under the hedges. I carried them home in soil and the Eirefinches
weren't two minutes picking them out. These with cut-up mealworms
and soaked seed and much seeding grass kept them going till the
gentles arrived. Unfortunately the cock Canary developed a passion
for gentles and mealworms and I had always to provide two dishes far
apart, as he would stand over them with wings outspread shouting
that they were his. I gave them some dainty every two hours. At the
end of the second week or even perhaps a little before, they began to
fail a little in their interest. *1 thought also Mrs. Firefinch did not
brood at all night or day. I was sure the baby or babies were dead.

I did not hear that cheering sibilant sound, but I made up my mind
I'd bear it till I began to smell something bad. I went about utterly
miserable, and then I was given some ants and their eggs. By standing
with my ear glued to a crack in the door I at last heard that joyful
sound of the young being fed again ; probably I had only missed it,
as in the whole three weeks I never saw the cock or hen visit the nest.
Any way, the ants stimulated them to great efforts in feeding, and the
ants were most obliging, taking up their abode under a tuft of grass
and laying eggs daily I think. I used to move just a little grass at a time,
and keep the other ants for another surprise another day.
In a mixed collection even as small as mine feeding for young is
difficult, as the dainties are appreciated by more than the parents.
Three weeks and a day after the baby hatched it left the nest--
bigger in build than either of the parents, perfectly feathered, and
tight in feather. The two little phosphorescent spots by the beak were
very noticeable. At first it went often to the nest and slept there at
night; and then one night I saw it between its parents roosting and
quite grown up. The parents started to mate again before it left the
nest, and on the third night that it slept out the hen dropped dead
from the perch in the night. I felt terribly sad. She was my favourite
bird. Mr. Hicks found egg trouble, possibly caused I think by the day
turning suddenly exceptionally cold when I was out, and a great
hail-storm coming after a warm morning.

in March, 1932. When in full colour it is wholly black, but
when I saw it there was the usual out-of-colour tinge of brown.
In shape it is something between the father and mother, tail
short, bill cream white, with no shade of bluish as in the
father. No red or yellow anywhere. The bird was bred in
1926, so is now six years old ; it is a cock and has tried to

almost " no possible shadow of doubt, no possible doubt
whatever ". In another division of the same aviary was
another Munia hybrid, which the owner believed to be a
Three-coloured Mannikin X Chestnut, though the parentage
was uncertain ; it was certainly some Munia hybrid, quite

A CUCKOO AS A PET
It may interest some members to hear of the keeping of a
Cuckoo. It was taken in June, 1931, and has been in my keeping for
just a year. It was very easy to feed, taking most food offered, such as
bread and boiled milk and all insect food, especially crickets, of which
a large quantity breed in the greenhouse. It is a very timid bird and
dislikes strangers, but is quite tame with those it knows, and feeds
from the hand if offered any nice food. During migratory season it
was rather upset and I kept it covered up for a few days and fed on
raw meat. Then it was put into the warm greenhouse and evidently
thought it had reached its warm winter quarters, and was no further
trouble. It loves a spray and sits on a table opening the wings and
swaying to and fro to get really wet, a most amusing sight. It flies
about my bedroom for an hour every day, and is a lovely bird to see,
having pretty markings on the neck and lovely long wings and tail
rather like a hawk. Quite an interesting bird to keep--it tries to
say " Cuckoo " but has not got it quite right yet.

In compliance with a request from Dr. Hopkinson for details
of hybrids and other birds I have hatched and reared in cages and
aviaries, I have much pleasure in giving the following details which
I hope will interest members.
Having lots of spare time through war disabilities I bred quite
a number of small foreign birds and had many successes in hybridizing.
This was done more for my own knowledge and amusement than with
any idea of records for scientific purposes. Now that I belong to the
Avicultural Society I find such notes and records would have been
interesting to our members. Unfortunately I can only find scant
notes made at the time. My detailed notes of the plumage markings,
sexes, months of hatching, etc., were recorded in my canary breeding
records book which has got mislaid or lost. Many of these successes

and what became of some of these hybrids was recorded in Cage Birds
of 20th September, 1930.
In 1925 and 1926 I reared quite a number of Cape Canaries, Green
Singing Finches, Yellow-rumped Serins, Zebra Finches, Bengalese,
Common Grey, Orange-Cheeked, St. Helena, and Cordon Bleu Waxbills,
as well as a nest of Linnets and Goldfinches.
In 1927 I mated a Cock Yellow-rumped Serin to a hen Boiler Canary
which produced three young, all having the yellow rump of the cock
and various other yellow and white markings in the plumage. Cock
Green Singing Finch was mated to a hen Cape Canary, 4 young reared.
These were pretty hybrids, showing the markings of both parents.
They were all strong, vigorous birds, with excellent vocal powers.
Cock Brown Linnet was mated to a hen Cape Canary. One young reared
--a hen--which strongly resembled the Linnet, except that it had
greenish yellow breast markings.
In 1928 I mated a Cock Common Grey Waxbill to a hen St. Helena
Waxbill. These hatched and reared a cock and hen, which I exhibited
at the Crystal Palace Show in 1929. This same pair again nested
in 1929 and reared 3 young. These were also exhibited at the Crystal
Palace. One pair of these birds went to Miss Bousfield and the other
three to Gamages.
In the same aviary a cock Common Grey Waxbill mated to a hen
Orange-cheek Waxbill, reared 2 young, which were also sent to
the Crystal Palace, but died upon arrival. A cock Brown Linnet mated
to a hen Green Singing Finch, three young reared. These three strongly
resembled the Linnet, except they had brighter yellowish green breast
markings.
A cock Cape Canary mated to a hen Green Singing Finch, two
young reared, strongly resembling the Cape Canary cock, with bright
yellow markings.
A significant fact was, that these hybrids showed most of the male
parent's plumage, except in the Waxbill hybrids whose colouring
was more evenly blended.
A hybrid Yellow-rumped Serin cock was mated to a hen Boiler
Canary which laid five eggs, one of which was fertile, but did not
hatch.

All the Finch hybrids were excellent songsters, especially the Yellow-
rumped Serin cross, but I found them all, except the Waxbills, very
quarrelsome in the aviaries. Cage Birds published what became of
most of these hybrids, and I believe some of them are still alive.
In addition to the above I also reared nine Goldfinch X Canary
hybrids.

A CRIMSON-MASKED CONUKE

<bodyText confidence="0.991225307692308" page_id="56222039"  page_num="199" year="" vol="">
It may be of interest to your readers to hear of my experience
with my pet Crimson Masked Conure, which I brought from Genoa
three years ago, who lives in a cage in my room (or rather on the cage),
and goes into it when I tell him. Last August he escaped out of the
window, and after an absence of three months he was eventually
caught by the means of hanging his cage filled with apples on the tree
he was on ; he was just eating the last apple on the tree, and it fell to
the ground. During the three months I frequently saw him in different
orchards and talked to him, but he always flew away when I got closer
to him than he cared for ! He is finger tame, and often sits on a bush
when I am gardening. The thunder-storms and gales did him no
harm, and he came back in better condition than when he left me.

BREEDING VIOLET-EARED WAXBILLS IN SOUTH AFRICA

There is a note in the May number of the Avicultural
Magazine by M. A. Decoux re the successful breeding of the Violet-
eared Waxbill (Granatina granatina) in Germany.
M. Decoux mentions that he thinks that this is the first time this
species has successfully reared its young in any aviary.
Out here, these birds breed regularly with at least three
aviculturists.
Normally they are single brooded, but become quite prolific in
captivity, more especially aviary-bred specimens.

In April last, I sent two pairs of aviary-bred Yiolet-ears to
Germany, and I am sure the owner will have no difficulty in getting
them to go to nest.
I may mention, that it would be practically impossible to successfully
rear young without an abundance of live insect food.
We in South Africa are fortunate in having an inexhaustible supply
of termites (Eutermes trinervius) at all seasons.

There appear to be a good many aviculturists in this country who have
realized the value of the Gouldian Finch in captivity and the ease with
which it may be kept and bred when treated correctly, and all of these will
have read with great interest and gratitude Mr. Teague's exhaustive article
on the subject, which has been reprinted in pamphlet form. It gives many
hints and tips of the greatest value to all who keep, not only Gouldians, but
any of the ornamental Finches and Waxbills. I hope that members will
purchase this pamphlet to give to their friends and so help to broadcast the
correct treatment of these lovely birds. It contains a coloured plate showing
both the red- and the black-headed phases, and is to be had post free from

By J. Delacour
For the past two or three years, I have had the good fortune to
Beep at Cleres all the species of Sheld-ducks, South American Geese,
and other closely allied birds, with the exception of the Antarctic
Goose (Chloephaga hybrida), a sea-dwelling bird, feeding on seaweeds,
which so far has proved impossible to keep in confinement beyond
a few weeks or months.
They are all, to my mind, extremely attractive, most of them
possessing beautiful plumage and fine shape. Practically all species
are hardy and more or less inclined to breed in parks or paddocks.
In his first volume of the Check-list of Birds of the World, Mr. J. L.
Peters, of Boston, rightly puts the South American Geese [Chloephaga),
its close relation, the Abyssinian Blue-winged Goose (Cyanochen), and
the Australian Maned Goose (Chenonetta), close to the Brent (Branta)
and Hawaian Goose [Nesochen), but, curiously enough, he places the
Tree-ducks ( Dendrocygna ) between them and the Orinoco and Egyptian
Geese, and again Sarkidiornis (Oomb-ducks), Cairina (Muscovy),
Asarcornis, and Coscoroba, between the latter and the Sheld-ducks
in the middle of which one is surprised to find the Australian Freckled
Duck (Stictonetta).
I am not going to discuss classification in this magazine, but for
good reasons I believe that the Tree-ducks, on one side, the Comb,

J. Delacour--Notes on South American Geese,
Muscovy, White-winged, Hartlaub's Ducks, Cotton Teal, Pigmy Geese,
Mandarins, and Carolinas on the other, form two quite homogenous
groups, very distinct from other waterfowl, while the Coscoroba Swan,
Freckled Duck and Pink-headed Duck each stands quite alone,
without any close relatives.
The Cereopsis, from Australia, is to my mind allied to the South
American Geese, but distantly, and represents a very old type of
Goose without much specialization. If we include it in the scope of
the present paper, there is little to say about it which is not already
known. I always keep a couple of pairs of these fine birds, which
require very little water but plenty of grass. They are extremely
pugnacious and, unless kept in a very large park, must be given a
separate enclosure. They would kill any Goose or any of the smaller
Cranes. They usually lay their eggs in the winter ; the goslings
much resemble the Magellan's, but are larger. They are very easy
to rear, either with their parents or under hens.
The South American Geese ( Chloejphaga) all come from the colder
parts of South America and migrate more or less widely. They are
all rather terrestrial in their habits, and also very spiteful to one
another. Only in very large parks, like that of Woburn Abbey, can
many pairs be kept together, and under such conditions they may be
full-winged as they are generally good stayers. But even then there
may be murders in the breeding season. I keep them in separate
paddocks, or only one pair in a large garden or enclosure with other
Geese of different genera, which, as a rule, they do not molest too much.
They only need enough w^ater to be able to bathe. I find the best way
to breed them is to let the female sit on her eggs, then to remove them
to an incubator a day or two before they hatch and to rear the goslings
under hens. The parents will, however, rear them successfully them-
selves if allowed to. They need a lot of green food from the
beginning and are not difficult, growing very rapidly.
Since last year I have had two pairs of the lovely Andean Geese
(\0x25A0 C . melanoptera) from the high, cold plateaux of Peru, Bolivia, and
Chili. They are very amusing in their ways and quite tame, the
males inclined even to attack one. One pair are separated in a large
paddock, while the other one is free in the park, and so far they do&apos;

not bully other birds. I have great hopes of breeding them next year.
The first and only breeding success was that of the London Zoo during
the War. Quite a number of pairs were imported last year by
Fockelmann of Hamburg, and Mr. Blaauw bought several also.
The Magellan or Upland Goose ( C . picta, according to Dr. Hell-
mayr) is the best known of the genus. I am quite convinced that
the so-called dispar is but a colour phase, in which the male has a black
barred instead of pure white breast, the females always being identical.
This fine species is very easy to breed and a great ornament to any
garden. For the last twenty-five years or so I have always kept a pair
or two, and bred them regularly. It is distributed throughout the
southern parts of South America and the Falkland Islands.
The Euddy-headed Goose (C. rubidiceps), from the Falkland
Islands, is a pretty little bird, rarer and more delicate than the previous
one, but hardy enough and not difficult to breed as a rule. Personally
I always had bad luck with them and never bred one ! I have now
several pairs, some being young imported birds. This year a pair
produced eggs but they were destroyed by Crows.
The Ashy-headed Goose (C. poliocephala), a very handsome
bird from the extreme south of the Continent, is quite easy to breed
and ought to be much more popular than it has been so far. It is
hardly larger than the Euddy-headed and both sexes, as in all species
but the Magellan, are alike. But it is always easy to tell the male in
any species of this genus by his larger size and whistling voice, while
the female has a harsh cackle. From one pair bought from Mr. Blaauw
in 1920 dozens have been bred here, from three to twelve every year,
in spite of all the birds in Europe belonging to the same family.
The Blue-winged Goose ( Cyanochen cyanopterus), which inhabits
the high plateau of Abyssinia only, is very similar in shape and ways
to the South American Geese. It has only a rather flatter bill and
a slightly graduated tail. It resembles the above Geese in every way,
but has a funny way of sinking its neck in the feathers of the mantle.
The female has a softer voice than most of the group ; the male
whistles. They are rather spiteful, but I have kept my breeding pair
for several years on the lake with hundreds of other waterfowl and
they do not seriously molest them. Another pair, in a large field,

J. Delacour--Notes on South American Geese,
proved rather vicious to Sheld-ducks. The goslings are more delicate
than in most species, reminding one of Sheld-ducks in their require-
ments. I bred three this year. I believe these Geese require a large
garden or park, with plenty of water, to be induced to nest. I found
them perfectly hardy and more aquatic than Chloephaga.
The Maned Goose ( Chenonetta juhata) is a lovely diminutive of
the above genera, very confiding and nice in its ways. Although they
resemble the above-mentioned Geese in their shape, these birds are
quite different in many ways : the female displays to the gander,
in moving her neck to one side and calling, like Sheld-ducks and
true Ducks do, and she nests in holes in trees. This species is quite
harmless but rather uncertain in its breeding dispositions. I never
bred any, although I have had two or three pairs for many years.
But they have several times bred in captivity and Mr. Ezra had two
broods this year.
We now come to birds with broader and flatter bills.
The Orinoco Goose ( Neochen juhata) is a pretty and quaint
bird from the hot parts of South America, where they live on the banks
of the large rivers. They are not very aquatic in their habits and
do not prove quite hardy, being susceptible to cold, damp nights.
Although I have kept some for many years in the park even in winter, it
is better to shut them up at night during the cold season. They have
often been bred, especially by Mr. Blaauw, but none ever laid an egg
with me. For the last few years they have been regularly imported
from Para. The male has a rather pretty whistle and is very amusing
in his display ; the female has a loud quack and displays like a Sheld-
duck. They are very fussy but not really vicious, and can be associated
to most Ducks and Geese.
The Egyptian or Nile Goose (Alopochen cegyptiaca) is a very
common African bird, and also very common in Europe where it breeds
freely. The male has a curious husky voice, but the female quacks
loudly ; they are very spiteful to Geese and Sheld-ducks. The chicks
resemble young Sheld-ducks.
I keep in a pen a curious semi-albinistic male in which all
normal colours appear as very pale ; it is a handsome bird. I put an

ordinary female with him but so far they have not bred. This Goose
crosses easily with Magellans, etc., and Sheld-ducks. A hybrid between
this species and the Orinoco Goose was bred in the London Zoo some
years ago.
The Sheld-ducks ( Casarca ) are shorter in their legs and both
sexes have resounding--although different--voices. Their bills are
also flatter and slightly turned up at the tip. They are extremely
spiteful among themselves and to small Geese, and it is better to keep
each pair separate or associated only with smaller Ducks of which
they take no notice, or much stronger birds such as Swans. As far
as my experience goes, they breed much better when they enjoy semi-
liberty in a large garden or park with plenty of water, although they
have often been bred in small enclosures. The young ones are reared
like Geese, but require rather more animal food. But both adult
and young need much grass and other green food.
The Buddy Sheld-duck ( C.ferruginea ), which is found throughout
the south and east of Europe, North Africa, and Asia, is by no means
rare in captivity and breeds freely. I have reared young years ago,
but now only keep one female paired to a Bajah Sheld-duck and
producing every season interesting hybrids.
The South African Sheld-duck (C. cana) is a little smaller,
much prettier and rarer than the Buddy. Up to five years ago they
were extremely rare in Europe, when some pairs were imported to
Holland and England. I then procured several but lost some and
in 1930 was left with one drake and two ducks. The Berlin Zoo,
where some had been reared that same year (as well as at St. James
Park), sent me one drake as an exchange ; paired to an imported
female and let out on the lake, they produced eight youngsters in
April, 1931, six of which were reared to maturity under a hen. It is
remarkable that this drake has bred at less than a year old. This
year six eggs were first laid in March out of which three young were
reared, and again eight in April, which we mistook for Common Sheld-
duck's, and three more were bred. Pairs put in large enclosures, with
good-sized sections of the river flowing through, did not nest. Up
to recent years this species was considered as impossible to breed in
captivity ; I believe it requires plenty of space. These birds are not

too spiteful and do not really bully other birds, with the exception
of the other Sheld-ducks, though they do not appear to mind Common
Sheld-ducks (Tadorna).
The Australian Sheld-duck (C. tadornoides) is perhaps the
handsomest of all. It has been imported now and then, but so far
never bred. I have now a fine acclimatized pair. They are very
pugnacious and must be kept separate.
The Paradise Sheld-duck ( C . variegata), from New Zealand,
is also a fine bird, especially the female with her pretty white head
and mahogany-red body. An extremely vicious species, to be kept
separate or with small Ducks that it does not mind. Before the War
I bred them in quite a small pen and it has been also kept thus in many
Zoos or collections. Now, although I have had three fine pairs for
several years kept in large enclosures, one even at liberty in a 50-acre
deer paddock, I never had an egg from them !
The Rajah Sheld-duck [Rajah rajah) is a peculiar and very
handsome bird, the rarest of all in captivity. I have had two males
in my garden for six years and found them altogether harmless and
hardy. One would have paired to an Orinoco Goose, while the other
one has mated to a Ruddy Sheld-duck and produced so far five hybrids
with her. They completely disregarded female Common Sheld-ducks.
These drakes have a soft whistling voice like the Common Sheld-duck.
My second male is now paired to a hybrid female of 1931, and I hope
to breed three-quarter blooded birds next year and so gradually come
back to pure Rajah, as I believe my birds are the only ones in confine-
ment and hopes of getting new imported ones are remote. The hybrids
have the shape and size of the Rajah ; they are dark red in colour
with white neck and head, the latter having a light brown patch on
the top ; bill and feet greyish flesh colour.
The Common Sheld-duck ( Tadorna tadorna), of Europe and Asia,
is too common and well known to be dealt with in detail here. I always
keep two or three pairs on the lake and find them harmless, good
breeders and extremely ornamental.
Finally, I shall mention the lovely Pseudotadorna cornuta, from
Corea and Eastern Siberia, only known by three skin specimens, either
exceedingly rare or extinct, but kept in Japanese gardens until last
century.

By G. H. Gurney
The Chinese or Russet-tailed Bamboo Partridge (Bambusicola
ihoracica) is closely allied to Fytch's Bamboo Partridge (B. fytchii),
but while the latter is found in the north-eastern parts of India the
Russet-tailed Partridge is confined to southern China. A pair of these
very showy and attractive birds came into my possession in June, 1931,
but made no attempt at breeding last summer, though they very soon
settled down and made themselves at home in a good-sized enclosure
where there was plenty of cover and long grass and, contrary to so
many species of Partridge and Francolin in confinement which are
often so terribly shy and wild, my birds from the first were always
delightfully tame and confiding, seldom hiding themselves but generally
scratching amongst the turf in the flight of the aviary, which is kept
mown. From the following description of its plumage it will be seen
that this species is a particularly showy bird for a Partridge : the
colours are well contrasted, and the male when freshly moulted is quite
a smart fellow. Top of the head a rich umber brown, with a few
rufous spots ; the forehead and lores a beautiful blue grey ; back
of the neck brownish grey, shading into pale olive brown on the rest
of the upper parts ; the wing-coverts finely spotted with large chestnut
blotches, margined with black and buff ; lower back, rump, and upper
tail-coverts dusky; tail, chestnut; chin and throat, bright chestnut ;
breast grey, marked with black and chestnut; rest of the underparts,
pale buff. The sexes are almost identical, the plumage of the male
being rather brighter, and he is a slightly larger bird than the hen.
They appear to be perfectly hardy and able to withstand any amount
of cold. On 26th May this year the female was missing, and from the

days later the nest was located behind some faggots, concealed by
long grass, the hen sitting tight, the cock generally on guard in the
near vicinity of the nest, very ferocious now, and dashing at any other !
bird that ventured too near. Five eggs were laid : they were of a
creamy white colour, thinly spotted with brown spots which were
larger and more numerous at the big end of the egg. The eggs hatched
on 7th June and in a very few days the young were following the old
ones round the aviary, catching flies and searching for insects in the
grass ; they were beautiful little things, richly marked and spotted
with deep brown. Luckily the weather was then fine and warm,
and the young throve apace ; we fed them for the first ten days entirely
on ants' eggs, but they gradually got on to the ordinary biscuit meal
and egg food all the gallinaceous birds have here. Small mealworms
were eagerly devoured, and it was a pretty sight to watch the young
ones rush to their parents to be fed on some tit-bit which the latter
had found. The brood was generally divided, half the young ones
going with the male, the remainder with the hen. Now, 1st August,
the young ones are nearly as big as their parents ; and the hen has
laid another clutch of seven eggs which have been put under a Bantam.
As I was not quite certain of the identification of this species I sent
the male up to the South Kensington Museum, where it was identified
by Dr. Percy Lowe from the series of skins there. He writes " Your
Partridge is without any doubt Bambusicola thoracica thoracica of
Temminck."
An interesting account of this Partridge is given by Mr. K. Swinhoe
in The Ibis for 1863, vol. v, pp. 400-1. He writes : " A pair of
immature birds (B. thoracica) were brought to me on the 16th August,
1861. They uttered a continuous loud, fowl-like scream . . . This
and the Foochow Bamboo-fowl are of very similar habits and notes.
This species is found throughout all the hills of Formosa, generally
scattered about the bush, never in coveys. It is very pugilistic, the
males and females both singing the same loud cry, beginning with
hilly-hilly, and ending rapidly with he-put-hwai, which is so powerfully
uttered that it may be heard at a great distance. They are not easily
flushed, lying so close to the ground that you may walk over the spot

whence the noise appears to come, and rarely put up the bird. Each
pair selects its own beat, setting up, frequently during the day, the
challenge note ; and woe betide any other Partridge that encroaches
on the forbidden ground ! They both set on him at once and buffet
him without mercy till he takes to his heels. This pugnacious pro-
pensity often meets, as perhaps it deserves to do, with an evil fate.
The Chinese fowler listens for the challenge and sets on the disputed
hill a trap with a caged decoy within. The decoy is trained, and sets
up a reply. The lord and lady of the manor rush to the spot, and run
recklessly into the trap and are caught. The captives are taken to
the market and sold as cage-birds, the Chinese having a great love
for the horrible screeching cry that this bird is incessantly sending

forth."
I do not think that this species has been previously bred in
confinement in Great Britain.
[According to Dr. Hopkinson's Records the species was bred in
Paris in 1868.--Ed.]
TRIALS OF AN AVICULTURIST
THE AMERICAN BLUEBIRD (SI ALIA SIALIS )
By N. Nicholson
So much having been written of this species in the past that I feel

<bodyText confidence="0.998908333333333" page_id="56222057"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
that, in relating my experiences, there may be a possibility of trespassing
on the space of our magazine. However, I will leave this to the
discretion of our worthy Editor.
Towards the end of March my hen Bluebird, which I had wintered
indoors (the climate in this particular district being anything but
genial), showed unmistakable signs of wanting to nest. The cock
Bluebird, who had wintered indoors also along with the hen, clearly
showed that he was not averse to sharing in the good work. The
hen shuffled round in the corner of her large flight cage and, upon
being given some moss, was not long in conveying to me that she was
intent on the propagation of her species. The cock frequently fed
the hen, which I knew was a good sign.

N. Nicholson--Trials of an Aviculturist
I decided to turn them out of doors and allotted a spacious, well-
sheltered aviary to them. Several nesting receptacles were hung up
around the interior, and it was most amusing to watch them surveying
the different nesting sites offered. First one receptacle was over-
hauled, each bird holding a kind of conversation as to whether it was
suitable or not, and then another. This consultation was carried on
for about an hour and finally a box, similar to a Budgerigar nesting
box, was chosen.
Nest-building soon commenced, and within a few hours of being
turned out into the aviary quite a lot of hay and raffia had been placed
in the box. The cock took no part in the building of the nest but sat
on a bough serenading his wife with his song and continuously flapping
his wings.
In due course the nest was completed and pairing took place.
Pairing was a noisy affair, the cock, before and after, singing and
flapping his wings.
Being anxious to rear at least one pair and knowing the eccentricity
of this species in captivity I decided, when the eggs arrived, to take
the advice of one of our well-respected members, who has had con-
siderable experience in breeding bluebirds, to place them in the nest
of a wild Robin and hand-rear at twelve days old.
Here was a problem--to find such a nest, being rather early for
Robins nesting in this particular part. By mere chance I met a friend
who lives in the same vicinity and he casually remarked that he had
a Robin's nest in a shed in his garden. Arrangements were quickly
made and the eggs transferred. The wild Robin's eggs were placed
under the Bluebird, as I was determined to give her a chance of rearing
young. In fact I felt rather guilty in changing the eggs but consoled
myself with the knowledge that if the young were reared by
her she would certainly be entrusted with her own offspring in
the future.
All went well and after fourteen days' incubation the Bluebird
and Robin hatched young. Previous to the young arriving I had
made provision for a good stock of gentles, and placed an order for
a supply to be brought every three days. I had a good stock of blue-
bottles also. The first day passed over and things were progressing

favourably, the hen Bluebird, I occasionally noticed, feeding the
young.
I did not molest the wild Robin but was content to observe that
the young Bluebirds were receiving her attention.
At this point I may say that each bird laid four eggs and hatched
four young respectively.
On the third morning, after replenishing the stock of gentles,
I was grieved to see the cock Bluebird fly up to the nest, in the absence
of the hen, who was off feeding, and deliberately take one of the young
out of the nest and convey it in his beak around the aviary before
finally killing it with a sharp stroke of the beak. I immediately went
to examine the remainder in the nest and found they were doing quite
well. Here was a problem, and what could be done ? After much
thought I decided not to interfere but to hope for the best. The cock
Bluebird took all the young out of the nest and killed them in turn.
However, I had the consolation of knowing that the young Bluebirds,
being reared by the wild Robins, were progressing favourably.
All went well until the sixth day on the evening of which I paid my
daily visit, only to find that a cat had discovered the young and I
suppose made a hearty meal of my precious young Bluebirds.
After a period of a week I observed the hen Bluebird carrying
nesting material into another box. Hope springs eternal in the human
breast and I still had visions of young Bluebirds eventually being mine.
Within another three days a nest was completed and in due course
four eggs were laid.
Not being able to locate a wild Robin's nest I decided to let incuba-
tion commence. After ten days of incubation I received a telephone
message from a friend, 30 miles distant, to the effect that he had been
successful in locating a Robin's nest which was situated in a loose
stone wall far away from the madding crowd, and I could rest assured
that the eggs, should I decide to transfer them, would be quite safe.
Here was another problem, how to transport eggs 30 miles which
had been incubated for ten days. However, I decided to attempt it.
As a precaution I got a wooden box which was filled with vegetable
down (a material something akin to cotton wool) and placed a hot
water bottle inside to raise the temperature as near as possible to that

of a small bird. The temperature right, I placed the eggs carefully
amongst the vegetable down and drove out to the particular place
where I met my friend who conducted me to the nest.
After transferring the eggs I remained a little while to see if the
Eobin went back to the nest, which she eventually did.
After fourteen days' incubation I drove through to make a personal
inspection, and was pleased to find that three young Bluebirds had
hatched.
I made arrangements for my friend to keep me posted with informa-
tion as to how things were progressing and decided to take the young
at twelve days and hand-rear them. Unfortunately it was not to be.
When the young were seven days old there was a violent storm with
a torrential downpour of rain lasting for a whole day. Fearing the
worst and having had no word I decided to drive out and, to my dismay,
upon arriving, met my friend who had just been to the nest to
investigate, and had found the young Bluebirds dead and the nest
soaking wet. The nest was situated in a loose stone wall near the top
and immediately above it two stones joined with an aperture of about
3 inches. Consequently the rain fell right into the nest and the water
drained down into the nest from each side of the stones.
Approximately a fortnight later the hen Bluebird was busy once
again carrying nesting material, and chose the same nesting box as
previously. The nest was soon completed and five eggs laid. Having
in the meantime located a Eobin's nest in the same area as the previous
one I decided to adhere to the advice already mentioned. The laying
of the wild Eobin and Bluebird exactly coincided. The eggs were
transferred and the wild Eobin's eggs placed under the Bluebird as
I was still anxious for her to have another attempt at rearing young.
Leaving the wild Eobin's nest with the knowledge that the Eobin
had apparently accepted the Bluebird's eggs by her quick return to
the nest, I felt that young Bluebirds were going to be mine after all.
Curious to relate, the Bluebird refused to accept the Eobin's eggs as
a substitute for her own and finally deserted the nest.
The day following I determined to drive out and see if everything
was in order at the other nest. Imagine my surprise, on approaching,
to find that all the Bluebird's eggs were broken, and lay just outside

the nest. One egg, however, at first sight seemed little the worse but,
on closer examination, I found that it was pierced--no doubt by the
beak of the Robin. You can imagine my feelings once again.
Being in need of an aviary for a pair of Parrot Finches which were
quickly coming into breeding condition I decided to separate the
Bluebirds. The weather being rather cold at this particular period,
I eventually decided on keeping the Parrot Finches indoors for a little
longer. Very shortly the hen Bluebird was as eager as ever to go to
nest again. I was rather opposed to this, but very quickly came to
the conclusion that if I did not accede to her request, in all probability,
despite the fact that the cock Bluebird was not within hearing of her,
she would certainly deposit some eggs in the corner of her large
flight cage.
Very little food of a stimulating nature had been given for quite
a long period, but this did not seem to make any difference to her
ladyship.
After careful thought and, knowing that as far as nineteen eggs
in one season had been laid by the hen Bluebird, I decided on giving
one more chance which, although against my wish, was all I could do
under the circumstances.
I turned the Bluebirds out into their original aviary and nesting
operations began immediately. This time a straw hat was chosen,
fixed up in the same manner as for Parrot Finches, a good illustration
of which appeared in the magazine for the month of March.
It was quite amusing to watch the hen Bluebird perch on the
edge of the hat and suddenly drop down and disappear. In three
days the nest was completed, hay, raffia, moss, and horse-hair being
the materials used. Five eggs were laid.
Not having been able to locate a Robin's nest suitable I had no
alternative but to let the Bluebird go on incubating. All went well
and after incubation had taken place for twelve days I received a
message from the friend mentioned previously that he had located
another Robin's nest in the same area as the two previously,
and as far as he could say, incubation had been in progress
three days.

in advance of the wild Robins and due to hatch within two days.
However, I decided to act immediately and transfer the eggs.
A Hedge Accentor's nest was discovered in the same area also,
and I decided, for experimental purposes, to place one egg in this nest
and place the other four in the Robin's nest. The eggs being duly
transferred my hopes ran high once again.
After watching both the Robin and Accentor go back on to the
nest I came back home.
The next day I drove out to make an inspection, and imagine my
feelings once again, on approaching the Robin's nest, to find all the
eggs of my Bluebird broken and outside of the nest. The beak marks--
of the Robin I have no doubt--could be seen quite clearly on one egg.
My thoughts were now centred on the Hedge Accentor as the only
hope of rearing at least one Bluebird for the season 1932. Upon
approaching the nest the bird flew off and, on inspection, I was amazed
to find her own three eggs in the nest but that of the Bluebird had
vanished. I was not long in finding the egg, it being in the bottom
of the hedge, broken, immediately under the nest.
On arriving home I decided to separate the Bluebirds for this
year at least, and hope for better things next season if they still remain
in my possession.
The questions arising from my experiences are as follow
Had the wild Robins in the two latter cases colour sense, and did
they know that the blue eggs of the Bluebird were not their own ?
In the case of the Hedge Accentor the egg resembles very much
in colour that of the Bluebird but varies a little in size. Did the Hedge
Accentor know the difference in size ?
In the last instance also, was it possible that the wild Robin (she
having only been incubating for three days as against twelve days
by the Bluebird) had the instinct of knowing, from the movement
of the young Bluebirds within the shell, that her eggs could not be so
far advanced ?
In the small area where the Robin's nests were located to my own
knowledge there have been at least twelve broods of young reared to
maturity, which I think rules out the question of vermin destroying
the eggs. The particular place is miles away from even a village

and scarcely a human being, other than a farmer here and there, is
ever seen, so one can safely rule the human element out.
I am perfectly sure that this beautiful species would be com-
paratively easy to breed if a hole was cut in the wire netting of the
aviary when the young hatched, and the parent birds allowed full
liberty of a large garden to occupy their time in searching for insect
life for the young.
As I only had one pair I thought it rather a risk to take, but should
I ever attempt to breed Bluebirds in the future I shall certainly take
the risk.
Should any member desire anything exciting in the way of aviculture
I can recommend the breeding of Bluebirds and finding wild Robin's
nests under which to place their eggs.
I can guarantee him an abundance of excitement and, furthermore,
venture to state from experience that he will not sleep much.
A FEW TIT-BITS ON PHEASANTS
By P. J. Lambert
I was pleased to see Mr. Beever's article on Pheasants. I quite
agree with many of his remarks. It does seem a great pity that more
parks and zoos do not erect a few aviaries for Pheasants. How rarely
one sees fancy Pheasants except in private collections. Now what
is the more beautiful and inspiring, a few aviaries of Pheasants or a cage
of ugly little monkeys ? One could almost compare a bush of wild
roses in full bloom to an aspidistra plant! Monkeys may amuse
children but surely God's more beautiful creations are more uplifting
to the mind of a child. I also with my friend Beever would willingly
give a few Golden and Silver cocks to any Park Committee who wished
to start a collection. Most certainly a club should be formed, and this
would be the very best method of increasing the number of fanciers.
Poultry shows would be encouraged to give us a class, but I do not
think agricultural shows would be suitable as these are generally
held at this time of the year and most of the Pheasants are in full
moult and look a sorry crowd.
Mr. Beever's list of the most striking and beautiful Pheasants is

P. J. Lambert--A Few Tit-bits on Pheasants
to my mind wrong. He places them : 1, Satyr Tragopan ; 2, Amherst;
3, Golden; 4, Peacock Pheasants ; 5, Edwards ; 6, Reeves. What
about the Impeyan and Elliot ? I would suggest : 1, Satyr or
Temminck Tragopan ; 2, Amherst; 3, Chinquis Peacock Pheasant;
4, Impeyan ; 5, Elliott; 6, Golden or Swinhoe. But then I am not
sure that our common Blackneck does not deserve a place in this list.
Examine him closely and I think many will agree with me. Mr. Beever
mentions a Temminck Tragopan cock which I have here. This is
a remarkable bird. It was dispatched by Mr. A. Hampe from Shanghai
and was beautifully packed and in wonderful condition when it arrived
about last November. It walked out of its crate as sedately as though
it was just emerging from its shelter. In a few weeks it became the
tamest Pheasant I have on my place and what is very remarkable,
in this its first spring in our country, it has been most fertile and I hope
to rear some of his progeny. Is it not exceptional for a freshly
imported Pheasant to be fertile in its first year of importation ?
It is certainly difficult to rear Tragopans. I am convinced that they
require small insects ; ants' eggs are to my mind the ideal food, meal-
worms and maggots they are very fond of but these are dangerous
and cause purging. Also, give a Pheasant chick mealworms and one
has great difficulty in persuading them to eat other foods. If only
Pheasant hens would become more broody in captivity half our troubles
would be over. I am now watching from my window an Amherst
hen which hatched six chicks last Friday ; incidentally, there were
no dead in the shell. She spends her whole day finding her chicks
minute insects. When any danger threatens she gives her chicks
a very sweet high-pitched whistle and they are under her before one
can say " knife I have just gone out and thrown a tennis ball in her
direction and hey presto ! they are " non adsum ". Try and take one
of her chicks away from her and she becomes a veritable virago. They
are a perfect delight to watch.
Now Mr. Beever suggests that Tragopans do not get sufficient
exercise and goes on to say: " Perhaps if some large aviaries were
built on a hillside over some rocks and boulders they would get plenty
of exercise." He also says : " This may be sheer nonsense." Well!
he has said it ! Why not build a miniature Himalayan mountain and

to ensure the birds having sufficient exercise encircle this mountain
with a banked cinder track. Messrs, damage would fix us up with
a clockwork imitation of a mealworm and this would be fixed to travel
round our track at express speed with Tragopans in the wake of our
mealworm. We should then hear such expressions as " Come on,
Satyr ! " " Temminck leads ! " " Cabot is in front ! " " No ! Blyth
has won by a beak." The lordly Impeyan cock would be our judge.
But, to be serious, I do not honestly think that the trouble lays in
lack of exercise. Tragopans are naturally lazy birds. Give them
plenty of fruit and tender green food and you will be rewarded with
fertile eggs.
I cannot say I have noticed Swinhoe's addicted to crooked toes.
I have had here some dozen pairs and I never remember one with this
fault. But if they have this failing surely it is a result of inbreeding,
for although Messrs. Rogers and Chapman frequently import such
breeds as Tragopans, Impeyans, etc., I have never been offered imported
Swinhoes ; the obvious conclusion is that most of our Swinhoes are
probably related. My trouble with Swinhoes is that the male so
frequently kills his mate and no device seems to prevent this tendency.
I have found this spring to have been a bad one for fertile eggs in
fancy Pheasants, but it has been a splendid season for rearing. I think
the principal cause of the infertile season is that we had such a very
cold early spring, and is it not conceivable that the hen's ovaries
become so to speak " chilled " ? I have not had a single egg from
four Reeve hens, and I hear from three friends including Mr. Beever
that their experience has been similar to mine with Reeves. On the
other hand I have reared (touch wood !) sixty-seven Blackneck chicks
from a pen of one cock and four hens, surely a satisfactory result.
I have recently hatched a Specifer Peafowl chick from an egg sent
from the Zoo. This little chick is really most amusing : nothing it
likes better than riding on its foster-mother's back. Whenever the
hen calls, it jumps down, swallows the tit-bit, then hops back again
to its perch. The hen resisted this at first but now seems to have
become reconciled. Speaking of the Specifer Peafowl, surely this is
the most beautiful of all birds ; it is of course a Pheasant, so perhaps
we had better head my list as above with this most gorgeous bird.

218 J. Carlton Hunting--Notes on Bornean Fireback Pheasant
Splendid news from Mr. Hampe that Golden Pheasants are still
comparatively common in their native clime.
What a delightful series of Pheasant articles we had from the
pen of Monsieur Delacour last year. Our Editor frequently gives us
some delightful little paragraphs on small birds ; I am sure he could
sometimes give us a few notes on Pheasants. Should any member
desire to keep a few Pheasants I wish they would write me ; what little
knowledge I have is at the disposal of any member who cares to write.
Although, as Mr. Beever truthfully says, they are delightfully easy
birds to keep, have extremely small appetites, and are a constant
source of pleasure.

GREAT MISSENDEN

By J. Carlton Hunting
We have been, this year, for the first time successful in obtaining
fertile eggs from a pair of Bornean Crested Fireback Pheasants (Lophura
ignita) and hatching out chicks from them. The pair were strong
specimens, bred in 1930, and like all our other Pheasants during the
whole year live in open pens with small lean-to shelters. They mated
about 1st April and we had our first egg from them on the 24th May.
There were ten eggs in all, similar in size, colour, and shape to an
ordinary 1J oz. hen's egg but the shells are hard and with a particularly
smooth and shiny surface. The hen laid irregularly, sometimes every
day, but at other times missing one, two, and three days without
laying, and ceased laying and wanted to sit after producing her tenth
egg. We had, however, taken the eggs away as they were laid and
substituted dummies.
The first two eggs set on the 31st May were fertile but the chicks
were dead-in-shell. On 8th June we set four more eggs under a cross-
bred Silky-bantam and in twenty-four days hatched out three chicks,
the fourth egg having a chick dead-in-shell. One of the three chicks
however, was very weak and almost from the first showed signs of
debility by hanging its wings and not being nearly as lively as the other

two. This chick finally died on the seventh day, although it was
running about and feeding fairly satisfactorily till nearly the last
moment. The other two are still doing well. The last four eggs
we set under a game Bantam hen on the 10th June and after the same
number of days, namely twenty-four, she hatched out three fine strong
chicks. Again, one chick was dead-in-shell. These three up to the
present are flourishing.
We find that during the first three days these little Bornean chicks
scarcely ever appear from under the hen and when they do they seem
to require no food. They do quite well at first on hard-boiled egg
and fine scalded biscuit meal. As a drink they have milk before them
from the time they are hatched and should this turn sour during the
day it does them no harm. After five days they have added to their
diet some fine, chopped green food, including dandelion leaves, lettuce,
buttercup leaves, young kale and chives, also a few scalded maggots
are given twice a day. One has to be careful not to overfeed on maggots
as apparently the little chicks like them so much that they will go on
eating them until their crops become distended, which of course is
harmful. Just about ten maggots a chick twice a day is, we consider,
sufficient, especially when they are still small.
For safety's sake we rear the little birds in a wired-in run in front
of the hen-coop which is shifted on to fresh ground three times a day.
As the little Bornean Pheasants always seemed to be scratching on
the ground after insect life, we tried giving them daily a few shovelfuls
of old leaf-mould which we found in the corner of our kitchen garden,
and in this they seemed to revel as it was chock-a-block with spiders,
earwigs, beetles, wormlets, and other edible matter which they devoured
with great rapidity and relish. Also a few handfuls of an ants' nest,
thrown down to them occasionally, they are very fond of, at once
devouring the eggs, pupae, live ants and anything else they can find
in it to eat.
At the present time, on the 29th July, we have two four-weeks-old
Bornean chicks under the one hen and three chicks, eighteen days old,
under the other hen, and they are all doing well and growing rapidly.
We certainly hope to be successful in rearing them to maturity. They
are very shy of strangers and amazingly strong on the wing.

THE BREEDING OF A HYBRID MACAW IN
NEW ZEALAND
By A. Anderson
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996582" page_id="56222068"  page_num="220" year="" vol="">
Several years ago I obtained a Red-and-Yellow Macaw. About
seven years ago I obtained a Blue-and-Yellow Macaw direct from
Brazil, when it was just a baby, not more than four or six months old.
After getting it thoroughly acclimatized it was put into an outdoor
aviary where it has remained ever since with the Red-and-Yellow
cock bird.
Last January the hen, the Blue-and-Yellow, laid two eggs on the
floor. I did not anticipate that these eggs were fertile, but out of
curiosity collected the eggs and put them away in a tin. In February
the hen laid two more eggs, also on the floor. I thought then that
there was a chance of the eggs being fertile and, to prove it, put a box
in a corner on the floor of the house portion of the aviary, the box
itself being 18 by 10 by 4 inches deep. I put plenty of sawdust in
this box and placed the January and February eggs in a hole in the
centre.
Immediately the hen went to nest, sitting very closely on the eggs.
I did not make a note of the date as I really thought nothing would
come of the efforts of the pair.
Imagine my surprise, however, when on the 17th March, 1932,
one young one was hatched out. This bird was fed by both parents
on the usual seeds I gave them, mixed sunflower, peanuts, sweet
biscuits, and plenty of fruit such as apples, bananas, grapes, green
maize cobs, and occasionally bread and milk.
The young bird prospered right from hatching and surprised me
by its extraordinary rapid growth. In all my forty years of bird
keeping I have never seen a bird grow as fast as this young Macaw.
I have much pleasure in forwarding you a photograph of this young
one together with an infertile egg, and you will notice that it is standing
in a soft mass of refuse, sawdust, peanut shells, etc., It was five weeks
old when this was taken.
At two months the young bird was almost fully grown, the wings
were well developed, the back bluish green, underpants red and yellow,

the beak similar to the cock bird's, red and yellow. The eggs are very
much like those of an Amherst Pheasant in colour and size.
After the young bird hatched out the hen chewed the nest box
almost to pieces and made a hole in the ground in the corner of the
house, over 1 foot deep and the young one was put in there, where
she kept it until it was about two months old. Now, four months
after hatching, the bird is entirely independent, and in vigorous health.
Before the Macaw went to nest they were exceptionally quiet
and I could handle and play with them as though they were kittens.
However, since they commenced to think of a family they have both
become so savage that I have to be very careful in getting into the
aviary to feed them and, I assure you, exceptionally careful when
retiring, so that I expose no unprotected parts.
Next year I propose sinking a small cask into the ground and filling
this with chips of wood and sawdust as it seems to me this type of nest
would suit the natural inclinations of the hen.
I trust that this account of an unusual hybrid will interest members.

BREEDING THE BLUE-AND-YELLOW MACAW
IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA

<bodyText confidence="0.996696" page_id="56222071"  page_num="221" year="" vol="">
By M. T. Padbury
About ten years ago I purchased in London two Blue-and-Yellow
Macaws (Ara ararauna ), said to be one year old, and sent them out to
Western Australia by boat in care of a man engaged to attend to them.
I have kept them in a roomy cage with a cement floor.
It was eight years before they laid any eggs. In November of 1929
the hen bird laid three eggs on the floor of the cage. Thinking the
cement would be too cold we gave her some straw which she pushed
away. We also gave her some sand. There w~as a period of four or five
days between the laying of the eggs, and she continually sat on them.
At the end of five weeks after the laying of the third egg we examined
them and found one fertile and two not so ; by this we knew the birds
were really a pair.

Three or four weeks afterwards the hen started laying again and
laid three eggs. She was not interfered with this time, there being four
or five days between the layings. She sat for about five weeks and
hatched one bird, which lived only for two days.
Before the next laying season I constructed a new cage, 10 feet by
12 feet and 12 feet high, with a cement floor, having a corner of 3 feet
square of sand only, and 3 or 4 feet deep.
In December, 1930, the hen bird started laying again. She laid
three eggs on the sand patch prepared for her, digging down somewhat
with her beak to make a hollow. She laid three eggs, there being an
interval of three or four days between the layings. After the third egg
was laid she sat on them between four and five weeks, and hatched
two young birds, there being one or two days between the hatching.
The young birds were very helpless and just lay in the nest of sand,
more like frogs than birds and there being only the appearance
of skin without any down. It took several weeks to alter this
appearance, although they grew very quickly. A grey down and
tiny feathers began to appear on their backs, but they remained helpless
for quite two months and were fed by the old birds until they were
three or four months old.
They gradually got the same plumage as the parent birds, and at
six or seven months old began to call out with the native call, and also
to talk in the acquired language the same as the old birds, such as
" Good morning ", " Good-bye ", 44 Hulloa ", whistle, and call the dog
and such things.
The following year, 1932, we had the same success, and have now
two pairs of Macaws which we have reared.
We kept a record of the last pair--the first egg was laid on
10th December, and the second on the 14th, 1931. The first one was
hatched on 4th January, and the second on the 7th, 1932.
I consider the success of the hatching of the eggs lay in having the
depth of sand for them to nest in.
We feed them on bread and milk for the morning meal, toast, fruit,
or lettuce-leaves midday, and nuts and sunflower-seed in the evening.
When the birds are young we feed them on bread and milk midday
as well.

The three forms, red, black, and the very occasional
yellow-headed, all interbreed, but no intermediate phases
ever appear. According to Neunzig (p. 371) all the forms
were once obtained in Australia from a pair of Black-heads.
De Brisay (Insectivores . . . Appendix, p. 266) says that
Gouldians, both red and black-headed, were first imported
to London in 1855 and bred in France for the first time by
Comely in the following year ; very soon Delaurier, Ollivray,
and many others followed with successes. In the United
Kingdom the first breeder of the red-headed form was
Phillips, says Fillmer in his Waxbills, Mannikins, etc., but
I have no first record for the Black-heads, nor know whether
this preceded Phillips's or not. Many (or rather most)
Gouldians never show any sign of wishing to breed, but when
they do start they are often prolific. Among the many

Australia, but they were wastrels, and although in Singapore
one sees cages full of Gouldians at times, often said to be
cage-bred, the evidence that they are so bred and not wild-
caught birds from Australia is lacking.
In Australian aviaries in different places I saw many
breeding pairs, often bringing off nests of five or more young,
but even there breeders tell me all is not always plain sailing
and stocks may die off after a year or two apparent perfect
success. The general opinion there seems to be they breed
better in indoor than in outdoor aviaries. If that is so in
Australia's climate, how much more should it apply in ours !

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
A MACAW BRED IN GERMANY
In Die gefiederte Welt for March, 1932 (p. 110) is a most interesting
account by Herr Muller of the breeding of the Blue and Buff Macaw
(Ara ararauna) in the large aviary at the Essen Tierpark which they
shared with other large Parrots and where all could have free use of
their wings. The following is a rough translation of the essential
facts.
In June of last year three eggs were laid at two-day intervals by
the hen of one of the two pairs of Araraunas in the aviary, and on these
both parents sat assiduously, but unfortunately without result, and
the eggs were removed after six weeks and found to be unfertile. On
5th September another egg was laid, to be followed at two-day intervals
by a second and third, the father and mother again taking turns at
incubation, and always showing the greatest excitement at any
approach, screaming and flapping their wings at every step not only
in the aviary, but even anywhere near outside. After four weeks one

of the eggs hatched (5th October) and a young one emerged, naked
except for very scanty down and noteworthy for its huge beak, a really
astonishing outsized thing in beaks. The anxious care of its parents
continued and both were constantly engaged in feeding it as it grew,
taking the ordinary Parrot food supplied, boiled egg, bananas, bread
soaked in milk, etc., softening it in their crops and thence feeding the
youngster, which grew rapidly. The trio were removed to their winter
quarters at the end of October and the young bird was still thriving
and over four months old at the time the account was written. This
closes with the hope of further success in the following season, but
I do not think that any further details have yet appeared.
An editorial note appended gives previous Macaw breeding records :
(1) The historic case at Caen in 1818 when in the course of four years
nineteen clutches were laid and fifteen young reared ; (2) a later
success in a room, where the notable fact was that the young bird was
ninety-four days old before it left the nest ; (3) a third success with
Sharland, but no details ; and (4) the hybrid ararauna X chloroptera
bred at the Dresden Zoo in 1897.
I should have mentioned that the article is illustrated with three
good photographs of the young bird at various ages from seven to
twelve weeks.

THE BREEDING OF THE PURPLE-HEADED STARLING
It was at the beginning of June that I became aware that one pair
of these Starlings had a nest in a hollow apple log in my aviary, but
how long this had been going on I don't quite know as both birds were
very artful in not letting me see them go in or come out of the nest.
They always went out before I could open the door. This went on
till the end of June, when one morning I found that instead of eating
mealworms, etc., both birds had a beakful and sat on the perch like
statues with them till I had gone, so I was sure they had hatched.
This went on for about a fortnight, when the young Starlings drew
to the hole in the log and I saw three.
One young one came out about a week before the other two. It

was about half tbe proper size, well feathered, but I saw it was not
a sound bird, it died in four days' time. The others remained in the
nest another three days, and one morning I found them out, large
strong birds. The last two or three days they were in the nest I never
heard a sound from them. I have been told by a leading aviculturist
these Starlings often give up feeding their young ones and that it
is better to take away the cock after the young are hatched with some
varieties, but I did not do this as I found that the male bird was feeding
the young a good deal more than the hen. I gave them all the meal-
worms they could eat and left some always in a rather deep tin. Of
course, they had other food of all sorts besides. I am sorry I cannot
give definite dates as it was very hard to know what these birds were
doing. During the winter I had them with another pair of Starlings
of the same sort, but they killed the other cock, and the other hen
would have shared the same fate had I not taken her away. The
Editor tells me that Purple-headed Starlings were bred in the Zoo in
1871 and 1874, but I think this was before the days when the Avicultural
Society's Medal was awarded. I possess one Medal which was awarded
to my father for breeding the Bed-vented Blue-bonnet Parrakeet,
and should much like to win another !
I shall be pleased to answer any questions I can as to rearing
these Starlings.
Windsor D. Parker.
[In his Records of Birds Bred in Captivity , Dr. Hopkinson writes of
Lamprocolius purpureus : " Buss says they were bred at the London
Zoo, and Wiener, that young were hatched there in 1871 and 1874,
but Butler says that he can find no record of this in the Zoo Proceedings.
Neunzig also makes no mention of breeding : this must therefore be
a very doubtful record."
In the Zoological Society's List of Animals published in 1883 there
is a record of a young bird of this species hatched in the Gardens on
5th August, 1871, and a second hatched 17th August, 1874. A search
through the volumes of the Daily Occurrences reveals the fact that the
one hatched in 1871 died at nine days old, but the other, hatched in
1874, lived for nearly eleven years.-- Ed.]

SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT OF SICK CASSOWARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999806941176471" page_id="56222079"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
We have had a Cassowary some three years now. This bird has
always been fairly wild. One could go in the pen with him but he was
easily startled and could never be handled. Early in June, 1932,
he apparently contracted a chill. He failed to get up one morning,
and when forced up was quite weak at the ec knees ", he was gasping
visibly through a widely open beak, and after staggering round a bit
just sat down and closed his eyes. He made not the slightest resistance
to being handled. On my arrival to " vet " him I was at once struck
with the burning heat of his neck and head. I have not yet learned
how to take a Cassowary's temperature. Anyway, I made a provisional
diagnosis of pneumonia. The bird was obviously very ill, and indeed
seemed dying. At times he would peck feebly at bits of banana and
apple. On inspecting his mouth I found that the orifice of the trachsea,
which is peculiarly obvious in these birds, was markedly inflamed,
and some thin mucus discharge was constantly present in the lower
mandible. This exactly resembled human " saliva This bird,
following the winter, was in average condition. I will simply describe
the treatment adopted, on empirical lines. The bird did not cough.
One symptom I did not like was a weakening or softening of the
lower mandible making it overlap the upper. I have seen the same
thing in sick and debilitated Parrots. I blame this softening to a
Vitamin D shortage, and a similar condition is observable in young
crocodiles. (Birds are not so far from the reptiles.) At this time I
was treating with success a 12-inch crocodile whose bones were so soft
that he fairly flattened under his own weight and further could hardly
breathe owing to the softening of his ribs. The treatment for the
crocodile was a massive dose daily of Adexolin (one teaspoonful, in
fact) and forcible feeding.
We started off by giving our Cassowary a teaspoonful of brandy
frequently, a teaspoonful of Adexolin night and morning, an orange in
quarters at the same time. We forcibly fed him dog biscuits, apple,
banana, and lettuce. After the first few days he began eating a bit
himself, and was extra avid for a mixture of flint limestone and oyster-
shell, together with lettuce. At the end of the week he was on his

feet again, eating very well but still gasping and sitting down
suddenly.
Now, in the fourth week, he is apparently normal again, and I
doubt if we could hold him to administer any drug.
I am told that this bird, being up to date so healthy, had been
ignored to some extent, when the daily fresh vegetable ration was
being handed out last winter. Whether a Cassowary manufactures
Vitamin D in his skin and feathers or not I do not know. Anyway,
there has not been enough sunlight last winter for him to do so.
I am satisfied that the condition was a vitamin shortage, which
made this bird susceptible to infection and he got pneumonia.
Whether our treatment had any effect or not I do not know, but,
anyway, the bird is recovering. I should strongly advise the use of
Adexolin in any sick bird.
Of course, I must not forget to say that the second week I added two
heaped teaspoonfuls of Bemax to his diet; this is vitamin B which is
so strongly recommended by Mr. Hastings in a recent issue.

With reference to the article on above subject by Mr. G. H. Clarke
in last month's issue, those who are interested in the origin of this
bird may be interested to read, if they have not already done so, the
chapter in A Bird Painter's Sketchbook , by Philip Rirkman (Eyre and
Spottiswood, 1931 on " The Pheasant " (p. 133). In this chapter,
which is largely on this subject of Mutants, he states : "So far as we
know Mutants have not been found in a completely wild state. By
that I mean where no human agency could be traced." It appears
to me a chapter on the subject worth reading. I have several of
these birds here and I do not think they stray very badly as they are
accused of doing by many sportsmen.

I wonder if any of our members can explain the following
phenomenon.
Last evening a Tanager died unexpectedly which I have only had
a couple of months. Although never a really good bird as regards
plumage, it appeared healthy, fed well, and even yesterday afternoon,
when I last saw it alive, looked comparatively well. On finding it
dead in the evening my man carefully examined it; he could see no
reason for its sudden death. It was also perfectly clean in every
respect. He put it away in a box and on looking at it an hour later
he found the body swarming with minute black lice, thousands of
them appeared to be running over it. I am at a loss to know whence
these lice could have come in such a short space of time ; is it possible
that the eggs could have been in the bird's feathers and hatched
immediately after death ? I have had birds troubled with lice before
death, which in fact probably hastened the death, but do not remember
a case like this before and should be very interested if anyone could
suggest a likely cause or explanation.
G. H. Gurney.
[There is no doubt that lice multiply excessively when their host
becomes ill though they are not apparent to human eyes unless the
bird is handled and closely examined. When death takes place and
the body commences to cool they emerge and become visible.-- Ed.]

I have read the article in the August number on the breeding of

that these are super-delightful little birds, and easily acclimatized in
this country. But I must say with all sincerity that I have never
carried out the different treatments he alludes to in the way of cleaning
the nesting material with paraffin oil, and feeding the young with
only spray millet. The latter statement is not correct in my own
aviary, as I have found the moment the young ones are able to leave

to forage for themselves. Of course, 1 am not aware of the space of
Mr. Jones 5 confinements for the birds, but I have a very large flying
space with a big and small shelter with a birch wall round, which these
Finches seem to fancy very much for their nests. They require from
me no encouragement to pair or breed. I had two cock birds left over
from last year, and I was able to get from De Yon two hens, and these
two pairs have multiplied rather like the common House-sparrow.
It would take me all my time to ring them all as suggested by your
correspondent, besides frightening and disturbing all the other birds.
I must say that I have never found any of my birds having a set-to in
the pairing season or not or over their food. I think this may be because
I have a birch wall separating the two aviaries, although there is a small
flight-hole where they manage to fly through when they so require.
I have innumerable small bushes and virgin bush all over the place,
in fact the aviary is a very wild spot indeed but not over-smothered
in weeds, as the mice, which are a curse, hide in them, and since I always
keep them down. Through all the heavy rain that occurred in July
my Zebra Finches did not seem to care a jot for the weather and they
are always out in the heaviest downfall. The last nest they constructed
was in a very inconvenient place, namely, a seed-hopper.

THE MUTANT PHEASANT

Phasianus mut. tenebrosus (Hachisuka)
By The Hon. M. Hachisuka
We are now all familiar with the so-called mutant Pheasant which
is increasing so rapidly in our woods. It is no longer a class of fancy
Pheasant but is becoming a very popular figure among the game birds
of this country.
There are still a considerable amount of biological questions not yet
answered relating to this bird, and there have been certain disputable
questions raised by ornithologists at the British Ornithologists'
Club as well as in the leading ornithological journal, The Ibis, since
this Pheasant was first described by myself in 1926 as a mutational
species which had suddenly cropped up amongst the common Pheasants;
also Dr. P. R. Lowe has long been studying a series of male skins
he has collected himself since 1921. It would, therefore, not be
out of place at this juncture to give the history of this Pheasant.
We are all familiar with the sudden appearance of the distinct
species of Peafowl, Black-winged--and the Golden Pheasant, Black-
throated--which was produced in Holland towards the end of the
last century. Both species, nigri&apos;pennis and obscurus, breed true to
type and exist in European gardens as distinct species. The production

M. Hachisuka--The Mutant Pheasant
of these Peafowl and G-olden Pheasant are quite outside the human
control. This phenomena--what I term mutation--and its nature
is quite different from the various colour phases of Guinea Fowls
and Budgerigars, which are mere albinism or melanism of birds
sporadically occurring among wild and cage birds and disappears
quickly after a few generations unless artificial control is enforced.
My Pheasant is a parallel example of the Peafowl and Golden
Pheasant just referred to, and we are all aware of the co-existence of
two species of Pheasant, colchicus and tenehrosus, in our woods. It is
like the Tree and House Sparrow, or many allied species of Warblers
breeding in this country in more or less the same type of surroundings.
It was one day during the winter when I happened to be looking
round the poultry shops in Cambridge that I came across a Grouse-
like looking Pheasant. After taking it home and carefully dissecting
it, it proved to be an adult female, but I could not identify to what
species it belonged. I then showed the specimen to Lord Kothschild
who, much to my surprise, told me he was familiar with this type of
bird as coming from Norfolk as early as about 1880. He then brought
to London a male specimen of this bird and after careful study I
subsequently described it at the British Ornithologists' Club as a
mutant tenehrosus. It was afterwards figured in UOiseau in France
and in Tori in Japan.
This was the first time a mutant species was described as it should
be and all other descriptions of mutants are misleadingly and
merely described as sub-species, species, or hybrids. In order to prove
that tenehrosus is of mutational origin I decided to undertake breeding
experiments and an ornithological friend as well as the Zoological
Society kindly offered me a good stock which I took back with me to
Japan to be bred for several generations. While these experiments
were being carried out tenehrosus suddenly became common in England
and was brought to the notice of several people. At the same time
tenehrosus --being dark in coloration--made considerable confusion,
as it was thought to be the hybrid between colchicus and versicolor.
Most of us are not familiar with the authentic hybrid of the above two
species but vaguely remember that the cross in question is a darker
bird than the common English Pheasant.

The Marquess of Tavistock--The Breeding of Lutino Bingnecks 235
It is true that versicolor has been introduced and hybridized in
this country but the pure strain has now quite died out, at least from
the point of view of the colour of the feathers.
The coloured plate here reproduced is drawn by Mr. H. Gronvold
from a perfectly pure specimen of tenehrosus since set up and soon to
be exhibited in the Bird Gallery of the British Museum at South
Kensington. The above-mentioned plate was the first to appear
in any ornithological journal in this country.
It is interesting to learn that the mutant Pheasant made its
appearance in France within the last two or three years and Professor
Lonnberg, of Stockholm, informs me that this Pheasant has also
appeared in Sweden, but this is probably derived from the English
stock which has regularly been imported to that country. It is also
worthy of record that tenebrosus is also obtained in Japan from the
pure versicolor group in its wild state.
It will be interesting in future to notice to what extent the mutant
Pheasant will multiply in the feral state ; whether it will stand by
itself in range with colchicus or entirely replace that species.
[Since writing the above article I have read Mr. D. Seth-Smith's
article on the same subject which appeared in The Ibis for July. I
entirely share the opinions he there expresses.--M. H.]
THE BREEDING OF LUTINO RINGNECKS
By The Marquess of Tavistock
This article might also be called Per ardua ad astra since it must
be about eighteen years ago that Mr. Ezra gave me a lovely golden
parrakeet with red eyes and white flight feathers and I embarked on
the thorny path of endeavour in trying to get her to reproduce her
virtues in her descendants. This original bird (she is still alive but
has .not bred for many years and is obviously aged) though a
wonderful colour, was not otherwise a good specimen, having a rather
humped-up look and flying heavily, and these defects she unfortunately
transmitted to her offspring with unnecessary fidelity.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996588888888889" page_id="56222094"  page_num="236" year="" vol="">
I knew little about parrakeet breeding in those days and kept her
and her green mate in an indoor bird-room with the not unnatural
result of clear eggs for two successive seasons. I then tried her in a
small fixed outdoor aviary and my stock was added to by a further
generous gift by Mr. Ezra of a really fine hen, perfect not only in colour
but in every other respect.
From these birds during the next few years I succeeded in raising
about seven or eight green young ones, but only one, a hen, was a
really good specimen, the others being undersized or defective in their
wings and flying badly. The only surviving child of the best hen
was a small cock, not too good in his wings, and with a permanently
moth-eaten look round his neck. As long as they remained in their
original quarters I could not, moreover, get a fertile egg from any of
the males I bred.
Then came the transfer of the stock to the 24 ft. movable aviaries
I still use. A decided improvement followed. The first year, from the
two lutino hens mated to green wild cocks, I reared four much better
young ones. One of these unfortunately died while under the temporary
care of a friend : the other three, two nice cocks and a moderate hen,
I still have.
The lutino-bred greens being, with one exception, still in immature
plumage and difficult to sex, I turned all together into the same aviary.
Two hens nested and one hatched her egg but the young one I found
dead a day or two later with its beak and toes bitten off. I attributed
the misdeed to a vicious spinster hen and to colony breeding, but I
learned later who was the real culprit!
Next year I paired the best lutino hen to a fair-sized but badly-
shaped lutino-bred cock and the old hen to the rough-necked cock.
Both duly went to nest and this time both lots of eggs were fertile
and my hopes of lutinos began to run high. One morning, half-way
through the incubation period, I noticed the mate of the best hen
looking ill and caged him in the hospital. A few hours later the lutino
was off and also looking ill so I had to cage her and give the eggs to
an unmated Alexandrine Parrakeet who was incubating an infertile
clutch. By evening the lutino-bred cock was dead ; by next morning
his mate was dead. So sudden had been their illness that I felt sure

The Marquess of Tavistock--The Breeding of Lutino Ringnecks 237
they had picked up rat poison but a post-mortem examination revealed
a virulent form of pneumonia. In due course the Alexandrine hatched
the orphan eggs and immediately killed the young ones. She had
incubated infertile clutches so long that I believe she regarded it as
a shocking and unnatural event that eggs should produce tiny pink
monstrosities and did her best to hush up the unpleasant affair !
About the same time the old lutino was due to hatch and I looked
into the nest. Another tragedy ! Tiny mangled corpses minus beaks
and feet. I knew that the hen was a good mother and would not be
guilty of this outrage so the blame must fall on her disreputable husband
with the ragged neck. He doubtless had murdered his former offspring
by the lutino-bred hen the previous season. The next year I put the
ragged cock with the only really good lutino-bred hen I had reared in
the fixed aviaries, intending to remove him before the eggs hatched
and run him with the lutino hen, also for a limited period. The lutino-
bred duly vanished into her nest-box. (To give the cock his due he
is an attentive husband to any lady of his race whatever his sins may
be as a parent.) After a time when I judged it wise to change the cock
I looked into the nest. No eggs, no hen. I hunted everywhere for a
corpse and found nothing. She had vanished into thin air and to this
day I do not know what became of her.
I tried the rough-necked cock with the lutino hen for several more
years but had no luck. Sometimes the young were dead in the shell.
Sometimes they died soon after hatching, in some cases through my
fault for I put the nest in the shelter instead of in the open flight.
Finally, the old lady started having trouble with egg-binding. Then she
missed a season with a catarrhal discharge from one nostril, and after
that she stopped laying, though every spring she retired into her nest
and for weeks and weeks spent a soothing time of retreat incubating
the memories of the past--a habit I find very common with ancient
dames of her genus !
I was now left with two cocks and a hen lutino-bred green reared
in movable aviaries and two hens bred in fixed aviaries, one a big
bird but a poor flier, the other small and also a poor flier. The small
hen I sometimes tried with the rough-necked cock but she was
terribly clumsy with her eggs and year after year contrived to crack

or dent any that were fertile, losing the only young she happened
to hatch.
The big hen laid two eggs in a nest in the shelter. Both hatched,
and to my delight one was a lutino. Alas ! the situation was all against
the health of the young. Both left the nest hopelessly rickety and died
a few days later.
Next year I gave her a grandfather-clock nest outside, and she
damaged both her eggs. The other pair.with a similar nest lost their
young one as soon as it hatched. All three hens appeared to be firm
believers in birth-control, never laying more than two eggs in a year
and often only one.
Next came the moving of the birds to Peasmarsh. The hen bred
in a movable aviary was upset by the change and did not nest at all.
The big hen again hatched two young ones, a lutino and a green. Both
were nice birds but within a few days of leaving the nest the lutino
died of sunstroke ! The same season the small hen mated to the rough-
necked cock managed single-handed to rear a nice green young one,
a far better specimen than either of its parents. It and the nest-mate
of the dead lutino are still alive and are both males. They are strong
and robust birds.
Last year the mother of the lutino had two green young ones.
One died in the nest when half-grown. The other, a cock, was reared
but was a poor specimen and I gave it away when a year old.
The movable aviary pair reared a lutino and a green to leave the
nest, the former a very nice one. The green hurt itself and died a
few days after flying and soon afterwards the lutino was found
paralysed in both legs. With careful nursing it seemed likely
to recover but it finished by regaining complete use of one foot only
and I had to give it away as a pet. The small hen again damaged
her eggs.
1932 came round with hopes not inconsiderably chastened by
former experiences. All three hens took to their nests. When the
incubation period was up I looked in the nest of the one that bred the
first lutino. Nothing, not even eggs ! She must be nearly sixteen years
old and had her toes badly frost-bitten some winters ago so probably,
never having been a good bird, her breeding days are done.

The Marquess of Tavistock--The Breeding of Lutino Bingnecks 239
The small hen had one addled egg and one with a dead chick with
the usual dent in the shell.
The third pair had two young but both were green. These were
reared and are fair specimens. Once more, it seemed, I must wait for
the coming of another season with my stock reduced by a hen no longer
breeding ; but the unexpected happened. For the first time in her life
the small hen laid again ! Her mate was duly removed when hatching
drew near and, amazing to relate, she hatched both her eggs. Still
more amazing both young birds proved to be lutinos and fine specimens
at that. They are now out of the nest and flying strongly. Though I
could wish she were more skilful in the handling of her eggs, I have
nothing but praise for the devotion of the scrubby little green mother.
So poor a flier that she gets about entirely by climbing, late in the
season and single-handed, she has done her offspring so well that they
look as though they had been reared by wild Bingnecks of the best
quality. But it will not do to rely on appearances too far ; if they
live to reach breeding age I shall mate them to strong wild greens
and thus try and eliminate any faults, constitutional or moral, that
may have come down to them from their dubious ancestry !
The results of this somewhat protracted experiment indicate that
every pair of lutino-bred greens will produce a percentage of lutinos
if mated inter se. Probably this rule holds good with the breeding
of all rare colour varieties of Parrakeets. For some reason or other it
is usually, in practice, wise to get all the young you can from your
rare-coloured bird mated to normal wild ones and pair the progeny
inter se and not to break your original pair in order to mate son to
mother or father to daughter ; the result of the latter venture is apt
to be infertile eggs and wasted seasons.
Of the young Bingnecks from lutino-bred parents that have lived
long enough for their colour to be discernible, eight have been green
and five lutino, which is, I think, very near the Mendelian percentage.

THE REARING OF WHITE-BRED ROSEATE
COCKATOOS
By The Marquess of Tavistock
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999716516129032" page_id="56222098"  page_num="240" year="" vol="">
Some years ago the late Mr. Heumann sent me what he hoped would
prove a white Roseate Cockatoo. The bird's wings were a rather
chalky white, but as her plumage was a good deal stained by travel
it was difficult to tell what colour she really was. During the moult
she assumed a garb of rather pale grey, which was a disappointment,
but she was a good breeding hen and, paired to a normal male, reared
more than one family without fuss or bother. A few years later
Mr. Heumann sent me a pair and this time there was no mistaking the
genuine article, their snowy wings and backs forming a lovely contrast
to their rosy breasts. Alas ! tragedy was in store. The use of damp
sand to cover the cage floor produced a serious chill. In spite of every-
thing we could do the hen died and only with difficulty did we save the
cock. When spring came round I sent the survivor, together with the
pale grey female, to my friends at Keston, but though the birds kept
in good health, the change to a small aviary demoralized them and they
made no serious attempt at nesting.
Neither did matters improve when I brought them to Peasmarsh.
The first year they did nothing : last year things looked much more
promising but at the last moment the hen dropped her egg from the
perch in the aviary shelter. She then collected a few slivers of wood
and arranged them round the broken egg as a sort of funeral wreath
and proceeded to moult. This year I provided her with a tempting
assortment of tree-trunks and grandfather-clock nests with bark-covered
tops. One of the latter appeared to attract her. You can always tell
if Cockatoos are favourably impressed with the type of nest you offer
them. If they like it they go into it but bite it very little ; after all,
if we liked our new house we should never think of gnawing a hole
through the front door and another through the nursery floor !
As a precaution I told the aviary attendant to put some soft material
on the floor of the shelter in case the hen should forget herself again.
Sure enough she did : one morning an egg lay on the floor and what

was worse, since enough peat moss had not been used, it was a broken
egg. You Budgerigar and Finch breeders with birds willing to
lay half a dozen eggs three times a year, you may thank your stars
that the fate of a season does not depend on a single egg or, at
most, two !
After this debacle the Roseates took no more interest in their nest
and a sinister dropped flight feather or two proclaimed, " No more
hope till 1933." I was disgusted with the hen. Year after year I
had kept her on because of her pale colour and early performances,
but now she had failed me five seasons in succession. She should go
and her place be taken by an ordinary lady of darker hue who had a
proper appreciation of the comforts of a good home. The ordinary
lady duly arrived and as it was too late to hope for anything this year
was temporarily installed two aviaries away. That did the trick. Just
as the best method of inducing an unprolific pen of fowls to commence
business in the egg line is to start to eat them, so the best way to make
a disappointing matron of the Parrot family do her duty is to prepare
to get rid of her. The hen Roseate discerned what the coming of

that other lady portended. She stopped moulting, once more took a
lively interest in her nest, and her complexion deepened hopefully.
" In the spring a fuller crimson comes upon the Cockatoo.

(This is not the poet's fancy but is absolutely true.")
While the breast of the Robin and the neck of the Dove remain
wholly unchanged since the moult of the previous autumn, the breast
of a Roseate coming into breeding condition deepens by quite two shades
without any moult at all.
In due course two eggs arrived, not on the floor of the shelter but
in the proper place. The white cock proved a faithful and devoted
father, spending more time in brooding than is usual with his species.
The only thing that seriously upset him was the appearance of my
daughter's new dachshund who was immediately identified with Yellow
Dog Dingo and treated to an ear-splitting demonstration by the out-
raged parents, until hastily removed.
In due course the babies hatched and have now made their exit into
the world--a nice couple, but normal in colour and darker than either
parent, as is usual in the first generation. If they are ever to produce

By Mrs. Darnton
I bought my cock Scarlet Tanager from a dealer in July, 1931. When
he arrived I put him into a cage by himself, and although he had been
in England several months he was as wild as the proverbial Hawk.
Only after he had been with me several weeks did he condescend to
furtively snatch a mealworm from my fingers. The dealer had told me
that his wings were clipped and that he wasn't sure if he would be able
to fly to the branches in the aviary so, to make certain that he could,
I released him one day in the room. He immediately flew straight
into a large glass case containing a stuffed flying fox, half stunning
himself, and when he recovered, but before I could catch him, he had
crashed into several others which was bad for him, but which assured
me that his flying powers were not impaired ! He looked so lovely
in the aviary that I made up my mind that the following year I would
try to breed them, so about a month later on my way through London
to Norfolk I went to De Yon's and bought a freshly imported hen--
his future wife. I took her with me in the car and when I got to my
destination had a cage brought to my room in which I put her. Her
plumage was very rough, but she was in good condition and improving
daily when, one morning, on putting in a fresh orange, she slipped
under my hand and crashed at full speed into a mirror over the mantel-
piece. She fell back on the hearthrug with her head back and I thought
she had broken her neck. With a sinking feeling I picked her up, but
in a minute or two she began to come round. I put her back in her cage
and there she sat for the rest of the day, hardly moving.
I was very worried, especially as for three days afterwards she
hardly ate at all, but very gradually she recovered, although for weeks

she seemed dazed. I christened her " Nellie Knowles 55 after a nurse
we had as children, whom we considered a little ee dippy " ! When we
got home I turned her out with the cock--" Rouge et Noir "--where
she lived happily till early October when I brought them both into
the house.
There they lived in a large cage, about 5 ft. high by 5 ft. wide by
3 ft. deep, with a Superb Tanager, two cock Fischer's, a Pintail, and a
Paradise Whydah, and later I bought a pair of Blue Robins, a cock
Shama, and a pair of Pekins. They all lived most amiably together,
except Rouge et Noir and Nellie--she turned out a most exacting
spouse and was continually rowing him. If he went down for a bite of
banana she thought she would like some too and would sit and swear
at him with her " hair " on end, and snapping at him until she had
driven him off. Even if he were sitting snoozing on a branch which
she suddenly fancied he had nothing but unpleasantness until he had
given it up. All the softbills got very tame during the winter, most
of them perching on my arm when I whistled for them. They all had
the run of the room, our sitting-room by the way, when I cleaned them
out, which, as I had numerous other cages to do, generally took an
hour and a half every morning. They all flew out of their cage in more
or less of a stream when I whistled and always went back at the end
of their playtime. Even newcomers got into the routine after about
a week, and it was only on the very rarest occasions that I had to take
the net to any of them. A couple of hen canaries were the only stubborn
ones--these I had to net nearly every morning until I got so sick of
catching them that I put them into a separate cage.
When May came I put the Scarlet Tanagers in the shelter of the
new aviary. This has a flight about 40 ft. by 20 ft. planted with
a large privet bush, a couple of dogwoods, and a row of Cypress
Macrocarpa and Retinosperas down the north side to act as a wind
break. The aviaries, by the way, are in the centre of the rose garden,
which is surrounded by a high screen of climbing roses and backed on
the north by an apple orchard.
Already in February I had noticed Nellie Knowles, the hen Tanager,
showing signs of that spring-like feeling. When loose in the room
she was continually making up to Rouge et Noir and even picking the

stuffing out of one of the armchairs which was showing the passage of
time. She certainly was less exacting in her behaviour to him and I
was pretty sure they would have a shot at nesting, but the weather
was so cold that I didn't open the shutter of their shelter and let
them into the flight till 19th May.
It was a lovely spring day, a warm sun with hardly a breath stirring,
and they were delighted to be in the open once more.
With them were a pair of Shamas but otherwise they had the place
to themselves. They had both moulted out during the early part of
the winter and both were in superb condition and plumage. They
looked marvellous, either flying down for a mealworm on to the daisy-
spangled grass or fluttering from branch to branch in the dogwoods.
As the days went by I noticed that she had quite stopped scolding
him and my hopes ran high. Then one morning, 29th May, upon going
into the aviary, I noticed Nellie with a piece of hay in her beak. She
hopped down and collected more, finally flying with it all into the
privet bush. This went on more or less all day, but Rouge et Noir
never attempted to help and merely sat about watching, or occasionally
flew at her very excitedly and rushed about the flight as if to relieve
his feelings.
This continued for some days, until one day I was lucky enough to
see him displaying to her. He made his body very slim and, erecting
a ruff of feathers round his head, he would sidle up to her, swaying
meanwhile from side to side. It was rather a wonderful sight and
I was overjoyed to see it as I hoped it meant business.
Meanwhile the nest was nearly finished, built of grass, hay, rootlets,
and a few dry bamboo leaves. It was placed nearly at the top of the
privet, but Nellie always went to it from under the bush, climbing
up the branches until she had reached it and then coming out at the
top. I made a shelter of " Windolite " on a wooden framework in
preparation for those sudden deluges which are apt to wash nests
away, and hung it over the bush. Then to my disgust I had to go to
London for several days. I returned on 8th June having been away
five days. Naturally the first thing I did was to rush down to the
aviary. Nellie was nowhere to be seen, but the cock was sitting on
a branch looking very self-satisfied. After looking for her everywhere

I finally crept up to the bush--there she was, sitting on her nest.
What a thrill!
Next morning she was still there and I wondered whether she was
egg-bound, although she looked quite normal, but in the evening she
came off to feed and, shutting them both in the shelter, I went and
looked in the nest. Three eggs !
They were rather a light blue, like a small Thrush's, and three is
the full clutch I believe. She had fined the nest with fine hay and a
little horsehair, a moderately deep affair and very neatly made. She
sat beautifully, only leaving the nest about three times a day for a
quick feed, the cock not assisting at all. I continually wondered
whether the eggs were fertile as he seemed so very uninterested in
nursery affairs, but on the morning of the 20th June, that is, twelve
days after finding her sitting on my return from London, she was off the
nest and, taking a quick peep, I saw two little black bodies and only
one egg. I felt like that much-heard-of animal, the dog with two tails,
and on finding the third egg hatched after lunch, my joy was unbounded.
But now comes the snag. For some little time we had gone in for
that delectable side-line, maggot breeding, but through an oversight
on the part of the gardener, who had forgotten to order a fresh sheeps-
head, we were suddenly maggotless ! I had managed to find about fifteen
or twenty small ones, but I didn't dare to put them in a dish on the ground
as I knew the Shamas would finish them off before one could turn round.
The only thing to do was to hand them to her as she came off the nest.
This I did, sitting in the aviary all day, as she came off about every ten
minutes. I also found about eight or nine spiders, but I felt that
things were somewhat desperate. I telephoned to several places in
London---no maggots anywhere.
I had also no idea as to whether she was going to be a good mother
so, after considerable thought, I decided to put two of the babies in
a Tit's box in the orchard, which had already two baby Blue Robins
in it only a few days old. Then as a last resource I sent my husband
over to Maidstone, 15 miles away, to continue the maggot hunt !
He came back triumphant, having found a fishing tackle shop where
they were sold as bait. Only very few of them were clean enough to
give the birds, but we picked out some which we placed in a dish,

together with some fresh ants 5 eggs, under the Tanager's bush for the
early morning feed.
The babies were almost black, and naked except for a little dark
fluff on the head, and with dark carmine gapes.
Next day I managed to get her to take a few black clocks and the
gardener found a small wasps' nest, the grubs from which were much
appreciated.
On the morning of the 23rd on looking into the Tit's box, which by
the way I had done daily, I found to my horror one baby Tanager
missing. For a moment I stared bewildered, I could not imagine what
had happened. They had seemed all right when I had looked at
them the day before, both squeaking lustily and opening their little
mouths wide for food. Then a thought struck me--had it been starved
and thrown out--dead ? A young Tit has a yellow gape, so has a
baby Blue Robin. Had by chance the mother Tit not seen the dark
gape of the Tanagers so easily, consequently not giving them sufficient
food ?
I took out the remaining baby--the parent Blue Tits cursing my
interference from a nearby branch--and removed it to the aviary.
I managed to coax Nellie and Rouge et Noir into the shelter, and then
I placed the baby back in its original nest. Poor mite, when it was side
by side with the other, I saw that it was definitely much smaller.
I released the pair of Tanagers from the shelter, giving Nellie the last
wasp grub. She immediately took it to the nest and presumably fed
the hungry youngster as I heard it squeaking. Then she came back
time after time for more--clocks, maggots, and ants' eggs all being
taken at speed to the baby until it was satisfied.
They both grew steadily and after a few days it was difficult to say
which was which.
By the 27th they had the wing quills well formed and the head
quills just appearing. By this time Rouge et Noir had become a most
attentive father and Nellie a truly wonderful mother, always on the
nest when not feeding. The weather, which had been very cold for a
couple of days after they had hatched, now turned really hot and it
was most pleasant sitting in a deck chair in the aviary watching the
birds and handing out clocks, now the most popular feed, as required.

By 20th June, at ten days old, the babies were feathering nicely,
the brown appearing on their breasts. During the morning of 2nd July
I noticed that Nellie seemed to be trying to get her babies to leave the
nest, and having heard from Mr. Seth-Smith that the great fault with
Tanagers was that they left the nest too soon and died from exposure,
I decided to put them in the shelter and shut them up with their mother.
I walked to the bush and parted the leaves : one baby immediately
fluttered out and the other flopped into the bush. The excitement
meanwhile and the noise from the parents was colossal. The cock flew
at my head and Nellie flew at the cock !
I picked up the two offspring and put them on some hay on the
floor of the shelter. Poor old Nell was calling excitedly from the bush
not realizing where they had gone, so I held out one of the babies to
her, which she promptly tried to feed in my hand, and backed away
until she followed me into the shelter.
While sitting resting after this effort, I heard several clear notes
repeated over and over again. I looked round and saw that it was
Kouge et Noir singing ! The first time I had ever heard him--overjoyed
at the success of his family affairs I suppose. The babies grew well
until they were exactly like their mother, except that they had not
the red over the tail.
Now comes the really tragic part. I had to go away for a fortnight.
We had had a month of really gorgeous weather, but just after I left,
it turned very cold and wet. The far door of the shelter was left open,
and the wind must have swept right through.
I only got back in time to see them die.
The post-mortem revealed acute catarrhal enteritis. They were
about six weeks old when they died, and both cocks.
Moral--Don't leave home when you have precious young birds
about. Something is sure to happen. I was terribly upset, but perhaps
I shall have another chance as Nellie has gone to nest again in the
same privet, and is now sitting--this time on two eggs.

193-2; THE THINGS THAT DIDN'T COME
OFF AND THE NEW ARRIVALS
By The Marquess of Tavistock

The present season, now almost at an end as far as further breeding
prospects are concerned, has been on the whole a decidedly good one
and in some ways unique. In the first place this summer has been
the healthiest I can remember in twenty years of aviculture, just as last
summer was one of the most disease-ridden. Since the middle of May
I have only lost three acclimatized birds in the aviaries and had two
ill, both of which recovered. In the birdroom I have lost two this
year's youngsters only, one being a weakling. No doubt the autumn
will make amends but for June and July to have a death- and sickness-
rate as low as December and January is simply phenomenal, and
I fear I shall never know it again !
It has been a good year likewise for stamina in young stock. Out of
some fifty young birds hatched, only four have died in the nest and only
three have been weakly, two having rickets. No cod-liver oil soaked
seed was given this year but last year, in spite of cod-liver oil, there were
about fifteen cases of rickets, the parents being, with two exceptions,
the same as this year and having practically the same treatment
with, perhaps, a trifle more green food and seed thrown on the
ground to sprout.
It has also been a good year for eggs. Out of thirty-three possible
breeding pairs only five failed to get as far as this important stage and
two of these may make amends yet.
The five non-starters are the King Birds of Paradise, the Purple
Sunbirds, the Palm Cockatoos, the Blue-fronted Amazons, and the
Musky Lorikeets. To these might be added the Imperial Amazons,
but as one is badly damaged by shot and I am not quite certain that
they are a true pair they can hardly be called a fair chance ; even they,
however, got as far as going inside a nest.
The Birds of Paradise were successfully wintered in an outdoor
aviary. Their shelter was well heated but the going-out of the heater
on the coldest night of all did not affect them. Probably they are

1932; the Things that didn&apos;t come off and the New Arrivals 249
hardier than we imagine. The hen carried nesting material a little
in early spring and the cock became more vocal with cat-calls, but
as is usual with this species they fell into moult in May and are now
(15th August) only just through.
The Purple Sunbirds were my biggest disappointment. I had a
beautiful hen given me late last summer and she came through the
winter in show condition.
In May I introduced her to the cock's aviary where she settled down
at once and seemed very happy, while he was as civil and attentive
as a cock Sunbird can reasonably be expected to be. For a time she
carried nesting material and things looked promising, but nothing
more happened and the cock is now in winter plumage once more.
They still agree all right but experience has taught me that he will
become a dangerous bully in mid-winter when he begins to re-assume
breeding plumage.
The Palm Cockatoos are very well and lively and the cock some-
times goes into a nest-box and destroys part of it, but they are
exceedingly timid and I think their wildness is the chief handicap.
Before they regained their spirits I thought them rather silent birds
but now they have a remarkable repertoire both as regards variety
and volume of sound. At first the only noises they made were a harsh
grating scream of terror and a shriek like an excited housemaid. Now
the housemaid yell is sometimes prefaced by a high-pitched whistle.
They have a rattling chatter like a Magpie's, and a very loud, sudden,
harsh sound, not a screech, but what one might imagine to be the result
if three old gentlemen sneezed inharmoniously at the same moment,
while three others simultaneously gave vent to an expression of dis-
content and disgust! In addition to these melodies the cock inter-
sperses a curious " clik-cluk " with his comical display which consists
in stamping with one foot, getting very red in the face, erecting his
long, sparse crest, bowing and ducking his head, and looking sideways
up at his mate out of one eye.
The lutino Blue-fronted Amazon again raised my hopes by coming
into breeding condition in May and wanting to pair, but her mate,
the ferocious Koko, repeated his foolish trick of last year and dropped
into moult at the critical moment and would take but little interest

The Marquess of Tavistock --
in her. As he has the temper of a fiend where human beings are con-
cerned, I have now banished him and once more started the long and
troublous process of accustoming the lutino to a new partner. Koko's
departure, incidentally, was typical of his whole latter career. As the
net of Fate and of the aviary attendant descended upon him he found
time for a farewell injunction to his wife, " Give it him in the neck ! "
which she duly proceeded to do, swooping down on Yealland's back
and doing her best to scoop out a mouthful of flesh ! Until her character
was corrupted by Koko she was, with people, quite a meek and amiable
bird.
The Musky Lorikeets paired in early spring and I felt confident
of their breeding, but in spite of a great variety of nests being placed
at their disposal, they never took to any of them. The sexes of this
species are much alike, but the bluish tinge on the head of the cock
is more pronounced. They appear to thrive on Dr. Allinson's Food
and fruit and will eat a little spray millet. Their actions are not unlike
those of Trichoglossine Lorikeets but are more subdued, and they are
far less noisy. They play together occasionally and assume quaint
attitudes, but they are not nearly so grotesque in their behaviour as
Swainson's.
The worst tragedy of the season was that of the Porphyry-crowned
Lorikeets. A pair of these charming little birds passed the winter
successfully in an outdoor aviary with a heated shelter and came into
breeding condition in March when I provided them with a nest in the
shelter, for although I find that most young Parrakeets do far better
in a nest in the open flight, Lorikeets are sometimes an exception.
Three eggs were laid and three young hatched, but they did not thrive
and after a short time two died. I am afraid the food was not right
as the parents kept searching about, even in the grass, for something,
apparently, which they could not find. They had every kind of fruit
and green food I could think of, but I believe they would have done
better on Allinson's Food instead of sunbird mixture as they showed
a preference for it later on. The third young bird lingered for about
three weeks, but did not grow and then it also died. Two days later
the hen fell ill and looked like following her offspring. Careful nursing,
however, pulled her round and when returned to the aviary she seemed

in the best of spirits and likely to nest again. Soon afterwards, how-
ever, she fell ill once more, apparently with a slight chill. That evening
in the heated hospital she seemed quite all right again. Next morning
she was dead. A few days later the cock looked slightly ill. After
a day in the hospital he looked quite all right: next morning he was
dead. The post-mortem gave septicaemia in both cases.
The only other youngster to die in the nest was a hybrid which,
had it lived, would have been a first record.
A few years ago Mr. Ezra kindly gave me a Hodgson's Slaty-
headed Parrakeet. He appeared to be a very old bird with a constitu-
tion undermined by a long period of close confinement. He flew heavily,
grew, year after year, one yellow feather and one twisted feather in his
wing, and at first was very delicate and liable to minor ailments.
However, as time went by, he grew steadily more robust, but I
must confess I thought it most unlikely he would ever be fertile. I
nevertheless provided him with a hen Plumhead as a companion
and this year she nested in a box in the aviary flight and to my surprise
hatched one of her eggs, the rest appearing to have young dead in the
shell. The nestling survived until it was just beginning to feather.
Probably it never had a very sound constitution, but I find it impossible
to breed good Plumheads (or for that matter good King's or Crimson-
wings) except in a natural tree-trunk.
A very beautiful Sula Island King X Crimson-wing hybrid was
paired to a hen Crimson-wing and I quite hoped that they might have
young even though he proved infertile last year when still in immature
plumage. Although he was most attentive to his mate, the eggs,
however, again proved clear and I am afraid he is quite definitely
sterile in spite of the near relationship of his parents. The failure of
the eggs to hatch and their ultimate removal was a source of great
distress to him and his wife. It is quite pathetic to see the grief of
a male Polyteline or Aprosmictine Parrakeet when his expected family
fails to materialize. Cocks take the matter to heart far more than hens !
When the Crimson-wing laid a second time I gave her a fertile Ringneck
egg and they have reared their foster child most successfully and are
much attached to it.
Two other childless couples were less fortunate, though I did my

The Marquess of Tavistock --
best for them. One of these was a pair of Barrabands which last year
reared a young Bock Peplar. This season again their eggs failed to
hatch. When the eggs were due and overdue (not before) the cock,
whenever his mate came off, would go up to the entrance hole, put his
head inside and look and listen long and anxiously, then he would go
away and do something else, but about a minute later he would hurry
back and make another careful examination in the hope that a happy
event might have taken place in the interval! But, alas ! no little
squeaks greeted his ear and only the motionless white ovals were visible
in the darkness of the interior. When the eggs were taken away he
made such a fuss and was so completely miserable that his wife took
pity on him and (most unusual for a Barraband) laid a second time.
On this occasion the Rock Peplar eggs were forthcoming but they too
proved infertile so the poor Barrabands had no reward for their
perseverance. The Rock Peplar who provided the aforesaid eggs is
a source of much tribulation both to her owner and to her husband
who greatly desires a family. Neither his entreaties and anger nor
my inventive faculties can provide the wretched creature with a nest
that appeals to her and every season she finishes up by dropping five
eggs from the perch and then incubating that part of the perch from
which the eggs have been projected !
My hybrid Princess of Wales X Crimson-wing had a young Crimson-
wing of my own breeding as a companion. I did not in the least expect
her to nest as she is only, I believe, a year old and certainly not more
than two. Lay, however, she did.
Her first clutch proved infertile and was removed. If the Sula
Island hybrid and the Barraband took the disappointment of their
parental hopes badly it was nothing to the Princess of Wales hybrid.
He became absolutely frantic. At first he thought his wife had deserted
the eggs and drove her furiously about with torrents of bad language.to
make her return to her duties. When he realized that there were no
eggs to return to he spent the rest of the day fairly dancing with
vexation, flapping his wings, ruffling his feathers, cursing, grumbling,
and whining. At length he realized that the only thing to do was to
make another start and he spent the next three days with his head and
shoulders crammed inside the entrance of the nest, urging and beseeching

the Crimson-wing to try again. She did and we gave her a Rock Peplar
egg but the embryo died at an early stage. The undefeated hybrid
actually induced his young wife to lay a third time but she then felt
that she had done enough and on this occasion flatly refused to sit !
The old Sula Island King, mother of the hybrid previously referred
to, I mated with a Princess of Wales Parrakeet. Although she found
his courtship antics of leaping wildly to and fro over her head rather
disconcerting, she accepted him as a husband but the eggs were infertile.
He was bred in a fixed aviary by Mr. Astley and is, I fear, definitely
sterile as he has been a failure for many successive seasons with a
hen of his own species.
Great hopes were raised when the Queen of Bavaria Conures, some-
what unexpectedly, went to nest in June. Three eggs were laid and
although one was slightly damaged, the hen incubated the others
very faithfully for quite a month. Unhappily there has been no result.
My aviary attendant tells me that they carried a little grass into the
nest.
The Fairy Bluebirds again misbehaved. Two eggs were laid, one
of which was eaten after two days and the other deserted. It was
put into a Flycatcher's nest but a stoat made a clean sweep of the lot.
Very soon afterwards the hen went to nest again but became egg-bound,
an ailment to which the species seems somewhat liable. We saved
her but she would not sit. Malabar Parrakeets also had infertile
eggs, the cock possessing a maddening habit of biting off all his flight
and tail feathers just before the breeding season. I had the rather
tantalizing experience this year of having no less than six valuable
breeding hens, all anxious to nest and all without effective partners
or partners of any kind. They were two Malabars, a Layard, a Salvadori,
a Halmahera Hanging Parrot, and a Princess of Wales Parrakeet.
My big hen Banksian laid an egg and sat her full time without
result; she has now started again with a second egg. I fear her mate,
a Western Black Cockatoo, is also definitely sterile although, unlike
most tame birds of his species, he is a very attentive husband.
The Worcester's Hanging Parrot, paired to a fine cock Golden-
back, had two clutches of infertile eggs, the same as last year. In the
autumn of 1931 I thought her breeding days were over as she suddenly

The Marquess of Tavistock --
became a violent feather-plucker and, owing to the nature of her food,
a cure seemed rather hopeless. Fortunately, however, she did not
continue the vice and by the end of winter was again more or less
clothed.
Yellow-bellied Parrakeets made another rather unexpected but
unsuccessful effort at breeding. I had had the hen so many years
without her settling down to business that I had come to regard her
as rather a hopeless proposition.
The cock, a fine young bird bred by Monsieur Decoux, was extremely
anxious to nest about April and seemed annoyed at the hen's reluctance
to settle down to business. One day I found her a good deal knocked
about and denuded of patches of feathers so I separated them for fear
he should do her serious injury. A few weeks later I was surprised
to see her display when I happened to whistle to her so I returned the
cock to the aviary. They got on fairly well but their relations were
" winter " relations rather than breeding-season relations. He cleared
her out of the way when he examined the nest instead of politely
making way for her and waggling his tail as she inspected the hole
and also he never fed her. When she actually came into breeding
condition in June he had begun to moult and though she sat her full
time the eggs were infertile. I think that next year they will be all
right as, in spite of the failure of this year's nest, they seem more
friendly and on better terms than ever before.
With regard to new additions, among the more or less recent
arrivals the pretty little Fair Lorikeet has settled down well in his
outdoor aviary in company with an old Purple Sunbird. He is a very
active little fellow and scampers about with mouse-like agility. He
is rather nervous and on any hint of danger rushes into the aviary
shelter and pops into his sleeping-box out of the entrance to which
a few seconds later his head appears to take stock of the enemy.
Would that I could get him a mate !
The pair of Rothschild's Birds of Paradise have done very well
in their outdoor aviaries. The hen is in show condition and the cock
would be but for a few flight feathers damaged before he was turned
out. His great Whydah-like tail is now perfect and either that or his
wings make a curious silky rustling as he flies from perch to perch.

Though a little shy they are far from being birds of a skulking and
retiring habit and spend long hours morning and evening in the outside
flights in almost ceaseless motion. They eat nearly a whole apple
each a day in addition to other fruit, insectile mixture, mealworms,
and cockroaches. They are rather silent at present and what noises
they make are not unlike those of other members of the group.
After several unsuccessful attempts I seem to have got a cock
Amethyst Starling who looks like living. They, too, eat a lot of apple
but only the hen cares for insects. I found no difficulty in getting
them to agree.
A young cock Slaty-headed Parrakeet kindly given me by Monsieur
Delacour is slowly moulting into adult plumage. He seemed badly
cage-cramped on arrival and is still stiff in his legs and wings, but he
is improving steadily all the time.
A few weeks ago I obtained a mate for a lovely cock Eacket-tailed
Parrot that has wintered successfully in an outdoor aviary with a
heated shelter. The new female is also doing well but I am a little
afraid she is not Prioniturus platurus but one of the rarer and less
beautiful species. I did not see the introduction but am told that the
cock was delighted and spent a long time displaying to her, bowing
and opening his wings. He now feeds her and they do each other's
hair ! I am hoping that a movable aviary may be the solution to the
problem of keeping this uncertain-living species in good health. Among
the true Parrots it is as unique in the exquisite soft beauty of its
plumage as the Princess of Wales' and Bourke are among the
Parrakeets. The feathers are wonderfully smooth in texture and
there is no lovelier contrast than the bright, pale leaf-green of
the breast, the grey green of the wings, the gold of the region
of the nape, and the lavender of the crown set off by a little patch
of lilac pink. Last but not least are a pair of very beautiful
Sunbirds --Chalcomitra senegalensis. The hen has the humble brownish
plumage common to her sex and genus, but the cock is a gorgeous
creature, bronze brown with a glittering green patch on forehead
and throat and marvellous wine-red gorget with tiny blue spangles
like shot silk. I only hope that an open-air life with sunshine and live
insects will prevent this glory from fading to yellow or gold with the

his colour perfectly, thanks to access to an outdoor flight the whole
year round. He did not even require artificial light for feeding during
the long nights of winter.

It may be of interest to readers of the Avicultural Magazine
to relate here my experience with a cross of the Gallus sonnerati cock
and the Gallus bankiva female.
After several years of persistent search for someone who could
procure for me and ship to this country a few specimens of the Wild
Grey Jungle Fowl ( Gallus sonnerati ), labelled by some naturalist as
the wild cock of the British sportsman of India, I finally secured a trio
of these birds through the courtesy of my good friend Mrs. A. K.
Ansell, former Secretary of the United Provinces Poultry Association,
stationed at Lucknow, India.
Relative to the May shipment I am in receipt of a letter received
August, 1931, which states: " This species has become very rare.
I secured some but unfortunately most of them were received in a
most damaged condition and died, but I did secure a nice trio which
I dispatched to Calcutta to be sent on to you, but, unfortunately,
they were badly damaged on the train with all precautions taken.
One of them died and the two remaining were rendered lame and I had
to take them back. I will again put forth an effort to secure another
trio of the Grey Jungle Fowl and as soon as I get these birds I will
ship them on to you."
On 1st May of this year I received a letter from the Secretary,
United Provinces Poultry Association, 1 Sultanpur Road, Lucknow,
India, dated 12th April, 1932, which reads as follows : " Dear Sir,
I am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd of this month, 1932, and am
glad to inform you that before this letter reaches you, you will be in

possession of a trio of Jungle Fowl, Gallus sonnerati, which I have been
able to procure with the greatest difficulty. It is not that these birds
are not available but they are very hard to capture and die in captivity.
In this connection I have been put to a great deal of trouble and loss,
but I am glad I could send to you birds in which you are interested,
and am quite certain that with the precautions taken they will reach
you safely."
The next letter received from the Far East was from Balmer,
Lawrie &amp; Company, Ltd., 103 Clive Street, Calcutta, India, which
states : " Under instructions from the Secretary of the United Pro-
vinces Poultry Association we have shipped via S.S. Elmbank one crate
containing three wild birds to New York. We enclose herewith bill
of lading. Kindly arrange clearance from steamship and oblige.
Sufficient food for six weeks has been provided, and the chief officer
of the steamship has undertaken feeding during the voyage. Please
acknowledge receipt."
The above-named S.S. Elmbank arrived in New York on 24th May
and I received the birds two days later. Upon inspection at the rail-
road station I discovered one female missing, evidently thrown over-
board during the voyage of two months on the ocean. The other female
was in bad condition, the head badly battered and the bones of the
skull exposed. The male bird apparently in good condition.
These birds were placed in my aviary in which was also placed a
female of the Red Jungle Fowl. I quickly learned that the female
Grey Jungle Fowl was quite pugnacious, both she and the male
fighting the Red Jungle hen. Whereupon I removed the Grey
Jungle hen to another yard, after which the Grey Jungle cock
immediately began courtship with the Red Jungle hen. This female
laid twelve eggs and on 12th July hatched twelve chicks. Eleven of
these hybrids are living at this writing.
I placed in the same yard with this male another hen of the same
species ( Gallus bankiva). This bird laid ten eggs and is now hatching.
I believe all of these eggs to be fertile.
The young cross-bred chicks resemble in plumage pattern the pure
Bankiva chick, leg colour, however, being lighter, and at two weeks
of age showed considerable white in wing feathers.

A few notes on the breeding of some of my aviary birds may interest
members of our Society.
The number of young birds bred this year has been small compared
with previous years, but I really think I am pleased with the class of
birds bred. Previous years have always given me numbers of Bengalese,
Zebra Finches, Avadavats, and Goldbreasts, whereas now I have
succeeded in breeding and rearing my first young Shama, three Pekin
Robins, and two Pectoral Finches.
The Shama laid three eggs : one mysteriously disappeared, and one
young bird was taken out of the nest dead, owing to my running quite
out of mealworms for three days. I hunted for grasshoppers, cater-
pillars, spiders, and worms, and even found a few ants' eggs which
were always taken to the nest, together with bits of hard-boiled egg.
The parents seemed to eat nothing, they were so worried. Of course,
they were flying loose with the Pekins, but at the time the garden was
dried up and insects hard to find. Gentles they very much disliked,
although I tried three ways of cleaning them, viz., two days in biscuit-
meal, flour, and bran. The Pekins also did not take to them at all.
I don't blame them ! The hen Shama would fly into our dining-room
during lunch, 100 yards away from her aviary, and carry back bits of
omelette from off our plates.

Mrs. K. Drake--Some Breeding Results at Mylor , Cornwall 259
The young bird is strong on the wing and very sturdy. My thanks
are due to Mr. Thomasset for his kind letters of help.
I have had the mother Shama a year, and her mate only arrived
the middle of June, when I put him straight into the aviary on his
arrival. There was only a " scrap " at mealworm time, but he was
always a little gentleman and gave way most politely to her. Nest-
building began on the third day of their acquaintance. I left the main
door and a trap-door open all day till 9 p.m., then only closed the main
door as the temptation to vermin, etc., would be too great.
The Pekin Robins laid three eggs, and hatched and reared all.
I had no idea such tame birds could turn so vicious when the young
were out of the nest. Every day there was the same trouble, they
would fly at me on entering, and oh, the screaming and chattering !
All I could do was to stand perfectly still till their wild tantrums were
over. Of course, I always pretended never to see the young birds.
Sometimes they would all five fly about like lunatics, nevertheless,
I love them very much.
It seemed to me extraordinary to see the Shamas and Pekins so
friendly with each other ; each would enter the other's aviary and even
help itself to the other's food.
The Pectoral Finches last year made their nest in a box 6 feet
from the ground inside the shelter, but were not successful in rearing
their young. This year they built it in the open and under a primrose
clump, and reared two very fine birds. My Cordon Bleus
reared up to nine or ten days then forsook their young--as usual.
The four hybrids of the St. Helena X Orange-cheek that I bred
last year are to-day charming and lively birds and are greatly admired
by all who see them, also the Goldbreast x Avadavat hybrids, with
their strongly marked red eye-streaks and vivid scarlet-gold breasts
and the white dots of the Avadavat.

By Paul Kuntz, Winnipeg, Man.
For the past four years I have been devoting attention to the rearing
of Lovebirds. The part of my aviaries assigned to these birds is
12 ft. by 10 ft. by 7 ft. high, and is fitted with sufficient nest-boxes,
placed about 4 feet apart, to allow two boxes for each pair of birds,
two 10 lb. seed hoppers, and running water in a small fountain.
This is the breeding aviary ; in the winter the birds are kept in a warm
basement as our winters are much too severe for this family of birds.
In the spring of 1931 nine mated pairs of Lovebirds were placed
in the aviary : four pairs of Fischer's, two pairs of Nyasaland, one pair
of Black-cheeked, a male Fischer's mated with a Black-cheeked, and
a male Fischer's mated with a Nyasaland.
Keep Birds Busy
At first there were many squabbles and much minor fighting among
the pairs, but nothing serious resulted. However, after watching the
birds I came to the conclusion that the only way to have peace and
breeding success was to keep them busy and contented all the time.
With this end in mind I placed each day during the breeding season
a 5 or 6 ft. branch of maple or other tree bearing numerous
twigs and leaves, upright in a large jar of water, and found that this
solved the problem and produced the harmony necessary for success.
Every bird became engrossed in stripping off the leaves, twigs and
bark and was too preoccupied to notice what was going on around him,
so the quarrelling ceased as if by magic. I have counted as many
as twenty-eight old and young birds on one branch, contentedly
working away without a murmur from one of them.
Food
The two 10 lb. seed hoppers were filled with half canary and
half millet mixed. Apple, dandelion, lettuce, and seeding grasses
were given daily, and also bread soaked in water and squeezed dry.
Water is used in preference to milk as our high summer temperatures
rapidly cause the latter to sour. A constant supply of grit, sand, old

mortar, crushed egg-shell, and cuttlebone was furnished and once a
week the birds were given oats soaked in water.
Eggs Need Not Be Sprinkled
As a result of placing fresh, leafy branches in the aviary I discovered
that it was not necessary to sprinkle the eggs with warm water as I
had done previously. Every day the birds carried fresh green leaves
to their nest-boxes and these supplied the eggs with sufficient moisture.
Boxes containing young were also kept fresh and clean through this
practice. I am informed that some American predatory birds,
particularly Cooper's Hawk and the Broad-winged Hawk, always have
a supply of fresh green leaves in their nests when they contain eggs,
but this is not general amongst our passerine birds.

Banding Young
In my experience it was disastrous to put open aluminium rings
on Lovebirds. In the first place the bands on the market are not strong
enough for the purpose ; in the second the parents soon remove them,

but if they remain on, the young themselves in a couple of months
squeeze the bands flat and injure their leg ; in the third place it is
difficult to remove such rings.
I consider it essential to band young Lovebirds with closed aluminium
Budgerigar rings when they are twelve days old. If the tagging is
done sooner the adults remove the rings.

Since writing an account of the successful breeding of Bambusicola
thoracica, it is worth while recording the following : The hen Partridge
laid eight more eggs in the same aviary where the first brood had been
hatched, the young birds not having been removed from it. These
eggs were put under a Bantam and hatched on 8th August, and are
all doing well. Meanwhile the Partridge laid again, and brought off
her third brood of five more young ones on 19th August. Within twenty-
four hours the three young ones of the first brood, now nearly as big
as their parents, had each adopted one baby, the old cock taking a
fourth, leaving only one to be cared for by the female; the young ones
not only each brooded their special baby, but actually broke up
mealworms to feed them with. At night the whole party of ten birds
settled down closely wedged together. The only other example of
first brood birds feeding and brooding their younger brothers and
sisters of a second brood, is in the case of Moorhens, who will occasion-
ally do so, but it is not a very common occurrence. The old pair of
Partridges have, therefore, had three broods this summer, and laid
seventeen eggs. Of these one egg of the first lot was rotten, one young
bird was killed and eaten by another bird in the same aviary before
we could remove it, three young ones of the first brood have been fully
reared, seven more are doing well under the Bantam, and I see no
reason why this last lot of five should not be reared also.

A RARE SOUTH AMERICAN GROSBEAK
In last year's Magazine (pp. 4, 227, 289) there was some corre-
spondence about the very rare South American Grosbeak ( Neorhynchus
nasecus), in reference to one seen by Miss Chawner in Herr Stefani's
aviaries at Holzheim in Germany ; this bird had just arrived and was
considered a first importation. Rudolf Neunzig has recently written
an article on the species in Die gefiederte Welt, in which he says that it
was first imported in 1927 by Schondube of Berlin. A full account of
the plumage is given and a summary of the little known of it either
aviculturally or otherwise. A Herr Steinhagen appears to have had
eggs (Gef. Welt. 1928, 575), and according to a label on a skin in the
Berlin Museum we ought to believe that it had been bred, " von Herrn
Stefani gezuchteten ." We then read, ' 4 It is to be hoped that the lucky
breeder will quickly report his success," a hope we can all support.

Perhaps a few notes on the breeding of the above may be of
interest to some of our members. Here at Keswick Hall lived a fine
pair of these Parrakeets which, during the early part of the year,
were given an aviary to themselves. They quickly settled down
and we hoped we might induce them to breed during the summer.
They were given the choice of three nest-boxes, one a natural log
placed on a tree-trunk, one a large oblong box with concave bottom
made by a carpenter, and the third a small rough box made by myself.
During the latter part of March all three boxes were visited in turn,
but they chose the most unlikely of the three, the rough box. The
hen disappeared on 24th April but, the box being so small, her tail

was always sticking out of the entrance hole. She sat very well, I
cannot say how long, but at a guess should think about twenty days.
The cock was always close at hand, keeping watch. After a time I
could hear the sounds of young and, many days later, one morning
on going into the shelter to feed I saw a young Ringneck poke its
head out of the hole. I saw this performance every day for many
more days until 6th July when, going into feed, my little friend was
missing, and all seemed strangely quiet and still. I knew something
had happened. Going near the nest-box I tapped the bottom, but
still there was no response, and I thought the birds must be dead
and once more I should have to report failure. We bird lovers get
so many of these failures that we get used to them. I felt rather down-
hearted and was turning sadly away when, glancing into the open
flight, I beheld squatting in the grass a fine young Ringneck, nearly
as large as its parents. A few minutes later it was on the wing, flying
up to the perch alongside its parents. I wanted to rush off and tell
my employer to come and look at the sturdy youngster, so excited
was I. Another young one left the box two days later and they are
doing well. Although they are only common Ringnecks I was delighted
and they give me just as much pleasure as if they had been some much
rarer and expensive species.

THE PARSON FINCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983258047619048" page_id="56222131"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The Parson Finch (Pcephila cincta), also known as the Banded
Grass Finch and Black-throated Grass Finch, was at one time a very
well-known bird in European aviaries, but in recent years it seems to
have disappeared entirely and been replaced by the now familiar Long-
tailed Grass Finches (P. acuticauda and P. heclci).
Our plate shows the, at one time, common Parson Finch, with white
upper tail-coverts, and the much rarer Black-rumped Finch, which
appears to be its extreme Northern representative. So far as I am aware,
P. atropygialis has never been imported alive to Europe. The Parson
Finch inhabits Queensland and the adjoining parts of New South
Wales, whereas the Black-rumped form occurs in Northern Queensland
.and Northern Territory. In recent years I believe that all of the
Grass Finches that have been imported alive have come from the north-
west of Australia, which accounts for the presence in recent importations
of the Long-tails and others of the western forms and the absence
of the once familiar Parson Finch.
The Parson Finch was a jolly aviary bird, a free breeder though
.sometimes quarrelsome. Its habits, so far as I recollect, and I have
kept several, were almost identical with those of the Long-tail. In
fact the Long-tailed Grass Finch is an improved Parson Finch, with red
instead of black bill and elongated tail-feathers. The nest of the Parson

Finch is the usual bottle-shaped structure of grasses, but it will also
build in any suitable box or basket. In Dr. Hopkinson's Records he
writes of this species : " Easily bred, often many broods. When these
birds were commonly imported it was bred so often that success was
usually considered not worth reporting."

By Mrs. Dewar Murray
In 1931 my hen Blue Sugar-bird laid several eggs, mostly dropped
on the ground. Then she made a nest in some hay placed against the
aviary wall, lining it with wool and moss. The first egg was laid on
17th May and the second on the 19th. She sat her full time, but both
eggs were infertile. In 1932 the pair started looking for a nesting site
in the same place but would not build, so we made a small depression
in the hay and in this she started to lay. The first egg arrived on
16th June, the second being laid two days later. The hen sat steadily
until the 28th, when a young bird was hatched. Other eggs were fertile
but addled. Both cock and hen fed the chick for two weeks on bread
and milk, Mellin's food and honey and fruit, and above all mealworms,
which the hen took from my hand while on the nest and after chewing,
fed to her offspring.
After this the two birds tried to kill the baby, so I had to feed it by
hand--a performance which I successfully accomplished. It is now very
lively and, of course, feeds itself quite well.
The parents were hand-reared in Trinidad, and brought home by me,,
and are therefore perfectly tame. I think they will have more nests
and, I hope, do better next time. I should like to know if anyone else
has bred this species.

On a recent visit to Primley I was delighted to find that Mr. Whitley
has succeeded this year in breeding this beautiful Javan Pigeon.
After several unsuccessful efforts myself, I passed on my pair of birds
to him two years ago. Several times a young bird left the nest in my
aviaries, only to be neglected by the parents, who refused thenceforth
to brood or to feed it. Mr. Whitley has been more fortunate,
and doubtless more clever, and has reared a good young bird ; he
confirms my observations that the young leave the nest when only
a few days old and very small, in fact no larger than a Mannikin,
but able, nevertheless, to fly strongly. The difference in size between
the parents and the young bird is shown in the accompanying photo-
graph, taken at Primley.
I believe that this is the first breeding of this species in Europe.

Tastes may differ with regard to the beauty of the different colour
schemes which birds present for our edification, but to our mind
John Gould wrote in a particularly happy vein when he eulogized the
pleasing coloration of Barnard's Parrakeet. It is, moreover, a shapely
bird and not often bred in this country.
We have had our present pair for some eight or nine years, and
though attempts were made at nesting when we lived nearer town, it
was not till we were able to give them larger space--and incidentally
greater freedom from feline visitors at night--that they really seriously
went to nest, so that they have in each of the past three summers,
nested and reared a family.

This year, however, they have exceeded all past efforts, for the hen
laid a larger clutch (five eggs) than hitherto, and hatched and reared
all of them. This was more than we had even hoped for, because on
account of some infertile eggs in 1930 and 1931 we had since last
autumn had the hen flying with another cock bird, hoping for increased
fertility, and shut up the old cock Barnard in the shelter of another
aviary some 40 yards distant, only letting him out occasionally.
The hen, however, would have none of this, and as she was making
no attempt to nest, even five or six weeks after her usual date for going
to nest, we in despair put back the old male, with the result that she
started to lay some nine or ten days later.
As the male had been shut in for a good part of the winter, we were
very doubtful as to the fertility of any of her eggs, and were therefore
very pleasantly surprised when she hatched all of them.
We are uncertain to what extent her success depended on going
to nest later in the year, when the weather is better and the days longer,
and on the type of nest she used. Each year she has used a different
nest; first a large hollow tree trunk standing 7 feet high and partly
filled with earth with a layer of peat-moss on top ; last year a small box
in which both Redrumps and Manycolours have at different times reared
families, and where she laid on the bare wood ; this year, thinking that
a nest-box that would keep out cold or undue heat better might be
more acceptable, we constructed one of 2 in. wood, about 4 feet high,
partly filled with earth, and with a layer of peat-moss on top. Although
all three nests were in the flight, the hen had no doubts as to what she
wanted: she did not look at either of her old nests, but made straight
for the new one and used it with hardly any preliminary inspection.
Allowing three weeks for incubation, the young left the nest rather
earlier than usual--several days before the completion of the fifth
week, except the last one, which overstayed its time.
The young were comparatively easy to sex as they left the nest,
not only on account of the lesser size of the heads and beaks of the
hens (there were two), but also on account of the markedly duller
colouring, particularly of the green patches over the ears. What seemed
remarkable to us was the difference in colouring of the individual
young ; both the parents are of the ordinary, rather pale green (on

the upper breast and abdomen) type of Barnard, but some of the young
are quite of the darker type called by Matthews in his big work B.b.
whitei --indeed, no two of the young are identical in colouring, and the
crown of the head (for instance) varies from almost yellow in one to
dark green in others.
We have never seen the parents less concerned and worried over the
feeding of their family before leaving the nest; indeed, except for the
occasional disappearance of one or both parents, we would hardly have
known that they had a family.
The young were reared almost entirely on soaked hemp and
groundsel, canary seed and wheat (both soaked) were always available,
but not much used ; they were also given an occasional chop-bone
with fragments of meat on ; this last perhaps needs some explanation,
as it is, of course, rather unorthodox. We have noticed from time to
time that Barnards, Pennants, etc., eat earthworms, which they find
on the lawn in their flight ; now it seems rather derogatory for such
birds to be found eating earthworms, yet seems to suggest that food
of an animal protein nature is desired, moreover I have read some-
where--in Gregory Matthew's big work, I think--that Port Lincolns
used to settle on the camp refuse dump in Australia to make a feast
from the bones there, so we offered them a chop-bone. They seemed to
know what it was for, because they left all other food and devoured it
forthwith, bone and all, usually, but we did not give it very often,
about once a fortnight.
After the young had left the nest, and when green oats became
available these were given, and it was instructive to note the speed
and method with which they were devoured ; it made one sympathize
very much with the Australian farmer on whose field of growing or
standing corn a family of these or kindred birds may settle to feed.
What must it be when a flock of thousands (as it used to be) of the
much larger Roseate Cockatoo settled on his fields ? One can readily
forgive him shooting, trapping, or doing anything else he may think of
to compass their diminution, which no doubt seems a strange thing for
an aviculturist to say--but, after all, even the farmer has to live, and
it is a question of his living or theirs.
We are rather proud of our nest of Barnard's because we believe

that so large a nest has not been bred in an aviary in this country
before, though we know that about twenty years ago a similar nest
was recorded as obtained from birds at complete liberty. Apart from
the above, it has been an unusual year ; for the past three years each
of two pairs of Manycolours has reared a family, though sometimes
a small one, but this year neither of two pairs even laid an egg. Why ?
We don't know. They seemed to want each other's wives, for though
they were some 35 feet from each other, with intervening aviaries, they
could both see and hear each other, so we changed them over, and even
then they weren't happy.
Kose-breasted Grosbeaks (Z. ludovici) bred this year, hatching their
total of three eggs and rearing two, one of each sex. These are nice
birds; we could sex them seven days after hatching by the pink under-
wing colouring of the male. To our surprise both the young were out
of the nest on the tenth day, and did not return to it. Unfortunately we
have recently lost the young male, but the young hen seems to be larger
than either of her parents.
The Chinese Black-tailed Hawfinch (Eophona melanura) also
nested and laid three eggs ; these were very pretty and like large
editions of the egg of our common Bullfinch, only rather greener, but
they are evidently subject to considerable range of variation, as I see
that in 1916 the late Mr. Shore-Baily described some in his aviaries
as being almost exact replicas in colour and markings of our Yellow-
hammers. All three hatched, and we were in great hopes, as we think
this Hawfinch has not been bred in an aviary in England before, though
the larger Japanese Hawfinch has. However, we were disappointed,
for on the eighth day the parents removed and killed the rapidly
growing young, and though we thought they were going to nest again
they did not do so. They seem rather quarrelsome with each other
when nesting, and if the male came anywhere near the nest, as he
frequently did, when the hen was sitting she would leave her nest and
they would appear to be quarreling and scolding each other violently.
The male, in spite of his size, seemed to be rather henpecked.
Satyr Tragopans (one pair) laid nine eggs; seven of these were fertile
but four failed to hatch ; of the three which hatched one (we think)
over-ate himself with gentles, one was overlain by his foster-mother*

but the third (and last) is still with us and a very pretty chick and,
as I write, two months old. This tale of the Tragopans is horribly
reminiscent of the ten little nigger boys ; it is our first experience with
them, though we have previously reared many Golden and Common
Pheasants. The young one was reared on hard-boiled egg and biscuit
(pressed simultaneously through the perforated zinc bottom of a gravy
strainer to break it up' into small particles), plus chopped lettuce and
onion, and a few clean gentles only ; they seem to be vegetarians
mainly when young.
In the April issue of our Magazine Capt. Scott-Hopkins refers to
the male Tragopan as a Pheasant which he has never known molest
his wife ; perhaps ours is the exception that proves the rule, as he has
on two occasions severely mauled his wife ; indeed, we thought he had
finished her the second time. It was, we think, our fault in that we
coddled them too much and shut them in the shelter each night, where
the hen had no hiding-place. Since they have had continuous access to
both run and shelter and cover has been supplied there has been no
repetition of these attacks. Incidentally they never seem to use the
shelter. The hen nested and laid on the ground.
Other less noteworthy species have also bred and Gouldians are
only now starting. Like Mr. Teague, we have specialized in these
(since 1913) ; it was not only the first foreign bird we ever possessed
but also the first we ever bred; we have often bred them, but only in
small numbers. If only they could be got to go to nest earlier in the
year they would be one of the easiest of birds to rear. At Highgate
they almost always went to nest about 7th August, but here, possibly
because of the elevation and exposure, so far they have been three or
four weeks later. We once had one male put two hens to nest in the
same aviary: all the eggs hatched but it was late in the year and we
only reared a few ; we did not know then what we know now that if
you catch up the parents and place them and the nest in a flight cage
(" double-breeder ") they will carry on the good work of rearing their
young indoors in the dry with complete success. We have bred from our
English-bred males quite often, but it may be coincidence that, though
on five or six occasions we have had our own English-bred hens go to
nest and lay large clutches, they have never yet been fertile. We have

often noticed that cock Gouldians will not pair up with young hens
(i.e. just out of immature plumage), whether aviary bred or imported,,
if older hens are available.
A point of importance to the buyer of newly imported Gouldians
is not to give them grit or sand in their cages when newly purchased---
or only to do so for a few minutes each day. It must be remembered
that these birds are caught and collected in the north-west of Australia :
they then have a long journey to a port, usually Sydney or Melbourne,
and wait there till the remainder of a consignment is ready. This
may mean some, if not many, months in a trapper&apos;s travelling cage,
as the invariably overgrown state of their claws testifies. In order to
keep their plumage unsoiled and intact the trappers and dealers keep
them in travelling boxes with wire netting above the floors, so that no
sand or grit is available for them ; if, then, on arrival and purchase
in this country they are isolated and given unlimited grit, they eat
and continue to eat it, and so, in conjunction with the fact that they
now have unlimited food without having to compete for it in a crowded
travelling cage, get violent indigestion followed by acute enteritis,
which finishes them off in three or four days. When they are turned
out into the aviary they have other things to interest and occupy them,
and if the weather is favourable are not affected in this way.
We also possess a pair of Yulturine Guinea-fowl, wonderful birds,
everybody notices them ; each year the hen has laid in the aviary
flight which, we believe, is an unusual if not isolated instance.
Unfortunately they lay so late in the year--each time (twice) it has
been in August and September--when broody hens for fosters are not
usually available, and last year we did not hatch any, but we are
trying again this year and hope for some success, though I don't know
that we really expect it.
The question of vitamins and the nourishment and growth of young
birds is an intriguing one ; one feels there is such a lot that we don&apos;t
know. For instance, why, in a brood of Parrakeets, should some of
the young be vigorous and lusty and others rickety (is it really
rickets ?) ? All, obviously, must be fed on the same things, and they
are entirely cut off from sunlight (as a source of Vitamin D) till nearly
five weeks old ; is it because some are greedy--or better feeders--

and so get more of the necessaries of life ? We wonder. Comparable
cases have been recently recorded of human twins, identically fed ;
one has developed into a healthy and vigorous child and the other been
rickety. Why? No answer has so far been vouchsafed. But one notices
that with all sorts of birds, and such mammals as one has been able
to notice, that it is the greedy ones (the best feeders) that develop into
the finest and most vigorous specimens.
It may be noticed that the first person plural is freely used in this

been entirely unattainable had it not been for the interest and
co-operation of Mrs. Aviculturist with the writer, and so explains an
apparently dual personality.

ATTEMPTS TO BREED VIOLET-EARED
WAXBILLS

I am setting down these notes in the hope that any experience
and knowledge I have gained this season in my attempt to breed this
most beautiful of all Waxbills may be of assistance to members of the
Society and eventually lead to successful results.
The cock bird, one of a pair which I purchased from Mr. Frostick,
has been in my possession two years and nine months--the hen, which
was unacclimatized, I bought of Messrs. Gamage last winter. I have
kept the pair as hard as possible, using very little heat, but confined to
the bird-room until early May. The cock bird, a fine specimen, was
anxious to nest, and persisted to such purpose (although he was a long
time in selecting a site) that a nest was built early in June in their
winter quarters, a caged section of the inside aviary measuring 5 feet by
3 feet. The nest, roughly made in a branch, was placed fairly high, and
built by the cock unaided. The first clutch of four eggs was laid with,
so far as I know, an interval of a day between, the hen commencing to
incubate from the first egg laid and the cock taking his turn in sitting
on the nest.

<bodyText confidence="0.997886027777778" page_id="56222142"  page_num="274" year="" vol="">
From this nest three young were hatched and were deserted by the
parents--no attempts, so far as I know, being made at feeding. After
what seemed a very short interval, another nest was built in a box
in the same cage. To have every chance of success I determined to curb
my anxious interest, and not run any risk of disturbing them, not
even daring to peep into the nest, much as I desired to do so. About
the sixteenth day I noticed the cock eating an extra amount of ants'
eggs, and came to the conclusion that the nest contained young. He
confined his diet to ants' eggs the first four days (which were those of the
large pine wood ant, and were supplied to him absolutely fresh). After
the four days their feeding consisted of millet well soaked ; this went
on to about the tenth day, when I discovered one morning a well-
developed bird (the only one) thrown out on the floor of the cage.
I subsequently found another egg, still in the nest, showing traces
of slight germination, and I imagine this had got chilled. I am
at a loss to account for the misfortune with the young bird unless,
indeed, with these breeding-shy birds, I made an error, previous to
going out for the day, in taking the gardener into the bird-room to
give him some instructions during my absence. He had not previously
been in the room, and it was soon afterwards that I discovered the
tragedy.
My success in getting so far was due, in my opinion, to the fact that
I confined the pair when nest-building to the caged section of the
bird-room, and denied them the liberty of the flight, thereby giving
them little opportunity of dividing their attentions from the object
in view and leaving them entirely to themselves. Although mine are
a very tame pair of birds, I imagine that birds of this species are very
jealous of their nest and resent even a glance at it. The other important
point, I think, is to see that the ants' eggs are given to the birds
absolutely fresh.
My St. Helena's have done well this season. The pair that reared
a nest of seven last season have reared another nest of six, which were
fed by the hen, the cock unfortunately dying during the rearing stage.
From another pair I have reared two young and they have now a nest
of six eggs.

A few years ago when Parrots " and all Parrot-like birds " were
found to be carriers and distributors of that terrible and fell disease
"Psittacosis", and when, according to the columns of the various
"Daily Liars ", so many thousands of the human race were being swept
to an untimely death by the said dread malady, Derby possessed
a solitary but well-worn park, namely, " The Arboretum," where on
sunny days the countless offspring of the population of the surrounding
sordid streets were pushed in perambulators by their slightly elder
brothers or sisters as the case may be, to enjoy the sickly rays of the
sun which managed to penetrate the pall of smoke and mist which
usually hangs over this noble city.
In a dark corner of the above-mentioned green oasis stood three
aviaries, one constructed out of a derelict tramcar, but all sadly in
need of repair. One contained a few rabbits and many mice; the others
contained, as well as mice, a few Pigeons, a sickly Peafowl, and about
seven or eight Cockatoos which, in the days when they flew under the
blue skies of Australia, were white, but after many years of incarceration
and following the law of evolution, had taken on the colour of their
surroundings--a raiment of sooty grey.
Now we are blessed in this happy city of ours with very able and
conscientious municipal authorities who, above all else, have the
welfare of the citizens at heart.
When the outbreak of " Psittacosis " occurred consternation reigned.
The citizens of Derby must be protected at all costs. Such minor things
as smallpox, tuberculosis, bad drains, stopped-up sewers, and other such
trifles were forgotten. Humanity must be protected from this new and
terrible scourge.

Sydney Portci--The Story of a Quaker Parrakeet
Notwithstanding that several of the Cockatoos were almost about
to qualify for the old-age pension, and also that several had been given
by the writer of this article, these deadly birds met the fate which no
doubt they richly deserved--they were all shot ! And so the population
of Derby was saved--or at least nearly so.
Knowing the Socialistic tendencies of my family, it was a great
wonder that the local Press did not discover in my action of giving the
birds to the said " Arboretum " a sinister Bolshevik plot to annihilate
the rest of the peaceful inhabitants of the town by the introduction of
these death-dealing feathered fiends who, every moment of their
lives, breathed millions of the deadly " Psittacosis " germs into the
pure air of Derby. At all events, my sinister designs were thwarted--
no one died of " Psittacosis ". Possibly the wind was always blowing
in the wrong direction, or the air of Derby was too pure ! Or possibly
it may have been due to the ignorance of the local medical fraternity,
for we are told by certain eminent medical authorities that
" Psittacosis " is practically indistinguishable from pneumonia: so in
their lack of knowledge, not having had to deal with the disease before,
they may have diagnosed many cases as pneumonia.
When this malady was so rampant (in the columns of the Press)
many a village doctor was called in to visit a sick child ; if the symptoms
were difficult of diagnosis the doctor would ask : " Have you a Parrot
in the house ? " " Why, yes, the one wot Uncle Sam brought from India
when he came home on leave." There was a grave consultation. The
child had " Psittacosis ". Polly's death-knell was rung, so was the
pretty green neck. Humanity must be saved, even though the child
does beg for her pet to be saved, but what are the tears of a child to
the fate of a nation ?
I am quite sure that I must have had several attacks of
" Psittacosis " in the days when it was so fashionable ; how could
I escape when I kept dozens of Parrots ? but the unenlightened doctors
always declared it to be pneumonia. Still what did it matter, I never
did like to be in the fashion where ailments were concerned, and no one
would have been able to satisfy their sadistic desires, for I would never
have let any of my Parrots be destroyed.

a look-in yet. There was also another inhabitant of the Cockatoo's
aviary, of course not counting the mice, a little Grey-breasted Quaker
Parrakeet. In their gross ignorance the ones in authority thought this
bird too small to communicate the disease to the inhabitants of the
town over which they watched so fondly. If they had only have known
or communicated with the Minister of Health on the subject, they would
have found that " every Parrot-like bird ", whether a Love-bird,
a tiny Parrotlet, a giant Macaw, or even a familiar Budgerigar, was
tarred with the same brush. So our little Grey-breasted friend was sold
for a few shillings to a local bird dealer. Months passed ; the little
prisoner remained in its tiny cage with no perch at all, for "what was
the good of giving a Parrot a perch to stand on when it bit it up every
time ? " No, it had to be taught a lesson--that perches were to stand
on and not to chew up. Now the inhabitants of Derby are renowned
for their wisdom in spite of the old adage which says : " Derbyshire
born, Derbyshire bred, strong in the arm but weak in the head." So,
of course, no one with any sense would take such a death-dealing
creature as a Parrot into the modest and aspidistra-decked parlours
of Derby.
We passed the poor captive each day on the way to the office, and
after a time my brother decided to risk the fate of an untimely death
from " Psittacosis " and purchase it for 5s. or so. But justice will not
be thwarted, as you will learn later on.
We had no Parrot-cage to spare, and as Quaker Parrakeets have
a sinister reputation for pugnacity we did not care to put it with our
other Parrakeets. So we gave it a free run of the bird-room, but it
proved itself a real nuisance. With a beak like a pair of pliers, it soon
cut through the wire netting into the other aviaries and caused much
consternation amongst the inhabitants.
One day the door of the bird-room was left open and down the stairs
and out of the door flew our little friend. I didn't bother very much
for, knowing the neighbours, I knew that word would soon be brought
if it were located in the vicinity of Old Normanton. A few hours after-
wards there was the inevitable, " Have you lost a bird ? " " Yes,
I had." So " Polly " was brought back. I told the finders that they
could keep him: but no, the dread menace of "Psittacosis " was still

in the air, so back he came to the bird-room. He escaped once again,
but this time stayed in the orchard. We put a cage out containing
a hen St. Thomas' Conure, whose mate had died. This brought our
little friend back, and with a new love he wandered no more and was
content to let the fence of the orchard be the boundary to his little
world. He fell in love with the little Conure. To protect her from the
vulgar prying gaze of the public he built her a bower ; he wove and
wove, day in and day out, a wall of twigs on every side of her cage.
His work was amazing. He wove with the skill of an accomplished
basket-maker. From morning to night he flew back and forwards from
the damson-trees from which he plucked the slender twigs, to the cage
containing his lady love. Alas, just as this labour of love was nearly
completed, a sinister black feline preyed upon his little mate ! After
this the orchard fence no longer became his boundary, he reconnoitred
the neighbourhood, and in time his shrill shrieks could be heard from
a great distance. The neighbours accepted him ; he visited them in
turn, and most of them fed him and petted him. Sometimes he ate
their fruit, yet no one seemed to mind ; but he always knew his home.
I still had the usual messages : " Have you lost a bird, mister ? " But
in time the messages became fewer, for everyone got to know him.
I had only to whistle and with a distant answering shriek he would
come with swift and graceful flight, quick as a flash of lightning. At
the beginning of the cold weather he found his way back into the bird-
room, where it was warm. He spent the autumn nights there, but he
was always off again as soon as the door was opened in the morning.
In the evening he would come up to the house and shriek and chatter
until someone came out and went down to the bed-room to let him in,
but just to make sure that they really knew the way he would fly down
with them, going from tree to tree chattering all the time until the
door was opened. But on the approach of winter he hardly went out
at all. If the day was cold and dull a few circles round the
orchard would suffice, but if the day was fine he would stay out for
several hours.
On the approach of spring his stays out became longer and longer,
and finally he ceased to roost in the bird-room altogether ; but he
never quite left us.

Last summer my brother took pity on a poor decrepit Alexandrine
Parrakeet, another long-suffering prisoner from the same shop that the
Quaker Parrakeet came from. This bird was also placed in the orchard
in a cage to accustom it to the surroundings before letting it free. The
bird was a male, so that its reception was not quite as warm as that of
the little St. Thomas' Conure ; still, in time the two birds became
friends, and soon our little friend was at his old job of turning the cage
into a wicker basket. This time his efforts were not appreciated, and
the Alexandrine wandered off, never to be seen again.
Our little friend developed a great antipathy for the Starlings
which used to visit the garden ; he chased them off the lawns, he used
to wait for them going into their nests under the eaves of the house,
in fact he would keep the parents away from their nests for hours..
One saw these poor patient creatures on the various gables of the house
or on the tops of the surroundings trees with beaks full of grubs or
worms, waiting until such times as the Parrakeet grew hungry and had
to go to his seed-tin, then there would be a concentrated dash on the
fond parents' part to reach their offspring before their enemy came
back. There was one particular Starling for which he cherished a great
hatred ; he would remain by her nest for hours, and if she came
anywhere near he would chase her miles away.
In time after the Starlings had left he selected a site for his nest m y
this was a sheltered position under the eaves at an angle of the house.
The foundations were built on a support which held the telephone
wires. His energy was tireless ; all day he flew to and from a black
poplar-tree, where he cut the branches for his nest. Sometimes the
branches were so large that they almost weighed him down in his
flight. The nest grew apace until it was quite a bulky structure. At
last I secured a mate for him, a young bird which had been bred in
the country, and we had visions of flocks of young Quaker Parrakeets
around the house.
The day before the new arrival was due we missed him, but had no
doubt that he would turn up again. At the week-end I was in London ;
a message came to the house, " Had I lost a Parrot ? " Why, yes.
They went for him--they found him lying in a hedge with one wing
shattered. Some gentleman--we called him quite a different name at

THE TRAIL THAT IS ALWAYS NEW

<bodyText confidence="0.999613045454545" page_id="56222148"  page_num="280" year="" vol="">
This is the attractive and most apposite title chosen by
Mr. Willoughby Lowe for his reminiscences of forty years' bird-
collecting, which has just been published by Messrs. Gurney and
Jackson (price 16s.), a wonderful record of travel and observation of
nature (particularly bird-life) in North America, the East, Tropical
Africa, and elsewhere, which must interest everyone who can enjoy
a well-written account of happenings in such places, and happenings
which are not the common lot, though all in the day's work, of the
man whose business brings him into such close touch with wild nature.
The book is a regular O.D.T.A.A. (to borrow the title of a fairly recent
and enthralling adventure story), but with this great difference : " the
things " which fill the Trail are not the hair-raising adventures of the
novel, but a series of word-pictures of bird and other wild life inter-
spersed with descriptions of the ordinary daily life of a collector, though
the events would hardly be ordinary to most of us, and above all, as
Mr. Bannerman says in his preface, accuracy is stamped on every page,
and the whole made interesting by one whose wide experience has made
him a master of his subject and whose book now shows how competent
he is to pass this experience on to others with interest.
One of Mr. Lowe's temporary retainers in West Africa put the case
well, when he said : " Dis Lo, he savvy tings too much. He know all

When one has read the book one realizes that it is just as true that
the author can make bush-life also almost come to life again.

A HYBRID MACAW IN NEW ZEALAND
Further to the details of the breeding of a hybrid Macaw, Red and
Yellow ex Blue and Yellow, recorded by Mr. Anderson in the September
number (page 220), I am forwarding you a photo of the two parent
birds with the young one in the centre (see page 282).
The present size of the bird is 33 inches from head to tail.
I trust you will be able to publish this, as it is definite proof of the
breeding.

Last year I had the good fortune to get a pair of these beautiful
Parrakeets. They were turned out into a large aviary in May, a few
weeks after their arrival. They promptly went to nest, and reared four
beautiful young birds. The parents were perfect in their attention to
their young, and I did not have a moment's anxiety about their young
being reared. I may mention that these birds came to me with a bad
reputation, as they had always failed to rear their young in Australia.
I thought the long sea voyage and thorough change had cured them

of their bad habits, and as they had successfully reared four young last
year expected equal success this year. In this I was mistaken, and their
behaviour has been dreadful as will be seen from the following results.
They went to nest on the 15th April, when the first egg was laid. In all
four eggs were laid, the last one on the 21st. Four young were hatched
out on the 5th May. One young was found dead in the nest, and the other
three were found dead in the long grass in the aviary. As the weather
was cold, I blamed it for these poor results. The birds went to nest
again, laying three eggs between the 18th May and the 25th. Two young
hatched out by the 8th June. One young was dead in the nest, showing
signs of having been killed, and the hen Parrakeet was seen carrying
the other young about in her beak--dead. This was most disappointing
after my easy success of last year, and it looked as if the birds had gone
back to their bad habit of not rearing their young.
I removed the birds into another aviary, where I gave them two
nest-boxes--one in the flight and the other one inside the aviary shelter.
They again went to nest, in the box inside the aviary shelter, and by
the 21st June had laid three eggs. One young hatched out on the
9th July, which was killed on the 11th. The other two eggs
were unfertile. All these failures looked as if these birds would only
rear their young after another long sea voyage, and I was not prepared
to send them on one now. I felt certain that the cock bird was blame-
less, and that the hen was the culprit. As the cock was devoted to the
hen and had spoilt her thoroughly by feeding her incessantly when
she was sitting, I thought I would punish her the next time she laid
by moving the cock bird away from the aviary and letting her fend
for herself. She went to nest again, and laid four eggs by the 25th July.
I removed the cock bird after the hen had been sitting for about a week.
This made the hen come off the nest pretty often to feed herself, as
her husband was no longer there to spoil her. Two of the eggs were
unfertile, but one young was hatched out on the 12th August and the
other on the 14th. These two young were perfectly fed by the hen, and
thoroughly reared: no mother could have been more attentive to her
young. I wonder if the same treatment will be successful next year,
or if I shall have to try and think out some other plan. It will be
interesting for members to know that the two hens I bred last year

Re N. Nicholson's article on Bluebirds. It is not generally known
that to transfer eggs from one bird's nest to another, the eggs must
be same date as those in the nest to which they are removed. Say a wild
Robin completing its clutch on 5th June, the eggs placed in nest on
5th June must be clear, otherwise the foster-parents will not accept
them. This, I believe, is the solution of the failure.

FURTHER NOTES ON PHEASANTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996554368421053" page_id="56222152"  page_num="284" year="" vol="">
On opening the Magazine for September I found it was a number
after my own heart, as it contained not only an article on Pheasants,
but also two other articles on Game Birds and Waterfowl, so I shall not
be able to complain that my particular fancies are being neglected for
some time to come. I never suspected, however, that the quite
inoffensive article I wrote would be the means of inducing my friend
Paul Lambert to write an article introducing paragraphs more suitable
for Punch than an avicultural magazine.
Regarding Mr. Lambert's remarks. In the first place, the order in
which I gave the Pheasants was the average of voting of about a dozen
naturalists, and not my personal vote, although I remarked that it
was a very sensible selection, especially for those who were seeing many
kinds for the first time. Mr. Lambert knows that my selection is the
pure Amherst cock first, and the rest among the also ran. I really could
not decide how to place the Golden, Reeves, Satyr, and Tragopan,
but this week I had visitors who thought the Reeves beat them all.
Of course, if you want to be a high-brow, you can say you prefer a Silver
or Ring Neck, or any other that is not very brilliantly coloured. The
ugly walk and carriage of the Impeyan puts it out of the first six in

<bodyText confidence="0.993475111111111" page_id="56222153"  page_num="285" year="" vol="">
my opinion. The Amherst cock is a combination of colour, shape, and
style that is not quite equalled in any other Pheasant.
Now, with regard to my suggestion that Tragopans require more
exercise, anyone would think from reading Mr. Lambert's article
that we know everything about Pheasants. The fact is we know very
little. Poultry are closely related to Pheasants, and we know that when
they are kept in small enclosures it is necessary to make them work by
scratching for their food, in order to get them to lay well. Birds like
Amhersts, Golden, Swinhoe, Beeves exercise themselves, but
Tragopans, from what I have seen, lead a rather lazy life. I have also
read that Tragopans often die suddenly as the result of being too fat,
so that anything that will cause them to take more exercise would most
likely improve their fertility. There is no doubt that crooked toes
in Swinhoes are the result of weakly chicks that come from inbred stock.
It would be most interesting to know when the last Swinhoes were
imported, and also how many were formerly imported direct from
Formosa.
There is still plenty of scope to investigate the habits and food of
the different Pheasants. Mr. Horne's book mentions that hempseed
is harmful to Beeves. Has anyone else noticed this ? I consider hemp-
seed to be one of the very best foods for Pheasants if given in
moderation.
I wish we could have some more experiences on rearing rare
Pheasants. We have some members in Scotland who could perhaps
enlighten us on rearing Tragopans, and how to get Beeves to lay. We
have also members in U.S.A., such as Mr. Henley and Mr. Corson,
who have wide experience in rearing rare Pheasants.
In digesting articles written on experiences in other countries,
one must always allow for the difference in climate. I am pleased to
read of the success of Mr. J. Carlton Hunting in rearing Bornean
Firebacks. Anything like this is of intense interest to Pheasant
breeders, and adds greatly to our knowledge. It is certain that in the
near future many species of Pheasants will become extinct in the wild
state, and now is the time to experiment and see how these birds can
be saved for posterity by being reared in captivity.

journals, all kinds of virtues and vices are attributed to this bird. Now,
why on earth should any bird bred from ordinary King-necks have
different habits to its parents ? According to this a Black Leghorn
should have different habits from a White Leghorn. All birds of the
same breed differ slightly individually, and this is also the case with the
Melanistic. To claim it is hardier and a better flyer and stayer than its
parents is pure imagination, or else a case of the wish being father to
the thought.

I thought it might be of some little interest to members to know that
I have just received a small consignment of rare birds, including eight of
the very rare Norfolk Island Parrakeets, which are reputed to be nearly
extinct. Judging from the number which I have received in this last
twelve months, thirteen in all, this cannot be so. I have also received
a pair of the wonderful Fijian Red-shining Parrakeets and seven
Norfolk Island Green-wing Doves, a species not imported before. The
Norfolk Island Parrakeets arrived in almost show condition, and very
tame, which speaks well for the care taken of them during the many
thousands of miles they travelled, for they came from Norfolk Island
to Auckland and then via Cape Horn to London.
I have been trying hard to breed from two Norfolk Island Parrakeets
all summer, but found that the supposed hen was a young cock. The
only hen I received in the first consignment I let a fellow member have,
and I heard that this bird is breeding. Perhaps we shall hear something
later from the very able pen of the owner.
I am shortly leaving for New Zealand, where I hope to reside in
some of the more remote parts, and study the unique avifauna of those
islands.
I also hope to visit some of the more remote islands, such as
Antipodes Island, Chatham Island, and possibly Norfolk Island.
I was hoping to be able to let members either have on loan or at the
cost of importation several pairs of the Norfolk Island Parrakeets
to try and breed from, but with the tightening of the foolish restrictions

BIRD LICE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976692" page_id="56222155"  page_num="287" year="" vol="">
The letter of Mr. G. H. Gurney in regard to the bird lice is very
interesting, in so much that I have had several similar experiences
where birds have died owing to these wretched parasites.
The first bird I lost was a cock Swainson's Long-tailed Jay: the bird
gradually got weaker and weaker, and in spite of everything possible
being done it died. Immediately after death the body was covered
with these tiny lice. They evidently felt the body becoming colder, so
started on a general exodus to find a fresh victim. The second bird
I lost was a Yerreaux Glossy Starling, and when handled the lice
swarmed over my hands and arms evidently thinking they had found
a fresh host.
Now if any of my birds appear the slightest unwell I closely examine
them, looking at the base of the wing- and tail-feathers for I find that
the lice are found in the greatest quantity under the underwing- and
tail-coverts.
A sure cure is to immerse the bird in a bath of a strong solution of
quassia, using J lb. of the chips to 2 quarts of water ; the birds' beak
should, of course, be held out of the water. This kills the lice instantly,
and they float in a brown scum on the top of the water.
As the birds which are usually infested with these lice are in a weak
condition, it is necessary to keep them warm until quite dry.
I have only found these parasites on c ' soft-bills Speaking of
another subject, I wonder if any reader would care to give a good home
to a very tame Abyssinian Coucal, which is slightly lame.

Will slugs, the large ones, eat young birds alive ? I firmly believe
they can and do. Two young Pekin Robins, on leaving their nest,
went to sleep on the cement floor under the shelter, and I found them
badly eaten and slug slime all over them, although they were perfectly
fit the night before at 9.30 p.m., fast asleep, and were fed well. Now,
yesterday at 5.30 a.m. I saw another one half-way up a bush with a huge
grey slug eating the little chap up, just dead. I have noticed the same
thing happen to the small Gold-breasts, etc., when they sleep in bushes
near the ground. Quite well at night, and in the morning dead at foot of
bush and sometimes carried a yard away with the slug on it, and showing
the trail as well from the bush. The birds seem mostly to be tackled
about the region of the heart. At night the birds appear to grip very
firmly (since I could not move a baby Shama from his outside perch until
he woke up and it took a few seconds before he released his clutch of the
twig), and also sheer fright would probably make them grip harder
in the dark night. I feel positive now that those little Peter's Fire-
finches died the same way, as I have had no trouble from all the birds
in that division since ; no kills.
I have had visits from the vile Sparrow-hawks and Kites. 1 I get
" fed up " sometimes with their kills and the shocks they cause
the birds.

A PROPOSED STOCK BOOK FOR RARE SPECIES
Why is there no form of avicultural stock-book to control the
breeding of very rare Parrakeets ? I am told that Bourke's,
Turquoisines, and other birds which are being bred in this country
now are either extinct or so rare in their native country that no more
are likely to be imported. Surely there is a great danger of this limited
stock becoming inbred, sterile, and finally extinct. I am a complete

tyro myself, but I would venture to suggest that it is the duty of the
Avicultural Society to institute some sort of stock book, so that any
breeder may discover if his birds are really unrelated or not. This need
not be an expensive innovation. Only one or two copies need be kept,
and from these suitable pairing, etc., could be arranged by some
central authority appointed by the Council. A satisfactory system of
ringing and registration could easily be evolved by those aviculturists
(and there must be some) who are skilled in such matters. Only
co-operation among the eminent aviculturists who breed these rare
birds would be needed. Every single specimen of those species alive
in this country would have to be ringed and registered. Zoos and
exhibition collections could co-operate by using for purely exhibition
purposes only those birds which were sterile or unfit for breeding.
Persons who co-operated in the scheme would have the satisfaction of
knowing that they were doing a really useful and valuable work. I feel
sure that some such scheme as I have outlined above is the only method
by which stocks of rare and extinct birds may be preserved for the
future. A. Morrison.

Mr. W. H. Workman in the April number of the Magazine gave us
advice about curing gapes in birds. I am most grateful to him, as I have
successfully treated six Starlings, among them Rothschild's, Crowned,
and Spreo. In each case the cure has been complete, and I am sure
most aviculturists will be more than grateful to Mr. Workman. For
several years I have had this trouble with my Starlings. They first
started by sneezing and coughing now and again, and then gradually
got worse, and died very often after two to three months--no matter
what I did to them they never recovered. I tried giving them all sorts
of different stuffs in their food and water, and I have even painted their
throats with iodine, but all to no purpose. I write this to help others
who may have the same trouble with their starlings. I may mention
that so far only Starlings have had this complaint--" Kuride " can be
obtained from the Kur-os Manufacturing Co., Church Street, Ballymena,
Ireland. A. Ezra.

People who keep tropical Starlings are sometimes troubled by
a mysterious and fatal disease which attacks these birds. They start
.sneezing, and although they feed well and live a long time they usually
die at the finish. I have for some time suspected gapes to be the cause,
although friends with more experience of Starlings than I have not
agreed with the diagnosis, it being often difficult to see how the birds
could have been infected. The other day a correspondent wrote to me
for advice about a Royal Starling which exhibited the characteristic
symptoms. I urged a post mortem if&apos; the bird succumbed, as it did, and
sure enough it proved to be heavily infected with gapeworms.
Tavistock.
[The common Starling is also frequently infected with gapeworms
(-Syngamus ), and is a common source of infection in other birds such
us game birds and poultry. The remedy, first recommended by
Mr. Workman, and found so successful by Mr. Ezra, should be tried by
all who suspect gapes in young or adult captive birds. --Ed.]

It should be of interest (to aviculturists, at any rate) to draw
.attention to a slip in the Zoo List of Birds (1929). 1 This is the omission
of the Combasous (Hypochera) , somewhere about p. 49, and the inclusion
instead of Malimbus nitens on p. 74.
Combasous are always with us ; the common one, chalybeata (late
nitens) can nearly always be seen in the Bird House small seed-eaters'
aviary ; and the Zoo have also had the South African and Eastern
races, ultramarina and amauorpteryx, and perhaps others. Malimbus ,
on the other hand, I cannot believe they have had, for it is a forest-
haunting, insect-eating Weaver from Cameroon and other parts of

Equatorial West Africa, which I feel sure has never been imported and
probably never kept in captivity even in its own country, except
perhaps for a day or so by Mr. Bates' native catchers.
This Combasou -Malimbus confusion can be almost certainly
attributed to the name " nitens ", and the slip will possibly intrigue
some future inquirer and furnish proof that the learned compiler of
this most useful list was no bird-fancier ; or, as I suppose I ought to say
here, no aviculturist.

I read Mr. G. Beever's article on " Pheasants and other Birds ,y
in your July issue with a great interest. I have had Monaul and
Tragopan Pheasants in the Zoological section here for the last seven
years. The maximum temperature in the shade here is about 112 in
the hot weather, but it can go higher ; this year it reached 118. The
Monauls and Tragopans arrive here for sale, having been brought from
Lucknow or Calcutta in small wickerwork basket cages which are so
small that the birds' heads and tails get badly damaged by rubbing
against the baskets. They usually arrive here at the beginning of the
hot weather, and although I know that these high elevation Pheasants
do not live well in this climate, I purchased them because they are
attractive exhibits and I know that on the journey from Jaipur to the
next place where they could be sold they would probably die. They
are only brought away from Calcutta when the dealers think they are
likely to die because of the heat. These thoroughly unsound birds live
with me from six months to two years. My aviary encloses two very
large trees, and I notice that both Monauls and Tragopans remain in
the trees most of their time. I had trouble with the Monauls' beaks,
growing too long to enable them to pick up their food. I got over this
by burying their food daily under about 3 inches of fine shingle and
sand mixed. I have never seen any indication of these Pheasants
wishing to go to nest, although in the same cage I have had eggs from

The date of the first live arrival of a rare bird is always of interest
and that of the Birds of Paradise particularly so, as for most the dates
are comparatively recent, and in many cases can be fixed almost to
a day. The accepted date of the first importation of any member of
the family to England (if not to Europe) is 1862, when Dr. Wallace
brought two Paradisea minor to the Zoo (see Aviculture , vol. i, p. 22).
A record of a much earlier arrival, however, can be found in Latham's
General History of Birds, 1821-4, where about twenty species of
Paradise Birds are described. Here, under the Greater Bird of Paradise
(P. apoda), there is a note (vol. iii, p. 183) contradicting the statement
in the text that "it is said that they cannot be kept alive by art ",

which reads : " The late Mr. Pennant furnished us with an instance
to the contrary from Sir Joseph Banks ; one of them having been
brought alive to England.-- Ind. Zool., 4do, note x."
The authorities are unimpeachable, and unless they and Latham
are grievously mistaken, here is a record of a live arrival before 1821.
It would be of interest to look up the reference to the Indian Zoology
for further details.
Another rare first arrival also to be found in Latham is that of the
Swallow Fruit-eater, Tersa tersa (Linn.), 1 which must be one of the rarest
of imported Tanagers. The only example I have seen was the bird in
the marvellous collection of Ecuador birds brought home for Mr. Brooks
by Mr. Goodfellow during the War and housed for a few days at the
Zoo on their way north to Hoddam. It was not then " new to the
collection ", but I think that the Zoo had only had it once before, and
that it has never been seen over here since. Latham, however, gives
a wonderfully good coloured plate of the species under the name
Lindo Chatterer, and says that he saw one alive at Mr. Bailey's, the
Haymarket bird-dealer of that time.

THE CRESTED DOVE AT LARGE
In The Field of 8th October the Duchess of Bedford writes : " The
Australian Crested Dove was imported to Woburn (Beds) more than
twenty years ago. They bred in the open and increased, very much
for a time, then almost died out; but in the last few years have again
greatly increased."

I did manage to reach home safely with some of them, though not all.
I have now two lovely Tanagers I bought from this man--both are
the size of Blackbirds--one the colour of Eton blue and the other a
darkish shade of green. He caught me lots more but these are the only
survivors of the Tanagers he got me. He is absolutely honest, and
an absolute topper to deal with, and can speak English. I gave him
an order for #5 worth of birds, and the market value of them in this
country is prohibitive, but if you can get them home, in the spring,
and have a nice warm sheltered aviary, it is well worth having a shot
at it. I should like to add that if any of your members are out in
Para, then they will see how to keep birds in an aviary in ideal
conditions, and the birds are unique. I should like also to add this,
that the Booth Line took infinite pains to look after these birds for
me, although I became very downhearted when they began to die for
some unforeseen reason although, as I have said before, I did manage to-
bring back a certain number, which have all done well in my aviary
this year.

that the little blue, red, and black birds so plentiful along the river
banks could not be kept alive for more than four days in captivity.
" It is painfully obvious," he continues, " that he must have been
relying entirely on hearsay, for it is well known that M. Brue brought
to Paris and had the honour of presenting to the King in September,
1726, some of each of these three species, the survivors of which were
.still alive in M. Daguesseau's charge in 1726. The banks of the river
swarm with these little birds, which in beak and head somewhat
resemble the Linnet, but the colour in each species is respectively
red, blue, or black, very bright and clear, so that the plumage looks
almost as if polished. The native children catch them with inverted
bowls or calabashes under which a few grains of millet are scattered
as bait and to which a supporting stick and pull-string is attached,
so that it can be dropped on any birds venturing below. The loss of
liberty does not upset these little things in the least--they seem, like
the negroes, to be born for slavery, and they feed readily in a cage,
coming up to whoever supplies their needs and repaying the attention
with a little song or twitter, feeble but sweet, which is all one can expect
from birds no bigger than a nut."
These three birds are the Cordon Bleu, Firefinch, and Combasou,
still the commonest cage-birds from West Africa. Presumably the
author never saw hens of either the Combasou or Firefinch, as probably
then as now the catchers only troubled to catch (or at any rate keep)
the bright-coloured individuals. E. Hopkinson.

These lovely little Grass Finches, which seem to increase in beauty
the closer one views them, are denizens of the warmer parts of Australia,
the White-rumped form, S. bichenovi, occurring in the north-eastern
and the Black-jumped, S. b. annulosa , in the north-western portions
of that continent ; and it is curious that these two races differ in
precisely the same way as do the two races of the Parson Finch figured
in our last number. The two forms have been imported from time
to time, but they have to be regarded as frail mites which need careful
protection from the inhospitable climate of this country.
In the wild state Bichenos occur in pairs or flocks, feeding upon
the seeds of grasses. The nest is a bottle-shaped structure, composed
of grass and lined with feathers or vegetable down and is placed in
a low bush or in long grass.
In captivity both species have bred in this country though only
on a few occasions. An interesting account of the breeding of the
Ringed Finch by Mrs. Howard Williams was published in this Magazine
in September, 1902, and as a good many of our members do not possess
the early volumes I may be permitted to quote freely from this. A
pair of these birds, obtained in January, were placed in an aviary

a conservatory. They took their share of the various foods, Indian
spray and white millet, ants' eggs, preserved egg, canary seed and,
most important, chickweed, which their owner grew specially for her
birds in a frame during the winter and which she found less coarse
and rank than that grown in the open. Flowering grass was supplied
when available, also soaked canary and millet.
" We did not pay any very special attention to them for some time,
being much interested in some Long-tails and Gouldians which were all
nesting, but at last I noticed that a hen Ringed Finch was sitting in a
very old rush basket with a hole in the back, which was hanging on
the wire front of the aviary, about the level of my eye. I could plainly
see the hen sitting through this hole, but foreign birds being shy we
scarcely looked at her at all lest she should desert."
On 29th May the young left the nest. " There were three of them,
one rather larger than the others. In appearance they were very much
like their parents but much lighter, especially the wings and tail,
and the dark shading at the top of the beak was hardly noticeable.
In one important point, however, they were entirely different. Seen
full face they were absolutely ringless, and their breasts were pure
white. In profile, they showed the beginning of the upper ring which
encircled the face. In a few days there was a faint indication of the
lower ring in the two smaller ones, but the eldest kept his pure white
breast some time longer. They were very small, but scrambled about
vigorously, and managed to get back to their nest whenever they were
tired and always at night.
"It is interesting to notice the difference between these and the
ordinary Bicheno's Finch, which has bred with us several times.
We think they leave the nest about the same time, at three weeks old,
but whereas the Ringed Finch emerges ringless, his relative has both
rings quite as clearly marked on leaving the nest as the Ringed Finches
have now at nine weeks old."
Whether the difference noted by Mrs. Williams would be found
to be constant could only be proved by further breeding experiments.
It would be strange if the two were to differ thus, seeing that they
are nothing more than local races of the same species.

By P. B. Webb
Perhaps some members may find parts of the following of interest
should they ever be fortunate enough to possess a pair of Parrot Finches
of either of the above kinds.
Before I go further I think something should be said about the
temperament of both species. This seems necessary as, about two
years ago, I recommended my friend Mr. P. W. Teague (of Gouldian
fame) to try a pair of these birds. Shortly after he managed to get
a true pair of Blue-headed which he successfully bred. I was surprised
a little time ago to see his advertisement in our Magazine for both the
old pair and their young. The following day I had a letter from him
saying that he had lost interest in them as they were so wild and that
he feared it was their nature because, try as he would, he could not
gain the confidence of either the old pair or the young.
Well, it is perfectly true that both these kinds of Parrot Finches
are very energetic indeed, and are inclined to be shy--particularly
the Blue-headed--but they are not, to my mind, wild--just " fidgety
Phils ". Compared with the stolid Gouldian, or even the Pintail
Nonpareil (which is a near relation), they are as the active fox terrier
to the placid bulldog. Possibly Mr. Teague has made this mistake,
but he has had a far greater experience of birds than I have and I think
it more likely that he has been unlucky in getting a " strain " with
wild and nervous dispositions.
The word " strain " may seem a curious one to use here, as a species
of bird or beast usually has the same temperament stamped hard
and fast in each individual, but this is only so provided they have
not been interfered with by mankind.
So far as I can find out the Blue-head is a bird which is practically
never imported, and yet it is more common than the Red-headed,
which is imported in small numbers very occasionally. The only
possible reason for this is that it is more frequently bred in captivity.

Therefore, it is not unreasonable to say that there are different
" strains " some of which are wild and some confiding. This is, I think,
proved by Mr. Teague's experience and mine, which is that I have had
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998486878787879" page_id="56222174"  page_num="300" year="" vol="">
Blue-heads which would eat mealworms from my fingers. I spent no
time in achieving this; it was discovered by accident and was then
cultivated. I hope I have not dwelt too long on this point, but it may
be the means of encouraging some who have had the same experience
as Mr. Teague, to have another try which may lead to much more
successful results.
There is not so much to say about the Bed-headed birds. I have
never heard anyone make any complaint about their characters,
but to those who are fond of a bird which sits still and is therefore
easily studied closely, I say " Beware ! " The bird which at some time
has gained for itself (I cannot think why) the name of " Common "
Parrot Finch, is not the one for them. It is the most sprightly, vivacious
little bundle of feathers that it is possible to imagine. It is never still
for a single minute, and as twilight falls it is the last to settle down
in the whole aviary. Though I do not often see the sun rise myself, I
feel sure that this Parrot Finch invariably does. There is, however,
one great drawback which confronts those who wish to breed them,
and that is the great scarcity of hens. The reason for this must be
that the hens escape the catchers for some reason ; either they are more
wary or the birds are caught during the breeding season when hens are
sitting--probably the latter. It is not that the hens are more delicate
or are very subject to egg-binding, which is the curse of Grass Finches
in general. My experience has been that the cocks are not so tough
as the hens, and I have never yet had a hen egg-bound. I have usually
managed to get my birds to nest in their shed, which helps, and usually
Grass Finches insist on nesting in a bush out in the flight where it is
cooler.
I think that on the whole most people will agree with me that
the Bed-head is the better bird of the two, though both are well worth
having and are easy to keep, but neither should be allowed out during
the winter months--in the north of Ireland at any rate.
When I take a fancy to a bird I have not kept before, the first thing
I try to find out is, " How have these birds been successfully fed in

captivity in the past ? " and I look through my books and back numbers
of the Avicultukal Magazine in the hope of getting this information.
I have found that people who write books and articles very often seem
to forget that really what one wants to know most, and certainly first,
is what they have found the best way of feeding the particular bird.
I, therefore, not wishing to make this mistake, will tell you--not
necessarily the best way to feed the Parrot Finches--but the way I
have found best up to the present. I should say, before I start, I am
still trying new ideas in feeding and that now and again something
is altered, but that which follows is as far as I have reached. All the
remarks I shall make in this article apply equally to either species
unless otherwise stated.
Assuming that we have just received some newly imported specimens
and that they are somewhat frail, and though healthy enough are--as
is usual--very thin. At this time it will be found best to cage each
one in a cage to itself in a warm room. It is important that the room
should be of course at as even a temperature as possible, say about
60* F. It will probably be found that they will refuse to eat white
millet. This used to worry me a good bit at first, as it cut down the
variety of the menu one could offer. However, if they don't eat it,
always remember that it has not a very high feeding value--at least,
so I understand from a book of tables which I possess. They will,
however, eat plenty of canary seed and this should always be before
them unmixed with any other seeds. In another pot give canary seed
to which has been added one teaspoonful to the pint of cod-liver oil.
They will usually eat this without any trouble ; if they do not, the
ordinary canary seed may be removed every fourth or fifth day and
it will not be long before they learn that it is not so bad after all and
will eat it with or without oil equally well.
Mealworms are greatly appreciated. I have often seen in print
that one must be careful with these insects. We are told that they are
fattening and that, useful as they are, must not be supplied to provide
a stimulating food. Well, that is probably correct, but the point as
I see it is this--the birds like them better than anything you can give
them and for that reason alone I think they must be beneficial, even
if you have to counteract their fattening effect.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.978791243243243" page_id="56222176"  page_num="302" year="" vol="">
302 P. B. Webb--Common or Bed-headed , and Tri-coloured
I see in my tables (which I hope are correct) that millet and oats
are among the least fattening of seeds. It therefore seems that
millet, or even oats, is what is wanted to balance things up. Well,
oats are on the large side for Bed-heads, though if they are not old and
dry they will eat a little. As they don't like white millet this looks
like being a problem. We have one other thing to fall back on, though
it is rather an expensive luxury for most birds--except as a tit-bit.
A Parrot Finch is not a glutton and you will find from their point of
view, after mealworms, comes sprays of millet. This is really very
obliging of them. Is it not rather strange, however, in view of the fact
that if you offer ordinary Indian millet---which is, I believe, the same
thing removed from the ear--they will probably eat none of it at all ?
It may be that sprays are gathered before they are ripe and the other
is not. Or, perhaps, it is the novelty of hunting for their own food
in a more natural way. I cannot say. At all events it will be found
that about three to four mealworms per bird per day, and sprays ad lib.,
give satisfactory results. It is best to soak the sprays for three or
four days and rinse well before using.
This opens up another avenue of thought. If it were possible to
procure such seeds as canary, white, and other millets in the ear, would
our birds benefit by it % I am thinking more from a psychological
effect on the bird's mind than from the feeding value point of view,
as this seems to be all there is to it.
Now I am not in favour of handling birds much. It is obvious that
they don't like it and there is always the danger of hurting them.
At the end of, say, the third week, however, it would be well to have
a look at their breast bones individually, to make sure that they are
not getting too fat. If so, cut out the cod-liver oil and reduce the
mealworms by half. In any case they will probably be better
without the former for a few weeks, as it can be overdone, and
sometimes a bird will eat too much of it, upsetting its inside. The
symptoms are usually that they get sluggish and lazy, meaning by that,
they become more like other birds with regard to activity. This must
on no account be allowed.
There are two other things which should be given, but in each
case sparingly--about a teaspoonful on alternate days to each pair

(a) soaked seeds, and (6) a good insectile mixture. For soaked seeds
canary and white and Indian millet may be used--they should be
just sprouting. Boiling the seed is probably worse than useless. The
birds usually eat these seeds right off, but a little honey on top may help
matters, especially if a little of the latter is smeared on a mealworm
which is put on top of the seed the first time or so. For insectile
mixture I prefer the "' ready to use " kinds that require no water--
there are several on the market ; Mr. E. B. Tanner, a keeper in the
London Zoo, prepares at his home the one used here. Probably you
will find they leave the ants' eggs, but they are very fond of the rest
of it, which looks like sponge-cake damped somehow. Some other
birds will eat the ants' eggs left over, a Pekin Robin or a Shama for
instance, but there won't be much anyhow.
As time goes on and the birds improve in condition and feather,
they may be put together in a flight cage which should be as large
as possible. It is not usual for Parrot Finches caged together to give
trouble by picking each other's feathers or fighting. Unfortunately,
pairs of these birds do not display affection towards each other as most
birds do, so this will not be a means of finding out the sexes. The
sexing of these birds is, incidentally, about the most difficult job the
owner will have--but more about this later on.
About the middle of May I usually turn the birds out--this depends
more on the weather than anything else. There is no use putting them
out too soon in their summer quarters because, though our summer is
not a long one, there is plenty of time for two families of youngsters
to be reared. Even if the spring is an early one and the summer lasts
well into September it would not be advisable to let them have a third
round. There are people who think differently and say that three
families are all right, but it is better in the long run not to be greedy.
As soon as the birds are turned out place the following foods before
them daily : plain canary seed ; cod-liver oil-soaked canary seed (one
teaspoonful to the pint as usual) ; millet sprays ; insectile mixture,
soaked seeds, and mealworms, the last three named in the quantities
before mentioned. This may be continued until the nest has been
built, the eggs laid, and the hen starts sitting. It is then well to cut
out the insectile mixture and reduce the mealworms to about half.

The day the young birds are due to arrive these should be again supplied
as usual, then increased gradually until the young birds are each getting
the same share as their parents when about nineteen days old. They
leave the nest at the age of eighteen to twenty days.
It is as well to look into the nest about the third day to see how
many young birds there are (if any). Parrot Finches do not mind their
nests being looked at provided it is done by the right person, in the
right way, and of course not too often. It is, however, safer to do it
when the parents are in the flight--" What the eye does not see, etc."
I once made the mistake of closing the entrance to the flight while
I had a peep. It was not till about two hours later that I remembered
to open it, and of course the result of the mistake was fatal. Here is
a better idea : instead of closing the door put your handkerchief in
the hole. If you forget to remove it you will miss your handkerchief
in a very short time--at any rate I do !
Young Parrot Finches soon learn to eat Millet Sprays, and it will be
found that a pair of old birds and four youngsters will get through
almost a whole spray in a day ; certainly four sprays will not last more
than five days.
It should not be found necessary to remove the young Parrot
Finches from their parents, at least until their younger brothers and
sisters are hatched. Even then I don't think it would matter much,
as they don't give the least trouble, neither do the old birds do them
any injury as some birds--such as Cuba Finches--would.
They are about the most peaceable family that one could imagine.
Several families will live together in perfect harmony. In fact I have
had a pair and three odd cocks in one aviary who have had two families
without the least bit of squabbling. The three odd cocks did not worry
the paired hen, but neither (so far as I know) did they give any
help with the rearing of the family. These birds were Red-heads.
A similar success, but not so marked, has been obtained with a pair
of Blue-heads and two odd cocks. In this case two young were hatched
and reared in the first nest, but the hen deserted the second nest the day
before her four fertile eggs were due to hatch. This was due, how-
ever, to the birds being frightened too late in the evening for the hen
to find her way back to the nest.

There is one thing which must be very carefully avoided. Do not
have any other birds in the aviary other than Parrot Finches, the
reason being that they will let even Waxbills rob their nests of material
or turn them out altogether. They will spend the year building nests
for other birds to live in without laying a single egg. This applies to
the Blue-heads, and the Bed is no better when it comes to fighting
for house and home. It would not even be advisable to have Bed-heads
in the same aviary as Blue-heads for this reason.
Parrot Finches are hardy if kept indoors in winter and the tem-
perature not allowed to fall below about 45* to 50* F. But (yes, there
is a catch in it, though one which has a remedy) there is a curious
ailment with which Bed-heads are affected. I lost two with a wasting
disease before saving the third and the fourth. If one of your birds
gets this trouble you will find him spending most of his time at the
feeder. It will probably still be fairly active, but his wings will usually
not be carried as high as is natural. They will be held with the flight
feather lower than the tail root, as with the British Bobin, and there
will be a thick appearance, which gradually gets worse. It will also
be noticed that the bird eats little though he is continually working
seeds in his beak, shelling some and discarding most. As the disease
takes its course the bird will be seen continually stretching his neck
and yawning--just like a chicken with gapes. The first bird that
took it with me I thought it had some form of gapes, but when the bird
eventually died there was nothing of the kind to be found. The only
apparent cause of death was that the bird had no food in it and was
in a very emaciated condition. The same was the report on No. 2.
These two birds had been given all the remedies for the usual bird
disorders without success. When the third bird went the same way I
therefore thought of trying something in the line of a building-up
tonic, so deciding to start with cod-liver oil, I mixed a quantity of
canary seed with it in the proportion of four teaspoonfuls to a pint.
You will say, probably, " That should finish it off fairly soon," but
remember that the birds were found when opened to have no food in
them ; it was therefore probable that in the earlier stages they only
ate very little. I was counting on the oil they licked off the seeds more
than that which was actually absorbed by it.

The second day of this treatment there was a very marked improve-
ment in the bird, and there was little or no gaping. The cod-liver
oil seed which had not been used was then mixed with equal parts of
ordinary canary seed, and at the end of a week he was well on the
road to complete recovery.
The fourth bird was cured with equal success. I have not discovered
what this disease is, or what it is caused by, but until we find this out
we have a simple cure. Prevention is better than cure, however, so
there is room for research in this direction. If anyone can let us know
something about what it is, or the cause of it, they will be adding
to the comfort of these little birds.
After saying so much about this ailment you may think these
birds are not at all hardy. When I tell you that three of the four birds
were newly imported (and in the month of February at that)--two of
these having only about half their full complement of feathers, while
the fourth bird was about a year in this country and had never been
strong--it does not sound so bad.
It should be mentioned that this disease has only been experienced
with the Red-heads. I have only once seen a dead Blue-head and
that was a young bird which was drowned. I do not remember ever
giving any sort of medicine to one of this latter variety; they are as
hard as nails.
The most troublesome thing about Parrot Finches is the unfortunate
similarity of the sexes. A good deal has been written about this point
in the past, but I have found very little of it of any real practical use.
Those who have said " the sexes are alike in plumage 55 are probably
nearest the truth. By accident last year I struck what I believe
to be a fairly certain test for the sex of Red-heads. Not wishing,
however, to confuse further--should it ultimately prove wrong--I do
not intend to say what it is, just yet. It is very simple and therefore
I fear someone would surely have noticed it before if there was anything
in it. It was, nevertheless, correct in the case of nine birds in my
aviary this spring. When the 1932 youngsters get their adult plumage
and then prove it correct by laying eggs, or not--as the case may
be--or should they die they can be dissected; then is the time to tell it.
During the winter while the birds are confined to the house the

feeding has to be more simple as it would take a great deal of time
doing the daily round. There is always a hopper filled with canary
seed, one with white millet and another with Indian. The birds
hardly touch either of the latter, but if they eat any at all it is always
well, as it is difficult to vary the food of these birds much. About
three times a week sprays are provided, and about twice a week
insectile mixture and two mealworms per bird. The last two things
are given on different days, so the bill of fare is not too monotonous.
Every six weeks or so cod-liver oil-soaked canary seed is given
for a week. Tufts of weed grass are put in regularly--earth and all.
These rules are not held to hard and fast, and should the birds be
moulting, for instance, more insectile food is used and also cod-liver
oil seed.
It is usual to separate the sexes as far as is possible. It is best to
have the cocks as far away as is convenient. If you have two houses
put the cocks in one and the hens in the other. This reduces the
chances of the cocks bickering and of hens doing any winter laying.
Neither is likely, but it is well to take as few risks as you can.
Parrot Finches are very fond of bathing, so do not use dishes with
more than an inch or so of water in them, and change daily.
In the spring of 1931, thinking I would be very kind to my Parrot
Finches when they were turned into their outdoor aviary, I kept the
heater on. The head feathers of the birds were continually in quills.
After a month or so the weather became warmer and so the heater was
turned off. The birds almost at once got their full plumage and began
to think of nesting. To make quite sure that it was the heating it was
again turned on and the result was more quills which disappeared
when it was stopped. Members have from time to time written to the
Magazine about birds in aviaries with heated shelters. It certainly
has not been a success with Parrot Finches here, though it may suit
birds of the Parrot tribe.
For nesting sites the best things to use are straw hats, wicker cages,
and the usual Finch boxes. The birds seem to like them in the order
mentioned. Almost any material will be used for building, but moss,
fine hay, heads of flowering grasses, and dry leaves are most often
used. They have not a craving for nesting in the flight, and as this is

not to be encouraged these hats, etc., should be placed only in the shed.
The grass in the flight should be kept fairly short as on two occasions
birds have built nests here on the ground in long grass. They were
not a success in either case.
When the young birds leave the nest it is much better that they
should remain in the shed for a day or two, no matter how good the
weather. If they leave a nest in the flight and are then put into the
shed they seem to be out again like " Jack-in-the-boxes ". If, however,
they are hatched in the shed there is usually not much trouble keeping
them there if the hole is a small one. When they do find their way
out it is well to have a look before dusk to make sure that they have
found their way in again. There won't be much trouble after, say,
the third night. If you can procure a few sheaves of new crop oats
as soon as it is ripe, or a little before, the birds are quite fond of it.
I have told you my interpretation of the experiments which I
have carried out during 1932. It may be interesting for any who have
read thus far to see just how the three different pairs were actually
fed. The table on p. 309 will, therefore, meet the case.
Some may say that the results are not very conclusive : that
although No. 3 pair succeeded in rearing four birds they had more
fertile eggs, and only reared 50 per cent of them. Also that the four
in the first nest might not have been reared had they not been drowned
by rain. To the latter I can say nothing ; to the first I say that they
had 100 per cent fertile eggs and 100 per cent hatch, and this alone
must not be forgotten. A glance at No. 1 and 2 pairs will show that
they did not have so good a percentage of fertile, and of the fertile
there was not a full hatch. In the case of No. 1 pair (which was a proved
pair in 1931, laying seven eggs, six of which were fertile) the fertility
was 75 per cent, while of these only 66S per cent hatched ; while with
No. 2 pair it was only 27J per cent fertile and less than 10 per cent
hatched. It should be mentioned that No. 1 pair in 1931 was treated
in almost the same w T ay as No. 3 pair this year, the only difference
being that they got hardly as many millet sprays.
If you take the Blue-heads into consideration there were two nests of
four each, only one of which was clear, 87J per cent fertile. You will
remember the second nest was deserted the evening before the hatch,

attention should be drawn to another point. It is this : although in

being taken, the story is ratker a different one as autumn and winter
approach. If the weather becomes suddenly cold and perhaps damp
about mid-September (as is usual in this country) and the birds have
not already been closed in their indoor aviary, one will make arrange-
ments quickly to put them at once into their winter quarters. This
will be found to have a bad effect on the birds 5 health. They will get
a set-back and will perhaps go into an unnatural moult. Worse still,
they may even die from this cause alone. It is much wiser to start
early by keeping the birds indoors at first one day a week, increasing it
to two or three days a week. Then when the weather breaks the effect
will not be felt. Especially will this be so if you can manage to let
them out for an hour during sunny intervals occasionally. Care,
however, should be taken with this and the good will be lost if it is
overdone. I make this suggestion in connection with Parrot Finches,
but it was actually with Zebra Finches that the value of the procedure
was first realized here. Probably it is equally true with all birds that
are confined during the winter months. It may at first seem of little
importance, but when one thinks of all the little things that a bird
is continually getting on the ground and in bushes it will be realized
that a sudden deprivation of these things will be missed. Certainly
better results have been obtained since it was put into force in my
aviaries, and it is strongly recommended.

The Turnix belong to one of those genera of birds in which the
cock alone incubates and takes charge of the young, yet this year
I have had a hen Turnix taigoor which laid four eggs and then proceeded
to incubate them herself. The little cock sat close up to her and was
only allowed on the eggs when she went off to feed, if he did not
accompany her. There was no doubt as to which bird was really
on the eggs as the nest was close to the wire netting, the other side of
which was the door into the food room. Sometimes when she came off

she used to " boom ", a call which I have only heard just before and
during the laying of a clutch of eggs, which out of some hundred clutches
laid in my aviaries by various hens, is nearly always three.
As they had not hatched after eighteen days I took them away and
found them all infertile. Thinking that there might be something
wrong with this abnormal hen, I took her out and gave the cock one
of my other two hens.
A few days afterwards I was able to buy another cock but of a
different species to my first one. This I put in with the first hen.
They soon paired up and the hen laid four eggs again ; owing to the
cock being new to the place and the want of cover they always left the
eggs whenever I came within a few yards of the aviary. From a distance
the cock appeared to be standing in front of them, rather than
incubating them.
Three of the eggs had hatched out by the morning of 3rd September.
The hen took no further interest in them and as live food was rather
scarce I took her away. Now, 20th October, these three chicks are
about the size of the cock and look very like him.
The hen with the original cock did not lay until all hope of getting
live food for the chicks was over. As two of these eggs were fertile
it was a great pity, for now I believe this cock is some other species,
as his legs are yellow while those of the three hens and the new cock
are a lead colour ; the rest of his plumage is much like the hen's, except
that they have a black stripe down the breast. As the cock and hen
were sent to me together as a pair I never doubted them until I got the
new cock a few months ago. Now I believe that this cock is tanlci ,
of which I have only had odd hens, and the new cock is taigoor. I
thought at first that it was some other species and was surprised at
the eggs hatching.

In previous articles I have given an account of some of the out-
standing successes of the season and also of the principal failures and
disappointments. To the latter must be added the death, two days
after being taken from the nest, of a young Amboina King Parrakeet.
The male parent, Alisterus amboinensis huruensis , much smaller than
the hen, though similarly coloured, reached me in very bad condition
from long and close confinement, and it is probably owing to some
lingering defect in his constitution that his offspring failed to reach
maturity. Two eggs were laid by the hen--a typical amboinensis --in
a natural tree-trunk, but only one hatched and the young bird was
deformed, lacking the last joint to one wing, which resulted in its being
naturally pinioned. It stayed in the nest far beyond the normal
period and when taken out was found to be rickety. Although both
parents were assiduous in caring for it and had begun to moult, just
before we opened the nest the hen had delivered a violent attack on
her mate, scalping him badly and nearly killing him. Her conduct
was wholly unexpected as they had lived together for nearly two years
without any hint of serious trouble. I can only suppose that she had
got nervy and irritable over the strange delay on the part of her child
in leaving the nursery, and some tactless remark from the cock to the
effect that it was probably her fault precipitated an explosion ! The
young bird was fully feathered and save that it had less blue on the
mantle was as brightly coloured as the adults. A. amboinensis is
evidently one of the most modern and highly specialized of the King
Parrakeets as male, female, and young are much alike and are all
richly coloured.
Although, as usual, disappointments were frequent among the
greatest treasures, the commoner birds and established breeding pairs
acquitted themselves remarkably well. A pair of Barrabands that
reared three young last season this year brought up five. The cock was
bred by Madame Lecallier and as a youngster distinguished himself
by finding his way home across the Solent after he had been blown from
Havant to the Isle of Wight in a furious blizzard. His wife appears

to have artistic tastes as she persistently refused to nest until her box
was decorated inside and out with natural bark ! A second pair of
Barrabands which reared three young are interesting in that their
offspring are third generation aviary-bred and are from parents that
are brother and sister into the bargain. The parents were bred by
Mr. Ezra from a pair bred by myself. Birds of the same species--
especially intelligent ones like Parrakeets--show interesting and
(sometimes !) delightful variations in individual temperament. The
mother of the three young birds stands out among all the Barraband
hens I have owned for her extreme enthusiasm for the joys and cares
of domestic life. She had nested with a previous owner but her eggs
had been infertile and an exchange for an unrelated bird had been
arranged. The day after her arrival she showed no uneasiness at her
strange surroundings nor regret for her former mate, but climbed
about in a great state of excitement answering the calls of the gentleman
she had decided on as his successor. The favoured cock had been
living for a considerable time with another lady, though in justice to
him and the very high standard of morality characteristic of Barrabands,
I cannot say that he had actually made proposals of marriage. Any-
how, as soon as he discovered the new hen's aviary (he was a partly
trained liberty bird), he had eyes for nothing but her. They fell
violently in love at first sight and have been devoted to each other
ever since. Directly the nest-box was put in they took possession
of it and for nearly nine weeks I saw so little of the hen that I often
feared she might be dead. I have never had a Barraband who took
to her nest so quickly or stayed so constantly with her family until
they were almost ready to fly.
Two pairs of Indian Ringnecks living in the same large aviary
went to nest about the same time. One pair reared five strong
young ones but only a solitary youngster emerged from the second
nest, to be fatally injured soon after by the parents of the five.
Later we found the mummied corpse of the second hen inside her
box. The tragedy shows that even ring-necks cannot safely be kept
together in the breeding season, even though they are said often to nest
in colonies in India. A pair of Rosellas had six young in their first
nest. One young bird was rickety and injured itself and had to be

destroyed, but the rest were very fine specimens. The cock of this
pair, though a ferocious fighter with other birds of his sex and
genus, is a singularly gentle and devoted husband and father.
He was at one time a liberty bird, but so great was his attachment
to his mate that he insisted on roosting on the roof of her aviary,
with the result that one night he was badly mauled by a rat. Since
then I have kept him shut up all the year round, an arrangement which
he evidently prefers.
The Yellow-rumps reared five fine young ones in their first brood
and four in their second. They are also a model couple, very gentle
and devoted to each other and extremely prolific. Although, through
no fault of their own, they have not reared all their offspring, they must,
since I first had them, have hatched nearly sixty eggs. Like many
good breeding pairs they were, for many years, abnormally wild and
nervous. It has also taken them nearly nine seasons to acquire a
taste for peanuts !
The Crimson-wings reared three good young ones, the fourth egg
of the hen's first clutch being misshapen. For the first time in her
life she laid two more eggs after rearing her first brood, but she did
not sit.
The Australian Kings hatched two eggs of their first clutch and
reared a very fine true pair of young ones which promise to be better
birds than their parents. The hen laid again and has a second
brood a few weeks old. Strange to say, the cock seems more
fertile late in the summer when he has begun to moult than earlier
in the year. I find it is quite easy to sex Kings within a few weeks
of their leaving the nest. The hens have much darker beaks and the
red on the abdomen does not extend so high up. A young cock's
beak becomes partly reddish at an early age.
Brown&apos;s Parrakeets reared four good young late in the summer after
a spring moult. Last year they lost their young in a similar type of
nest. The hen is aviary-bred but her husband is imported and has
a none too creditable " past " both in his native land and in England.
Though a model father, he possesses the unpleasant peculiarity of
desiring to murder his wife if for any reason he has been separated from
her even for the briefest period, while his appetite for warfare and

bloodshed is something incredible S In Australia he murdered the
greater part of an aviary of birds, while he and his principal rivals
bear to this day the scars of the three days' battle which raged almost
unceasingly when some years ago I was imprudent enough to try him
at liberty ! I should perhaps add that these shortcomings are peculiar
to himself. The average cock Brown's is no more and no less pugnacious
than any other broadtail.
A pair of lutinistic Plumheads were given a hollow apple-tree for
a nest. Last year, in a grandfather-clock box, three out of their four
young were badly rickety. The hen bit a hole in the top of the tree-
trunk in addition to the entrance-hole at the side, but as I thought
she might consider the extra light and air preventative of rickets I did
not interfere with her arrangements. Apparently she was right, as
the four green young proved nice strong birds. They were reared
largely on spray millet of which the parents are exceedingly fond,
in addition, of course, to fruit and other seeds. Young Plumheads
are decidedly sensitive to cold and must be wintered indoors their first
season. They undergo a fairly thorough body moult their first autumn,
when their heads become grey, being green tinged with dull salmon
pink when they are in first plumage. I am still uncertain as to whether
the males assume their plum-coloured heads in the second or third
autumn.
My Barnardius crommelince which, for a long time, I believed to be
a hen, has ultimately turned out a male. His mate, an ordinary
Barnard, did not nest last year, but this season they reared four young,
one being weakly and dying after being caught up. The cocks have
well-developed yellow bars on the breast but the hens had the uniform
blue-green of the male parent.
Pennants hatched two of their seven eggs and reared two nice
young, one being mainly red in first plumage and the other mainly
green. The cock is a bit eccentric as a result of many years close
confinement in a cage in a grimy industrial town. He is now, in his
old age, a thoroughly lazy rascal, leaving the whole care of his family to
his wife whom he does not bother to feed even when she is sitting. If
he sees her busy about the home he whistles pompously by way of
encouragement but does nothing else. I do not think she has any

illusions about him, particularly since last winter when he was at
liberty and not only flirted outrageously with a hen Stanley less than
half his size but tactlessly brought her on to the roof of his wife's aviary
to the intense annoyance of that ill-used lady ! His taste for low
company also attracts him to the Queen of Bavaria Conures, whose
clownish antics and deafening voices fill every broadtail of refined
disposition with wonder and disgust. The season's successes and
failures have tended to emphasize the value of natural tree-trunks
as compared with artificial nest-boxes and indicate that the prevalence
or absence of rickets in young birds depends quite as much on the season
as on the feeding. Last year, using cod-liver oil-soaked seed I had
about eighteen bad cases of rickets, three mild ones, and about half
a dozen young birds dying in the nest out of a total of about forty
hatched. This year, without cod-liver oil, I have only had two cases
of rickets, one weakly youngster and seven dying in the nest out of
a total of about sixty-two hatched.
In November the Hooded Parrakeets hatched two young on the
floor of the aviary shelter, but they only lived three days in spite of
artificial heat.

One of my disappointments this year is that a pair of Hooded
Siskins hatched out at their second attempt but failed to rear the young.
Soon after they were let out of their winter quarters they took
a fancy to a Hartz cage hung up in the shelter. Two eggs were laid
and then they seemed to lose all interest in the nest, but when going
to get the eggs to give to a Canary I found them quite warm. I
discovered that one of several hen Sporophilce was incubating them.
As I still put the food dishes in the shelter the birds had to come in to
feed. The Hooded Siskins used, after feeding, to fly up on to this
cage and prevent the hen Sporophila from entering it. Matters were
further complicated by a pair of Black-headed Siskins which had a nest
on the opposite wall. The cock used to feed the hen on the nest and

then drive out the Hooded Siskins and any of the Sporophilce that
happened to be there. He took no notice of the Grass Finches what-
ever. The eggs were deserted and when I broke them open I found
them nearly ready to hatch.
After the other Siskins had reared a brood, although the hen was
sitting again, I took out the cock to give the Hooded a chance.
Not very long afterwards the same Sporophila hen, or another one,
built a nest in a privet bush ; when finished the Hooded Siskins seized
it and laid four or five eggs. I hardly liked to examine it but I noticed
one day that some of the eggs had hatched, then on two occasions
I had to go in and rescue some Quail chicks and catch up the parents
as well. This probably disturbed the Siskins too much as shortly
after their nest was empty. Last year they only made feeble attempts
at nest building when in a small flight all to themselves. I put it down
to the cold and wet summer, but it seems as if this hen cannot build
her own nest. The eggs laid in the first nest were like the later ones,
quite different from those of the White-throated Finch, the only
Sporophila eggs that I have seen.

captivity. M. Delacour brought over some a few years ago from
Chapa, in the north of Tonkin, close to the borders of Yunnan, and very
kindly gave me some. These were turned out into a large aviary,
and although they laid several times last year no chicks were reared.
This spring the first lot of four eggs were laid early in May, in a nest
which was just a hole at the foot of some pampas grass. Two young
were hatched out, and the other two eggs contained dead chicks. These
chicks disappeared soon after hatching. Four more eggs were laid
on the 4th June, the birds using the same nest. Three of these hatched
out, and the fourth egg contained a dead chick. My success in rearing
these was due to my man, Shearing, who promptly removed the hen
bird with her three chicks into a small aviary which they had to them-
selves. Two of the three chicks were successfully reared by the hen
bird in the small aviary. The chicks were fed on fresh ants' eggs,
gentles, and yolk of egg to start with, and later they- ate everything.
The first lot of chicks were evidently devoured by the Ground Cuckoos
which occupied the same aviary. Another nest was found in some
thick grass, and this also contained four eggs. All were hatched out
and were taken with the hen into a small aviary. None were reared
as the hen bird was much too wild. In each clutch there were four
eggs, and the period of incubation was roughly between eighteen and
twenty days. I am pleased to have succeeded in rearing these rare

The White-winged Mynah is found from Burmah to Indo-China.
It lives in wooded districts and among isolated trees in park-like
country, but not in primeval forest. They nest in holes of trees, and
are usually seen in flocks of twenty to thirty. They are not migratory,
but wander from place to place. One often sees them feeding on
nectar and insects, on flowering trees such as the silk-cotton ( Bombax).

M. Delacour caught a few of these pretty birds in the suburbs of Saigon,
and very kindly gave me a pair. These nested in a log nest-box, and
the nest was constructed with old leaves, dried grass, and sticks.
The colour of the egg is light blue. Two young were hatched about
the 21st May. Both were found dead. One when only six days old,
but the other, which was fully feathered, about a fortnight old. They
laid one egg on the 8th June, and a young one was hatched on the 22nd.
This one was well looked after by both the parents, and left the nest
on the 14th July, fully reared. I believe this is the first time this bird
has been bred in captivity. I may mention that this Mynah does
very well in aviaries and is quite easy to keep and to feed.

" our esteemed member, Mr. Busb, informs me that this
species ( chalybeus ) has bred freely in his aviary and that he
was surprised to find the nestling plumage glossy. . . . We
hope to give a detailed account ... in our next." No such
account appeared, so we get no further. In any case it
must always be doubtful exactly what " Green Glossy
Starling " indicates, there are so many alike, and although
where a specific name is given in a record it is usually
chalybeus (East Africa), we may presume that much the
most likely species (at any rate till recently) to have been
bred is the West African chloropterus.

[M. Decoux has been good enough to send me some corrections

part of Additions to Breeding Records, which appeared in the July
number, p. 149.
These are : (1) The date of Passereaux (there should be no article
Les) is before 1894, which is the date of a second edition. (2) For
U Aviculteur . . . read UAviculture . . . This is a reprint of articles which
appeared 1891 to 1893 in the Bulletin de la Societe d'Acclimatation de
France. (3) Insectivores . . . was published in 1898. (4) As important
as any, the correct spelling of my kindly corrector's name is Decoux
without an accent.

We have received from the author, Dr. Hans Steiner, a copy of his
V ererbungsstudien am Wellensittich (1932). This is a Thesis submitted
to the Philosophy Faculty of the Zurich University, and its title may
.be Englished as "A Study in Heredity in the Budgerigar", and its
secondary title as "A Critical Contribution to the problems of domestica-
tion ". It deals fully with the general history from the first living arrival
in Gould's time in 1840 up to the development of the latest colours and
breeding experiments to date, in fact with every detail and problem
connected with what can now be rightly described as the science of
Budgerigar breeding. It is to be hoped that some one competent will
come forward to translate this interesting and valuable treatise.
All that can be done here is to attempt to illustrate its scope by
translating the more important chapter headings.

skill from his long experience of keeping birds under ideal conditions.
Mr. Moody was quick to observe and to profit by his observations and,
moreover, he kept careful notes. The result is that he has been able
to hand on the results of his long years of practice in bird-keeping in
the form of a book that will be generally acknowledged as of great
value to all who will wish to keep these groups of birds. It is a book
of 240 pages, and in it the author tells of the appearance, habits,
disposition, nesting habits, and so forth of nearly two hundred different
species of birds that have at one time or another been in the Scampston
collection. It is valuable as a record of the large number of species
that that collection at one time contained, but its chief value lies in
the experience gained and recorded.
The last twenty pages or so deal with Aviaries, Foods and Feeding,
Overcrowding, Handling, Treatment of New Arrivals, Packing, Feather-
clipping and Pinioning, Vermin, Diseases and Accidents. It is a book
that will be invaluable to all who contemplate commencing bird-
keeping, and even the old hands will find much in it that is useful.
It contains some nice photographic plates.

We are all familiar with. Dr. Hopkinson's very valuable breeding
records. His book, Records of Birds Bred in Captivity (Witherby,
326 High. Holborn), has proved of great value to aviculturists, but as
this was published in 1926, many additional records have been made
since. These are being recorded in detail in the series of articles
appearing in our journal, but in addition to this the author has
published a Summary of Breeding Records to Date , which shows at a
glance those species that are known to have been bred, and, in different
type, the more doubtful records.
We note that in the case of the Grey-headed Sheldrake (Casarca
cana) the author has hybrid records only. This was bred in St. James's
Park in 1930, and by M. Delacour in France in 1932. The Glossy
Ibis was bred at the Zoological Gardens in 1895, and Peale's Parrot
Finch in 1912.
This useful pamphlet can be obtained from Dr. Hopkinson (Wynstay,
Balcombe, Sussex) if the price (2s. 6 d.) is enclosed and the word
Records added to the address on the envelope, to ensure attention.

BENGALESE HATCHING PARROT FINCH EGGS

Perhaps the following will interest our members.
I returned from a holiday on 11th July, just in time to see a Blue-
headed Parrot Finch hen die a few hours after my arrival. The following
*day I saw the cock Parrot Finch fly from a nest in an old hat each
time I passed the aviary, so I decided to examine the nest, where I
found four eggs. These I removed and kept in bran, turning them
daily, if I remembered, until I had a foster hen to sit them. Eleven
*days elapsed before a pair of Bengalese nested. These four eggs were
placed under the Bengalese when she had laid two eggs, afterwards
removing any further eggs laid by her. To my amazement one Parrot
Finch egg hatched out of the four on 4th August. This youngster left

the nest on 24th August, a fine healthy bird. This baby was peeking
and almost feeding itself the following day, and now it is a fine strong
bird.
The amazing part is that the germ in the egg from so small a bird
could retain its vitality and hatch after being kept so long, more
especially as the weather was very warm at this period. The first
point is, had these eggs been previously sat on, considering the cock
bird left the nest each time the aviary was passed, which goes to show
that incubation had probably commenced before the hen went sick,
and secondly the fifth egg was discovered upon removing the hat
later on, which is the complement of eggs that my Parrot Finches have
always laid. This would point to the fact that incubation had probably
commenced.
Motto : Don&apos;t always destroy eggs should an accident happen.

GAPES AND ITS TREATMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996471764705883" page_id="56222203"  page_num="329" year="" vol="">
I have been much interested to see the good results obtained by
Mr. Ezra in using " Kur-ide " as a cure for gapes in his Starlings. For
years I had the same trouble at Cleres, loosing practically all the young
Starlings of different species a few days after they left the nest, so
much so that I have long given up their breeding. Also adult Spreos
and Royal Starlings often succumbed to the disease.
This year we have been free from the kind of gape-worms that
affect game birds and passerine birds, but we had, as usual, some
cases of the Waterfowl gapes, which are caused by a different worm,
although nearly allied species, young Geese, Sheld-ducks, and Tree-
ducks being affected. We tried on them the treatment recommended
some years ago for small birds by Dr. C. Arnault in VOiseau , that is
to say that we injected into the wind-pipes of the birds a small quantity
of " Aniodol interne ", a strong disinfectant extracted from garlic,
which can be purchased from any French chemist's. For small birds,
a medical syringe with a special smooth-ended needle must be used,
and it is not at all easy to manage, but with Waterfowl and game

birds, even with young chicks, it is quite simple to use an ordinary
medical glass dropper, the end of which is introduced a few millimetres
deep into the windpipe. The opening of the windpipe, at the base
of the tongue, can easily be brought forward by means of a rubber
band or a small piece of smooth wire. According to the size of the
bird treated, from 6 to 20 drops are so sent down the windpipe.
We found that every time it saved the life of the bird, which,
after a few hours, seemed to have completely recovered. However,
one or two injections may be necessary, as the gape-worm eggs which
may exist in the system of the bird have perhaps evolved and penetrated
the windpipe again. This cure so far has proved quite effective, and
no accident whatever need be feared.

SOME BIRD NOTES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976569" page_id="56222204"  page_num="330" year="" vol="">
Ten years ago I bought a number of Grenadier Weaver birds from
the late Mr. J. D. Hamlyn. A short time after this purchase a rat
(or I think it must have been an old rat with young ones) got
into my aviary and killed twenty-three foreign birds, including
some of the Weavers ; another Weaver had one wing nearly torn off.
I very carefully cut the wing off, and it made a good recovery, came into
colour, and was a very tame bird. It has just died, having lived ten
years with only one wing. It came into full colour each spring.
I sent two of these Weavers to a friend, and these were still living,
in full colour, a short time since.
Two Parrots came into my possession some years ago, in rather a
strange way. I received a letter from a girls' orphanage in south
London, saying that a Parrot had flown into one of their open
windows, and asking if I had lost one or knew of anyone who had.
I called and saw a very fine Blue-fronted Amazon tied by one leg
with a piece of string to one of the forms in the schoolroom. Some
of the girls had tried with sticks and brooms to drive it out of doors,,
but Pollie refused to go, realizing perhaps that this was an orphanage!
I took the bird home, it was a beautiful bird, very tame, and a
good talker. It lived in my aviary for several years.

The other Parrot was brought to me by a working man who lived
near here. He was feeding his chickens one morning and was surprised
to see the Parrot fly down and feed with them.
He asked me to purchase the bird. I said I would try to find
the owner first, but we did not succeed in this. It was a beautiful
cock Alexandrine Bock Parrot, and proved to be one of the tamest
birds I ever had.
I received a letter a short time since from my brother in south-west
Texas, saying that a pair of the smallest kind of Humming Birds had
built a nest in a cluster of blue rose-trees in the garden near the sleeping
porch which I occupied on the two occasions when staying at his
house. I am hoping to hear further about the nesting of these
interesting birds.

The full reference to the breeding of these Waxbills in Germany
mentioned by a South African member in our August number (p. 199)
is a long article in the German periodical devoted to foreign bird culture,
Vogel Ferner Lander , Heft i, Band vi (1932), p. 24, in which the successful
breeder, Herr Thiess, of Zwenkau, gives a full account of the event.
After several failures in the early summer of 1931 in which the birds
got as far as young hatched but dying in the nest, their owner finished
the season with three young reared from two broods (apparently from
two pairs), and writing at the end of January, 1932, describes the three
as one cock and two hens all fully coloured and almost exactly like their
parents. The whole account is well worth study in spite of being
difficult to read--too difficult in fact for me--and for its translation
I am indebted to Mr. A. E. Daniels.
It would be interesting to discover who was actually the first to
succeed, Herr Thiess or one of the South African aviculturists mentioned
in the note, to which I refer above ? Perhaps one of them will let us
have particulars and dates of his success.

The Parrot Importation Ban
THE PARROT IMPORTATION BAN
At a recent meeting of the Council of the Avieultural Society, the
Hon. Secretary was requested to write to the Ministry of Health,
asking whether steps could not be taken to remove, or at least modify,
the Regulations at present in force prohibiting the importation of
Parrots into Great Britain. The following reply was received:--

I am directed by the Minister of Health to refer to your letter of
the 24th ultimo, addressed to Dr. Sturdee, and to state that the whole
question was recently considered by the Psittacosis Commission
appointed by the Office International d'Hygiene publique. The
Permanent Committee&apos; of the Office International approved the report
of the Commission at its Session on the 3rd May last and decided in

With very great regret we have to record the death of Mr. H. L. Sich,
which took place at his home in Worthing on 27th October. Mr. Sich
joined the Society in 1902 and has been a regular contributor to our

observer of the habits of his birds, and his articles, two of which appear
in the present number, were always of very great interest. As late as
23rd October, four days before he died, the writer received the following

" I send you some copy which may be useful. Another failure was with
these beautiful little Indian Porphyrios. They were out all the winter, as
it was mild I did not trouble. Then I got laid up and the frost came. When
I was about again I found one, the hen, had got all the toes of one foot frost-
bitten, rendering mating difficult and resulting in four out of five eggs being
infertile ; they let the one chick die in trying to hatch out the other eggs.
I found it dead with the hind-quarters pecked about, they may have killed
it themselves. It was covered with black down, the beak whitish with curious
black stripes like a dog's muzzle. Both birds incubated about twenty days.
They paired again but did not lay. They seemed quite harmless to small
birds and their nests."
FRANK FINN, B.A.
We much regret to have to record the death, which took place on
1st October, of Mr. Frank Finn, who had been an Honorary Member
of our Society for many years, and edited this Magazine in 1909.
Born in 1868 he had devoted his life to the study of Natural History.
In 1892 he took part in a collecting expedition to East Africa, and in
1894 was appointed Assistant Superintendent of the Indian Museum,
Calcutta. In the following year he became Deputy Superintendent
of that Museum, a post he retained until 1903. He edited the Zoologist
from 1915 to 1916. He was the author of a number of popular natural
history books as well as scientific papers. Among the former may be
mentioned Fancy Waterfowl (1900) ; Fancy Pheasants (1901) ; Birds
of Calcutta (1901) ; Ornithological and other Oddities (1907) ; Birds of
the Countryside (1907) ; Pets and How to Keep Them (1907) ; Wild
Beasts of the World (1908-9) ; Talks about Birds (1911) ; Wild Animals
of Yesterday and To-day (1913).
In recent years he had turned his attention to poetry and published
Circe&apos;s Worshippers and other Poems (1923) and The Masque of Birds
and other Poems (1926). In 1909, in conjunction with Mr. Douglas
Dewar, he published The Making of Species.
THE LATE WM. SHORE-BAILY
Mr. Shore-Baily, whose death was reported in the October number,
was a keen bird-lover from his early youth. At the age of 23 he went
to California where, in addition to duck-shooting, he had an opportunity

of observing many birds that were entirely new to him. On returning to
England and engaging in business he was unable to do much travelling,
except purely on business, for some time, but subsequently he was
able to pay visits to Norway, Brazil, Holland, Spain, France, and the
Canaries, on all of which he took the keenest interest in studying the
birds. In 1910 he commenced keeping birds in captivity and he joined
the Avicultural Society in 1920. His large garden at Westbury was
well suited for the construction of aviaries of the kind he specially
liked--very large wired-in enclosures through which streams flowed
and vegetation grew luxuriantly and where his birds would be in
practically a state of nature. Several such aviaries were built and
their success is proved by the fact that he was awarded no less than
thirty-six medals for breeding foreign birds for the first time in the
United Kingdom. At one time he had nearly a thousand birds in
outdoor aviaries. Some would disappear and be almost forgotten
when, one day, the hidden nest, containing eggs or young birds, would
be discovered amidst the dense foliage. Often a strange bird would
be observed and its identity not be discovered until careful watching
showed it to be the offspring of some bird whose nest was not suspected.
Mr. Shore-Baily was very interested in the eggs of birds, especially
those of the Waders and the Birds of Prey of which he owned a valuable
collection.
